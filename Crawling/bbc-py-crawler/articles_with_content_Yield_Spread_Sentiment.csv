Yield Spread Sentiment,The eerie story behind the newest US national park,2024-09-14,2024-05-07,Heather Mundt,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20240506-the-amache-national-historic-site-how-an-abandoned-prison-became-the-newest-us-national-park,"During World War Two, this haunting site was home to more than 7,500 interned Japanese Americans and was 50% more crowded than New York City. Situated in on the barren, windy plains near the Colorado-Kansas border, about a 3.5-hour drive south-east of Denver and its famous Rocky Mountain skyline, the Granada Relocation Center isn't a place where many travellers go. But that may soon change.  Abandoned in 1945 at the end of World War Two, the centre (officially called the Amache National Historic Site) only includes a handful of reconstructed and restored army-style barracks, a water tower and a guard tower sprouting from the prairie's dry shortgrass and sagebrush. But look closely, and you'll find traces of the more than 10,000 Japanese Americans who were either incarcerated or processed here from 1942-1945. ""It might seem like there's not much out there,"" said Dr Bonnie J Clark, a professor and curator of archaeology at the University of Denver who co-directs the Amache Project, which researches and helps preserve the site. ""But the more time you spend, it's just a really powerful and evocative place.""  In February 2024, these haunting ruins located just outside the 400-person hamlet of Granada,  Colorado, officially became the newest (and perhaps most unlikely) US national park. According to Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland, the site's establishment as federally protected land is a critical step in remembering the painful history that Japanese Americans endured. ""As a nation, we must face the wrongs of our past in order to build a more just and equitable future,"" Haaland said in a statement. ""The Interior Department has the tremendous honour of stewarding America's public lands and natural and cultural resources to tell a complete and honest story of our nation's history."" Following Japan's Pearl Harbor attack on 7 December 1941, a wave of anti-Japanese sentiment spread across the nation, with many suspecting that Japanese and Japanese Americans might act as espionage agents and enemies of the state. In March 1942, US President Franklin Roosevelt authorised military commanders to forcibly remove all persons deemed a threat to national security.  The order didn't specify one ethnic group. But it paved the way for the US to order the removal of Japanese nationals and US citizens of Japanese ancestry to remote incarceration centres  across the Western US – including Amache. The mass expulsion impacted more than 120,000 men, women and children of Japanese ancestry – two-thirds of whom were US citizens. Given only between four days and two weeks' notice, residents were ordered to pack their belongings and abandon their homes for incarceration. Initially, some people were sent to temporary ""assembly centres"" that were cobbled together on fairgrounds and racetracks until permanent camps could be constructed (many by incarcerees themselves). Because these incarceration camps were rarely discussed among the Japanese American community after the war ended in 1945, descendants, like Dr Kirsten Leong, often knew very little about their family's history. ""The fact that I didn't know a lot about the experience is pretty common for my generation,"" said Leong, whose maternal grandmother's family was held at Amache.  As a child, Leong recalls hearing just one story about her relatives being forced from their Los Angeles home to an assembly centre just 13 miles away in city of Arcadia. Here at the famous Santa Anita Racetrack, where champion thoroughbred Seabiscuit had raced to victory only two years prior, people were forced to live in converted horse stalls.  ""My grandmother always wrinkled up her nose and made a face,"" Leong said. ""I never understood that until I learned that three days before, the horses were living in the horse stalls.""  Leong's family was transferred after a few months to Amache, one of the US' 10 confinement sites, named ""relocation centres"". From Tule Lake in California to Heart Mountain in Wyoming and Minidoka in Idaho, the centres were built on isolated public land far from cities and towns. The country's smallest incarceration camp, Amache was the only relocation centre constructed on private land seized by eminent domain (which empowers the US government to take private property and convert it for public use). It opened on 27 August 1942 and quickly ballooned into Colorado's 10th-largest city, with roughly 7,500 people confined to just one square mile during its peak – making it 50% more densely populated than New York City at the time, according to the National Park Service.  In many ways, Amache's unlikely evolution from abandoned prison to US national park is thanks to a former Granada High School teacher and current principal named John Hopper. In 1993, Hopper began documenting Amache's history as a class project and established the Amache Preservation Society (APS). With the help of volunteer students and organisations like the town of Granada and the University of Denver, the APS reconstructed the site's buildings, renovated its cemetery and established the Amache Museum and research centre in Granada. More like this: • The samurai who forever changed California • How the Transcontinental railroad forever changed the US • The sweet symbol of Japanese America ""The mostly Japanese American internees lived for more than three years within the one square mile that stretches out before you now to the south,"" said a guide on the free self-driving tour, which offered historical context as I moved through each stop.  Despite the camp's harsh circumstances, the internees worked together to survive and created an active community. Organised like a military camp, there were 29 residential blocks, each containing 12 barracks used for living quarters, plus a mess hall and recreation hall. Six families lived in one barrack and shared bathroom facilities, allowing little privacy. In addition, there were hospitals and schools, social activities and sports programmes, even Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts. Families grew crops, created a successful silk-screen shop and established a co-op with barber shops, shoe stores and more. Detainees living behind the barbed wire did their best to maintain a sense of normalcy, even as armed guards patrolled the camp and manned the eight guard towers surrounding the perimeter.  Amache closed after WW2, and once the last people left in October 1945, its buildings were demolished or sold off to the public.  Every two years since 2008 (minus 2020), Clark conducts archaeological field work and research at the site alongside students and Amache survivors and descendants. At the end of each summer, she presents her findings at open houses for Amache families  and the general public. Over the years, she has found evidence that residents planted gardens and uncovered the remains of a sumo pit, Japanese baths, footpaths and baseball fields. Thousands of cottonwood and Siberian elm trees they planted are reminders of life at Amache.  ""That investment in a place [where] people didn't choose to live, I think, really speaks to an insistence on your own humanity and also on taking care of one another,"" Clark said. Although Leong still knows very little about her family's life at Amache, other than hearing one uncle had graduated from the prison's high school and the other taught there, she learned more when she began volunteering with Clark in 2012.  What's evident to her is how the prejudice that sought to disband Japanese communities following WW2 has rippled into modern times. Not only did incarceration affect Japanese American family structures, it also created generational trauma beyond WW2, when people were given incentives to start new lives away from the Japanese American communities that no longer existed across much of the West Coast.  ""They were allowed to go back 'home', but there was no home to go back to,"" Leong said. ""My generation [is] now discovering, 'Oh, so that's why I don't know any other Japanese people. That's why we don't talk about our heritage.""  Today, visitors to the newest US national park can see the three decades of APS' preservation efforts, like the restored towers and recreation hall, as well as the cemetery and ""monument house"". Originally built as a columbarium, the monument house was supposed to protect cremated remains. But because the incarcerees didn't want to leave behind ashes after being released in 1945, it now houses a memorial to honour those who passed away while incarcerated at Amache. A second memorial inscribed with US military casualties from Amache was erected in the cemetery in 1983. According to Amache site manager Christopher Mather, it will take a few years for the NPS to implement more educational programming and a dedicated visitor's centre. But by late summer 2024, Mather says staff will be on site to escort visitors on free tours inside the recreation hall and barracks. (Check the NPS site for updated information.) In the meantime, the NPS says that the self-driving tour created by the APS is the best way for visitors to learn about the site's history. Mather suggests that visitors start at the Amache Museum, located about 1.5 miles from the Amache National Historic Site. There, visitors can see historical photographs and documents of the prisons - as well as archaeological finds from the site and objects donated by survivors – from an intricate kimono to a simple suitcase that held the precious few personal belongings people were allowed. It’s also where to get maps and historical fact from NPS staff, who work inside its offices, before visiting the actual/physical camp. ""The museum is where a lot of people will get the information that they'll need to then go out and really get the best experience on site,"" Mather said.  Mather recognises that Amache's new designation as a national park is the culmination of decades of work. But by sharing the stories of survival and pain, he hopes that their experiences will echo into the future. ""It's a story that needs to be told,"" he said, ""so that it doesn't happen again."" -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

Yield Spread Sentiment,'Raised to hate tourists' - Fires fan tensions on Maui,2024-09-14,2023-08-15,By Holly Honderich & Max Matza in Maui,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66507019,"After wildfires devastated parts of the Hawaiian island of Maui, one of the most popular tourist destinations in the US, officials warned visitors to stay away. But thousands remained and others continued to fly in, angering residents in the wake of the tragedy. At Maui's Wailea Beach on Monday the skies were bright and clear. Luxury hotels lined the beachfront, their guests spread on the sand. Some waded in the ocean, while others sat under umbrellas with white monogrammed towels on their chairs.   Inside one of the hotels, beyond a pool, a two-tiered fountain and a glass-walled habitat for the resident parrot, was a wooden-framed screen advertising a relief fund for the resort's employees - the first sign of the destruction in Lahaina, just 30 miles (48km) up the coast. In the wake of the wildfires, the deadliest in modern US history, frustration at tourists who have chosen to carry on with their holidays has grown. Many in Maui say the devastation has highlighted what is known as the ""two Hawaiis"" - one built for the comfort of visitors and another, harsher Hawaii left to Hawaiians.  ""It's all butterflies and rainbows when it comes to the tourism industry,"" said a 21-year-old Maui native and an employee at the hotel who asked to remain anonymous. ""But what's really under it is kind of scary.""  Last Wednesday, a day after the wildfires, the county asked visitors to leave Lahaina and the island as a whole as soon as possible.  Officials soon urged people to avoid the island entirely, except for essential travel. ""In the days and weeks ahead, our collective resources and attention must be focused on the recovery of residents and communities that were forced to evacuate,"" the Hawaii Tourism Authority said. Many travellers heeded the advice. In the immediate aftermath of the fires, some 46,000 people left the island. The grass field separating the airport from the surrounding highway is now lined with rows upon rows of suddenly surplus rental cars. But thousands did not. Some ignored requests to leave Maui immediately, while others flew in after the fire - decisions that have angered some. ""If this was happening to your hometown, would you want us to come?"" said resident Chuck Enomoto. ""We need to take care of our own first.""  Another Maui local told the BBC that tourists were swimming in the ""same waters that our people died in three days ago"" - an apparent reference to a snorkelling excursion on Friday just 11 miles from Lahaina. The snorkelling company later apologised for running the tour, saying it had first ""offered our vessel throughout the week to deliver supplies and rescue people but its design wasn't appropriate for the task"".  But the opposition to tourists is not without complications given the island is economically reliant on those travellers. The Maui Economic Development Board has estimated that the island's ""visitor industry"" accounts for roughly four out of every five dollars generated here, calling those visitors the ""economic engine"" of the county.  ""You're kind of raised to hate tourists,"" said the young hotel worker. ""But that's really the only way to work on the islands. If it's not hospitality then it's construction.""  Several business owners expressed concern that the growing anti-tourist sentiment could hurt Maui further.  ""What I'm afraid of is that if people keep seeing 'Maui's closed', and 'don't come to Maui', what little business is left is going to be gone,"" said Daniel Kalahiki, who owns a food truck in Wailuku. Sales have already dropped by 50% since the fire, he said. ""And then the island is going to lose everything."" Still, in the days after the fire, the disparity between Maui residents - reeling from catastrophic loss - and the insulated tourist hotspots has been laid bare.  In one Hawaii, locals face an acute housing crisis. Many live in modest one-storey homes in neighbourhoods like Kahului and Kīhei, some in multi-family dwellings, with each family separated by a curtain or a thin plywood wall. And working a number of jobs is common, locals told the BBC, to keep up with rising costs. Jen Alcantara shrugged off surprise that she worked for a Canadian airline in addition to a senior administrative position at Maui's hospital. ""That's Hawaii,"" she said.  In this Hawaii, the effects of the fires are everywhere. At shops and grocery stores, evacuees look for essentials, trying to replace their lost possessions with whatever money they have. At restaurants, workers can be seen in kitchens and behind bars holding back tears and making phone calls to co-ordinate relief efforts.  Here, collections were being taken for the survivors nearly everywhere you look. An upscale coffee shop in Kahului was offering to refrigerate donated breast milk. Food truck owners were volunteering their services to the front line and farmers were carrying bunches of bananas to shelters. Things are different in the other Hawaii.  As you reach the end of the 30-minute drive from the island's urban centre to Wailea, home to Maui's high-end holiday rentals and resorts, the earth suddenly changes, dry brown grasses become a rich, watered green.   ""It's a blunt line,"" one local said, another hotel employee who did not want to be named.  Inside Wailea, gated communities border golf courses, that are connected to luxury hotels. Inside those hotels, obliging staff provide surf lessons and pool-side meals, including a $29 burger.  Staff told the BBC that many of the guests were sympathetic to the crisis on the west of the island. Others had complained about scheduled activities in Lahaina - horse-riding, ziplining - being cancelled, said Brittany Pounder, 34, an employee at the Four Seasons.  The day after the fires, one guest visiting from California, asked if he could still get to his dinner reservation at the Lahaina Grill - a restaurant in one of the hardest-hit areas of the town. ""It's not OK,"" Ms Pounder said.  There is mounting concern that the eventual rebuild of Lahaina will further cater to this second Hawaii.  Already, wealthy visitors have contributed to exorbitant house prices, buying land and property in a place where homeownership is out of reach for many permanent residents. Famous billionaires Peter Thiel and Jeff Bezos both have homes in Maui. Oprah Winfrey is the island's largest landowner.  Rumours have spread of estate agents approaching Hawaiian property owners in Lahaina, asking about possible deals.  Several locals told the BBC they worried Lahaina would be refashioned into another Waikiki, the ritzy waterfront of Honolulu, dominated by oceanfront high-rises and branded luxury shopping. ""We don't need another Waikiki,"" said Chuck Enomoto. ""But it's inevitable.""  How have you been affected by the fires in Maui? Please share your story by emailing haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk.

Yield Spread Sentiment,US commemorates 19th anniversary of 9/11,2024-09-14,2020-09-11,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-54123146,"Rivals for the White House have displayed a moment of unity as the US marks the 19th anniversary of the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks. Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden greeted Vice-President Mike Pence at the Ground Zero memorial in New York, where each attended ceremonies. Mr Biden then travelled to Shanksville, Pennsylvania - the site of the Flight 93 memorial - to pay respects.  President Donald Trump spoke there earlier on Friday. However Mr Biden and Mr Trump did not cross paths because their schedules did not overlap. Nearly 3,000 people died when four hijacked airliners were crashed into the World Trade Center in New York, the Pentagon and - after passengers fought back - the field in Shanksville, on what is the worst terrorist attack in US history. Joined by First Lady Melania Trump, Mr Trump attended a morning service at the Shanksville memorial, where Flight 93 crashed after its 40 passengers and crew prevented al-Qaeda hijackers from reaching the US Capitol building. ""To the family members of Flight 93: today every heartbeat in America is wedded to yours,"" Mr Trump said.  ""Your pain and anguish is the shared grief of our whole nation."" ""The memory of your treasured loved ones will inspire America for all time to come. The heroes of Flight 93 are an everlasting reminder that no matter the danger, no matter the threat, no matter the odds, America will always rise up, stand tall and fight back."" Although both Mr Trump and Mr Biden will refrain from overt campaigning, their separate visits to Pennsylvania are being watched closely, as the state is seen as a key battleground in the 3 November election.  Before his Shanksville visit, Mr Trump made a brief stop in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, to greet members of the state Army National Guard. The iron-and-steel town is in Cambria County - the heart of what has been known as 'Trump country' - in the southwest of the state.  Mr Trump spoke with three officers about local military and thanked them for their service, local media reported.  Mr Trump narrowly beat Hillary Clinton in the state in 2016 and with the election less than eight weeks away, the president is fighting hard to keep towns like Johnstown on his side, says BBC's Tara McKelvey.  Mr Biden and his wife, Jill, attended a memorial service and commemoration ceremony at the 9/11 museum in New York City. They travelled to Shanksville in the afternoon to visit the same memorial as Mr Trump. Mr Biden was seen greeting family members of those killed in the attack. He and his wife laid a wreath on the memorial as well. Mr Biden told reporters earlier on Friday he would not talk about anything other than 9/11 and that his campaign had withdrawn political adverts from airing on television. ""We took all our advertising down, it's a solemn day, and that's how we're going to keep it,"" he said. Mr Biden greeted Mr Pence at the World Trade Center site in New York earlier in the day, and the pair touched elbows in lieu of a handshake to observe protocols aimed at preventing the spread of coronavirus. Mr Biden referenced the pandemic in a series of tweets later in the day, saying: ""This year, we mark the anniversary of 9/11 in the midst of another crisis that compels us to summon the best of the American people in the face of unconscionable, inconceivable loss."" Mr Pence delivered short remarks in New York City and read passages from the Bible, saying: ""I pray these ancient words will comfort your hearts and ours."" New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, also joined Mr Pence and Mr Biden at the memorial service. On US Twitter, hashtags relating to 9/11 are trending, with people remembering the day and sharing stories of loved ones lost in the attacks. Some on social media have also drawn attention to the anti-Muslim sentiment that spread across the country in the wake of 9/11, noting how they were bullied, stereotyped, or policed.  Hate crimes rose against Muslims after the 2001 attacks, FBI data found. The 9/11 attacks were a series of four coordinated attacks on the US by the Islamist terror group al-Qaeda.  As well as the 3,000 people killed on 11 September 2001, some 400,000 people were injured or exposed to other contaminants in the aftermath of the attacks, according to the US Centers for Disease Control. Hundreds of first responders and survivors have died in the years since due to related illnesses, like cancer. Weeks after the attack, the US sent troops to Afghanistan to combat al-Qaeda. The so-called 'War on Terror' has stretched decades and American intervention in the Middle East continues to be a quagmire of US foreign policy. "

Yield Spread Sentiment,Why are university students catching mumps?,2024-09-14,2019-03-31,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-47736643,"Mumps - a contagious viral infection that causes swelling of the glands - has been in the news this week following a confirmed outbreak at two universities. A total of 223 suspected cases were reported, with 40 confirmed, across Nottingham Trent University and the University of Nottingham.  That has now risen to 241 suspected cases with 51 confirmed by Public Health England (PHE). BBC News has taken a look at why this is and whether university students are still at risk. The numbers seem particularly high in Nottingham.  PHE said latest figures showed cases of mumps in England had decreased in 2018, with 1,024 confirmed cases compared with 1,796 in 2017. There have also been a handful of reported cases at the universities of Bath, Hull and Liverpool and in the US - specifically Temple University, in Philadelphia, which has recorded about 100 people with signs of the infection. There does not appear to be any reason as to why the Nottingham numbers are much higher, though experts have said it could be that there are more in the city who are not immune. Prof Jonathan Ball, from the University of Nottingham - an expert in viruses and viral vaccines and treatments - said it was affecting students because they gathered in ""close proximity for fairly large periods of time"". This would include in halls of residence, lecture theatres or even at nightclubs, which hold specific nights aimed at students. ""The virus [could] spread fairly easy, especially if there are relatively large numbers of people who have not been vaccinated,"" he said. A marine biology student at the University of Hull, who did not want to give his name, said he started feeling ill while on a field trip to the Isle of Cumbrae in Scotland. He said a local doctor diagnosed mumps but also sent away a swab for it to be confirmed, as mumps is a notifiable disease in England and Wales. The 19-year-old, who said he knew at least two others who had the symptoms, had to be isolated and driven home, avoiding public transport because of the risk of others being infected. Yes. Dr Vanessa MacGregor, from PHE, said it had seen a rise in figures recently, with teenagers and young adults who have not had two doses of the MMR vaccine ""particularly vulnerable"". The NHS says the vaccine is part of the routine childhood immunisation schedule, in which a child is given one dose when they are 12 to 13 months old, and a second at three years and four months. Dr MacGregor urged those who have not had the MMR vaccine - or only received one dose - to ensure they took up the offer of MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccination. The University of Hull student also said it was ""strange"" he had contracted the infection because he had received both doses and this had been confirmed by his father. According to Prof Ball, the mumps part of the vaccine is the ""least effective"". He said: ""For the mumps vaccine, we expect about 88% of people vaccinated to be protected, whereas for the measles vaccine this is as high as 98%.  ""If you then add unvaccinated people into the mix, it is easy to see how a relatively contagious virus as mumps can spread so easily."" He said this was further complicated, because some people who are infected show little or no symptoms at all. However, if the majority were vaccinated, those susceptible to the infection would benefit from ""herd immunity"", the level considered by experts to protect a population from a disease. But, as Prof Ball states: ""If you start to reduce the numbers of people being vaccinated, then that herd protection just isn't there."" According to BBC Health Editor Hugh Pym, the reason for uptake declining in many countries was not clear. The ""damaging"" work of discredited scientist and struck-off medic Andrew Wakefield in the 1990s ""helped fuel the fire of the anti-vaccine movement,"" according to Prof Ball. In 1998, the doctor led a study that linked the MMR vaccine to autism, impacting on the coverage of the vaccine, with rates dropping to about 80% in the late 1990s and a low of 79% in 2003. Rates partially recovered after the research was disproved but the volume of anti-vaccine sentiment on social media has increased in recent years. This led Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock to call for new laws to force social media companies to remove content that promoted false information about vaccines. Prof Ball said there were rarely ""side effects"" with vaccines and even if there were, the benefits outweighed these. ""Because we have lived through a golden age of vaccination, we have forgotten just how harmful, and sometimes even fatal, these virus infections can be,"" he said. Dr Natalie Riddell, a lecturer in immunology and ageing at the University of Surrey, said a reduced amount of people being vaccinated against any contagious disease was dangerous. ""Babies and immuno-compromised people [such as the elderly or those receiving chemotherapy] rely on the rest of us to be vaccinated to prevent the spread of disease,"" she said. ""It is totally unnecessary for people to risk their friends and family becoming ill, or even dying, from measles or mumps, as there is a safe and effective vaccine to protect against both."" Prof Ball said poor vaccine uptake worldwide had led to an increase in outbreaks of mumps and measles and we should ""expect things to get worse"" before they get better.

Yield Spread Sentiment,Bangladesh's Hindus in fear following mob attacks,2024-09-14,2021-10-21,By Anbarasan Ethirajan,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-58999047,"Like many Hindus, Bonolata Das believed a temple was a safe and sacred place.  She wasn't worried when she allowed her 21-year-old son, Pranta Chandra Das, a college student, to stay at a temple complex last week in Bangladesh's south-eastern Noakhali district.  But tragedy struck. He was allegedly beaten to death there by hundreds of religious fundamentalists in the Muslim-majority nation.  ""My youngest son was so close to my heart. After his death, I have lost my heart and have lost everything,"" Mrs Das said, crying inconsolably. Her son was a victim of mob violence that began after rumours spread that the Quran had been insulted at a special pavilion set up for the annual Hindu religious festival, Durga Puja, in the town of Comilla.  Within hours of the rumour spreading on social media, hundreds of Muslim fundamentalists went on a rampage targeting Hindu religious pavilions in Comilla. Soon, the violence spread to other parts of Bangladesh. Temples were desecrated and hundreds of houses and businesses of the Hindu minority torched. Seven people, including two Hindus, were killed and many more injured in days of violence. Police opened fire and used tear gas in several places to contain the raging mob.  After hearing about the attack on the temple, which is run by the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), Mrs Das and her family frantically searched for her son. His body was found a day later in a nearby pond. It was marked by injuries, she said.  ""We are scared to go back to our home and afraid of further attack,"" Mrs Das told the BBC. ""At the moment, I am staying in the temple itself."" Hindus constitute less than 9% of Bangladesh's more than 165 million population. Though there have been several attacks on religious minorities in the past, community leaders say this is the worst large-scale mob violence against the community in the country's history. ""It was a pre-planned attack on the Hindu community,"" said Achinta Das, the head of the Hindu festival committee in Comilla town. He denied that Hindus would offend a religious text like the Quran.  A day after the temple attack, prime minister Sheikh Hasina condemned the violence, saying the perpetrators ""must be found out"". ""We did so in the past and will do it in future as well,"" she said. ""They must face appropriate punishments."" Despite her warning, the violence spread to other parts of Bangladesh, triggering fear and panic among members of the minority community. At one point, the government had to deploy security forces in 22 districts to control the riots. Nearly a week after the violence began, dozens of Hindu houses were torched in northern Bangladesh after another social media post reportedly alleged Hindus were defaming the Islamic holy place. ""When we heard the mob was coming, I ran with my two young children to save ourselves and we were hiding in a paddy field,"" said Nanda Rani, from Birgunj in Rangpur district told the BBC. ""From there we could see the mob setting fire to our house. It's totally destroyed. We are now living in tents.""  The Bangladeshi home minister, Asaduzzaman Khan said hundreds of people had been arrested and an investigation had been launched. He told reporters that people were intentionally spreading ""propaganda"" by ""uploading video footage of many brutal incidents that took place in the country in different times and in the past"" in order to mislead others.  Leaders of Islamist movements have said they are opposed to violence against any minorities. ""Those attacking temples should be punished. We all should live in peace and harmony,"" said Maulana Mujibur Rahman Hamidi, the vice chairman of the Bangladesh Khilafat Andolan, an Islamist political party. But Muslim leaders, including Mr Hamidi, have also publicly called for harsh punishments against those who defame Islam. Bangladesh has prided itself on its secular credentials since it gained independence from Pakistan in 1971. Though the constitution stipulates Islam as the state religion, it also upholds the principle of secularism.  But analysts point out that hard-line Islamist groups have gained prominence over the years and the governing Awami League, which has been in power since 2008, had failed to tackle the rising religious intolerance and fundamentalism.  ""The government has for political expediency compromised with the fundamentalist forces, particularly in the back drop of constrained democratic polity,"" said Debapriya Bhattacharya, an eminent economist.  ""As a result, fundamentalists have got prominence, recognition and influence,"" he said. The subcontinent has a long history of religious violence, dating back to 1947 when British India was carved into Hindu-dominated India and Muslim-majority Pakistan.  In 1971, Bangladesh, then East Pakistan, gained independence from Pakistan after a bloody war. India sent in its troops in support of the Bangladesh war of independence. The shadow of partition still hangs over South Asia. ""The attacks on the Hindu community in Bangladesh have been systematic over the decades,"" said Rana Dasgupta, General-Secretary of the country's Hindu, Buddhist and Christian Unity Council.  ""There is an orchestrated attempt to grab Hindu houses and lands in Bangladesh and they are being forced to leave the country."" Hindu community leaders say their population has come down from 30% in 1947 to less than 9% now. Most have fled to neighbouring India. Rights campaigners insist successive governments have failed to take prompt action against repeated attacks on religious minorities.  ""The lack of a proper investigation not only shows a pattern but also complacency when it comes to protecting minorities,"" said Saad Hammadi, South Asia campaigner for Amnesty International. ""The communal violence is recurring because of perceived impunity and a lack of effective remedy."" The Bangladeshi law minister, Anisul Huq, denied the investigations on the attacks on the minorities were not making any progress. ""All those incidents were being investigated. In such cases, it takes a little time. We are trying to speed up the investigation as much as possible,"" Mr Huq told the BBC. He also rejected criticism that the government was appeasing the Islamists. ""Any notion of that kind is not correct. We want all members of all religions to live harmoniously."" Some say that rising anti-Muslim sentiment across the border in India, under the Hindu-nationalist BJP party, is partly responsible for triggering anger among hardline Bangladeshi Muslims. The BJP has stoked fear of immigration from Bangladesh, causing anger in Dhaka, and Hindu hardliners in India have called for immigrants to be deported to Bangladesh.  ""What's happening in India - the treatment of religious minorities - is very unfortunate. It is also being used by some as an excuse to persecute the minorities in Bangladesh,"" said Mr Bhattacharya, the economist.  ""But it is the duty of each government to treat their own citizens properly, and to protect their rights and their security,"" he said. Salman Saeed in Dhaka contributed to this report."
Yield Spread Sentiment,"The good, the bad and the awkward: US presidents in India",2024-09-14,2020-02-22,By Rajini Vaidyanathan,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-51569605,"US President Donald Trump is expecting a raucous welcome on his first official state visit to India on Monday and Tuesday. He follows a long line of leaders who have made the journey. Some of his predecessors were greeted enthusiastically and one even had a village named after him; others stumbled through diplomatic gaffes. Can history be a guide to how this diplomatic tryst might go? Here's a brief look at past visits- the good, the bad and the awkward. Let's begin at the beginning.  Dwight D Eisenhower, the first US president to visit India, was greeted with a 21-gun salute when he landed in the national capital, Delhi, in December 1959. Huge crowds lined the streets to catch a glimpse of the World War Two hero in his open-top car - Mr Trump is expecting a similar reception in Ahmedabad city, where he will be doing a road show.  The warmth between Eisenhower and Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru helped during what was a rocky phase in US-India ties. This was early in the Cold war, when the US and Pakistan had become become close allies, and India insisted on staying neutral or ""non-aligned"". Like today, relations with China were at the core of the India-US equation, with Washington pressuring Delhi to take an aggressive stance with Beijing on the issue of Tibet.  But, on the whole, Eisenhower's four-day trip was billed a success. And nearly every US president on a state visit to India has emulated his itinerary: he laid flowers at Mahatma Gandhi's memorial, took in the splendour of the Taj Mahal, addressed parliament and spoke at Delhi's iconic Ramlila grounds, which, according to one news report, attracted one million people.  When he left, Nehru said he had taken with him ""a piece of our heart"".  Richard Nixon was no stranger to India when he arrived in August 1969 for a day-long state visit. He had been here as vice-president in 1953, and before that on personal trips but, by all accounts, he wasn't a fan.  ""Nixon disliked Indians in general and despised [Prime Minister] Indira Gandhi,"" according to Gary Bass, author of Blood Telegram: Nixon, Kissinger and a Forgotten Genocide. And, he adds, the feeling was said to be mutual.  This was also at the height of the Cold War, and India's non-alignment policy ""appalled"" American presidents. Bass says that under Gandhi, India's neutrality had turned into a ""noticeably pro-Soviet foreign policy"".  The relationship only turned frostier after the trip as India backed Bangladesh (then East Pakistan) in its fight for independence from Pakistan, a close American ally. The differences were laid bare when Gandhi visited the White House in 1971. Tape recordings - the so-called White House Tapes -  later revealed that Nixon had referred to her as an ""old witch"". Although Jimmy Carter's two-day visit in 1978 marked a thaw in India-US relations, it was not free of hiccups.   With some 500 reporters in tow, Mr Carter followed a packed itinerary: he met Prime Minister Morarji Desai, addressed a joint session of parliament, went to the Taj Mahal, and dropped by a village just outside Delhi.  The village, Chuma Kheragaon, had a personal connection: Mr Carter's mother, Lillian, had visited here when she was in India as a member of the Peace Corps in the late 1960s. So when Mr Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, made the trip, they gave the village money and its first television set. It was even renamed ""Carterpuri"", a moniker it still holds.  But beyond the photo-ops, India and the US were sparring. India was building its nuclear programme, and had conducted its first test in 1974. The US wanted India to sign the NPF, which sought to stop the spread of nuclear weapons. But India refused, saying the agreement discriminated against developing countries.  In a leaked conversation that made headlines and threatened to derail the visit, Mr Carter promised his Secretary of State, Cyrus Vance, a ""very cold and very blunt"" letter to Desai. The two leaders signed a declaration, promising greater global co-operation, but Mr Carter left India without the assurances he had hoped for.  If there was a game-changing visit, it would be Bill Clinton's in March 2000 with Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Mr Clinton's arrival came after a two-decade lull - neither Ronald Reagan nor George Bush Snr made the journey East. It came at a tricky time as Washington had imposed sanctions on Delhi following its 1999 test of a nuclear bomb.  But, according to Navtej Sarna, a former Indian ambassador to the US, the five-day trip was ""a joyous visit"". It included stops in Hyderabad, a southern city that was emerging as a tech hub, and Mumbai, India's financial capital. ""He came and saw the economic and cyber potential of India, and democracy in action,"" says Mr Sarna.  Mr Clinton also danced with villagers, took a tiger safari and sampled Delhi's famously creamy black dal (lentils) at a luxury hotel that has since been associated with the president.  The country's reaction is perhaps best expressed in this New York Times headline: ""Clinton fever - a delighted India has all the symptoms."" George W Bush, as Forbes magazine once put it, was the ""best US president India's ever had"". His three-day visit in March 2006 was a highlight in the two countries' strategic relationship - especially in matters of trade and nuclear technology, subjects they have long wrangled over. His strong personal dynamic with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was hard to miss - after he left office, Mr Bush, a keen artist, even painted a portrait of Mr Singh.  The two leaders are credited for a historic but controversial nuclear deal, which was signed during Mr Bush's visit. It brought India, which had for decades refused to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), out of isolation. Energy-hungry India got access to US civil nuclear technology in exchange for opening its nuclear facilities to inspection.  However, while the visit was substantive, it was not as spectacular as others - there was no trip to the Taj, nor an address to parliament. But the timing was important. Anti-US sentiment over the invasion of Iraq was running high - left-wing MPs had staged a protest against Mr Bush's visit, and there were demonstrations in other parts of India.  Barack Obama was the only president to make two official visits. First, in 2010 with Mr Singh, and then in 2015 with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. On his first visit - in a break from the past - he landed in Mumbai,  instead of Delhi, with a large trade delegation. This was not just about economic ties but a show of solidarity following the Mumbai terror attacks of 2008, which killed 166 people. Mr and Mrs Obama even stayed at the Taj Mahal hotel, one of the main targets.  It was significant that the US president declared support for India to join a reformed and expanded UN Security Council, says Alyssa Ayres, a former US deputy assistant secretary of state for South Asia. ""That all these years later nothing has changed in the UN system is another matter, but that was a major policy shift for the United States."" Mr Obama returned in 2015 as chief guest at India's Republic Day celebrations, at PM Modi's invitation. Trade, defence and climate change were at the heart of the talks. The trip also emphasised an Indo-Pacific strategy, where both leaders expressed unease over Beijing's provocations in the South China Sea. The US and India have certainly had their ups and downs, but during the last official visit in 2015, Mr Obama and Mr Modi signed a declaration of friendship: ""Chalein saath saath [Let's move forward together]..."" it began.  President Trump's visit will take the relationship forward, but it's unclear how.  His arrival in Ahmedabad, the main city in PM Modi's home state of Gujarat, followed by a big arena event, is expected to draw a massive crowd. It will echo Eisenhower's rally in Delhi, perhaps cementing the personal ties between the two leaders.  But while Mr Trump's trip will be packed with pageantry, it could be light on policy. Unlike other presidential visits, this one is not expected to yield many concrete agreements, with the trade deal Mr Trump so badly wants looking unlikely. Follow Rajini on Twitter @BBCRajiniV "
Yield Spread Sentiment,Masked militia sparks alarm in Slovenia,2024-09-14,2018-09-04,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-45407773,"Slovenian President Borut Pahor has expressed concern after social media images revealed a masked armed group led by an ex-presidential candidate. Fringe far-right politician Andrej Sisko said his group - seen conducting training drills - would ""secure public peace and order"" if needed. President Pahor said there was no place for such a group in the country. Police are investigating the group, which posed with assault rifles but denies being a paramilitary unit. Videos posted on Facebook show some 70 masked people allegedly taking a ""solemn oath"".  The group is led by an unmasked Mr Sisko, who once served prison time for attempted murder. He won 2.2% of the vote last year when he ran for president of the small EU state, which was once part of the former Yugoslavia. He lost out to Mr Pahor, whose cabinet said in a statement: ""President Pahor stresses that Slovenia is a safe country in which no unauthorised person needs or is allowed to... illegally care for the security of the country and its borders.""  The outgoing Slovene Prime Minister Miro Cerar said the formation of the unit was ""absolutely unacceptable"" and that it ""needlessly stirs up fear and spreads hatred"". Mr Sisko denied the group - called the Stajerska Guard after a north-eastern region - was doing anything illegal, telling Reuters news agency it was a voluntary defence force consisting of ""several hundred people"". However, he conceded the weapons they carried had not been registered with authorities. By Guy Delauney, BBC correspondent Andrej Sisko is far out on the fringe of Slovenian politics.  He styles himself as a patriot, fighting to preserve the Slovenian people and the country's distinct identity - in the face of much larger neighbours populated by different ethnic groups.  On occasion, this ideological fight has spilled over into real violence.  Mr Sisko served a two-year jail sentence after planting a car bomb. He also has a long track record of forming or joining militia groups. He will welcome the publicity gained by his latest stunt. But the public remain indifferent: his United Slovenia Movement gained just 0.6% of the vote in June's general election. National security expert Iztok Prezelj told local media the group had all the markings of a militia: ""They have a flag and uniform, but also from photographs, it's obvious that they have some common emblem on the T-shirts."" The University of Ljubljana vice-dean added: ""Currently, Slovenia is not at risk of security, so I do not see the need to organise any armed formations, in addition to the army and the police."" ""The police have not visited me so far but I expect their visit,"" Mr Sisko said. ""We are doing nothing wrong and we would be even interested in co-operating with the police."" However he told media that his unit, which was allegedly formed 14 months ago, ""would not watch quietly"" if police attempted to disarm them. In fact, the police might be disarmed instead, Mr Sisko told Slovene daily Delo on Tuesday. His party, the anti-immigrant far-right United Slovenia Movement, has no connection to the militia, he said. Slovenia is due to confirm a new minority government of five centre-left parties in the parliament next week.  An anti-immigrant stand helped the centre-right Slovenian Democratic Party to win most votes at the June election but the party lacked coalition partners to form a government. According to the Slovene media, the new government has already attracted criticism from the opposition for what are seen as its ""radically leftist moves"", and there are concerns that it will take too lax an approach to the issue of migration and the protection of national interests. Anti-migrant sentiment has increased in Slovenia since almost half a million migrants crossed the country on their way to richer EU states in 2015 and 2016. The number of requests for asylum in Slovenia has risen significantly from 277 in the whole of 2015 to 1,717 so far this year.  However, only 77 people have been granted an asylum in 2018, versus 152 in the whole of 2017, interior ministry data showed."
Yield Spread Sentiment,Ojo stunner helps Rangers beat Feyenoord,2024-09-14,2019-09-19,Thomas Duncan,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/49663652,"Ojo's stunning first-half strike gave Rangers a vital victory Rangers paid the perfect tribute to late captain Fernando Ricksen by edging Feyenoord in a rousing Europa League win at an emotional Ibrox. Sheyi Ojo's first-half thunderbolt secured three points after James Tavernier missed an early penalty. There was a minute's silence pre-match and applause in the second minute in tribute to Ricksen, who died on Wednesday after losing his battle with motor neurone disease. Rangers go level with Porto in Group G. The Portuguese side beat Young Boys 2-1 at home, with Steven Gerrard's side travelling to Switzerland in their next match. Feyenoord, meanwhile, will host Porto next, having grown into the game at Ibrox late on but failing to land a decisive blow as Allan McGregor made several good saves to keep them out. Reaction & as it happened Who was your man of the match? So often professional sport is about blocking out emotion. It's about maintaining control, concentration, and a clear mind to carry out the game plan. With the death of Ricksen at the age of just 43 on Wednesday after a heart-breaking six-year fight with motor-neurone disease, there was no escaping emotion at Ibrox. The sea of scarves outside the ground, the touching tributes from former team-mates, the minute's silence and banner before kick-off, the applause during the second minute which spread from the stands to the players on the pitch, it was emotional. Gerrard urged his players to tap into that raw sentiment and, after a shaky start, they duly obliged. There was an intensity to Rangers as they pressed Feyenoord into giving the ball away and crisply set about constructing their own attacks. Ojo's thumping strike was a thing of beauty, but it was the build-up that was perhaps more telling of Rangers' performance. The impressive Steven Davis burst a lung to close down Orkun Kocku, whose heavy touch in-field left the ball up for grabs. Glen Kamara beat his man to the ball, then Borna Barisic also snapped into a challenge and it broke to Ojo who smashed home to send the stadium into bedlam, and consign Tavernier's earlier penalty miss, awarded for a handball, to a distant memory. Rangers weren't nearly done either. Scott Arfield cracked the bar, the bustling Morelos had two tries at beating Kenneth Vermeer in the visitors' goal and then claimed for a penalty as he went for a third effort. Replays though, showed Edgar Ié got a touch on the ball. Goldson also had a couple of headers just over, then Ojo thought he'd doubled his tally only for his shot to be desperately cleared off the line. Feyenoord were rattled, the half-time whistle a mercy.  Fans paid tribute to the late Fernando Ricksen, who died on Wednesday. The Dutch champions of 2017 almost stole an equaliser straight after the break as the ball ricocheted off Goldson from Eric Botteghin's diving header and spun just wide, but largely their distribution from the back was hapless for the most part because of Rangers' intense closing down. But when Feyenoord did manage to play through the press, they showed glimpses which suggested Rangers might need a second, for example when McGregor had to get down smartly to push Dutch international Steven Berghuis' shot wide. Ojo should have got the second as he headed over from point-blank range and Ryan Jack, Davis, Arfield and Morelos all had chances to put the game to bed. With each miss, Feyenoord grew in confidence and themselves had opportunities, the Ibrox crowd growing frustrated at the inability of their team to keep the ball. Ultimately, it didn't matter. McGregor denied Luciano Narsingh and Jens Toornstra superbly to ensure a winning start for his team. It was emotional, the old stadium rocking by the end. But in the cold hard analysis, a home win provides the perfect start in the quest for the knockout stages. The wide midfielder helped lead Rangers' press which caused Feyenoord all sorts of issues. He, Davis, Morelos and Ojo all played their part in hounding the opposition and his energy epitomised their intensity. The Canada international's clever movement inside the full-backs and his link play were also vital, and he was unlucky not to score as he drifted into space to hit a shot which came crashing back off the cross-bar. Substituted with two minutes to go, he could barely run by the end which summed up his commitment. Rangers haven't lost any of their last 14 home games across all European competitions (W10 D4, including qualifiers), winning each of the last five in a row. Rangers picked up their first win against Dutch opposition in European competition since October 1999 (4-1 v PSV in the Champions League) - they were winless in the previous five such games before tonight (D2 L3). Feyenoord have only won one of their last 11 away games across all European competitions (D3 L7), with their only clean sheet in this run coming at Hapoel Be'er Sheva (3-0 in a Europa League qualifier last month). Sheyi Ojo scored his fifth goal of the season for Rangers across all competitions, with four of his five goals coming in European competition (including qualifiers). James Tavernier's penalty miss was the first by a Rangers player across the Europa League and Champions League since Steven Davis in October 2009 (v Unirea Urziceni)."

Yield Spread Sentiment,"The good, the bad and the awkward: US presidents in India",2024-09-14,2020-02-22,By Rajini Vaidyanathan,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-51569605,"US President Donald Trump is expecting a raucous welcome on his first official state visit to India on Monday and Tuesday. He follows a long line of leaders who have made the journey. Some of his predecessors were greeted enthusiastically and one even had a village named after him; others stumbled through diplomatic gaffes. Can history be a guide to how this diplomatic tryst might go? Here's a brief look at past visits- the good, the bad and the awkward. Let's begin at the beginning.  Dwight D Eisenhower, the first US president to visit India, was greeted with a 21-gun salute when he landed in the national capital, Delhi, in December 1959. Huge crowds lined the streets to catch a glimpse of the World War Two hero in his open-top car - Mr Trump is expecting a similar reception in Ahmedabad city, where he will be doing a road show.  The warmth between Eisenhower and Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru helped during what was a rocky phase in US-India ties. This was early in the Cold war, when the US and Pakistan had become become close allies, and India insisted on staying neutral or ""non-aligned"". Like today, relations with China were at the core of the India-US equation, with Washington pressuring Delhi to take an aggressive stance with Beijing on the issue of Tibet.  But, on the whole, Eisenhower's four-day trip was billed a success. And nearly every US president on a state visit to India has emulated his itinerary: he laid flowers at Mahatma Gandhi's memorial, took in the splendour of the Taj Mahal, addressed parliament and spoke at Delhi's iconic Ramlila grounds, which, according to one news report, attracted one million people.  When he left, Nehru said he had taken with him ""a piece of our heart"".  Richard Nixon was no stranger to India when he arrived in August 1969 for a day-long state visit. He had been here as vice-president in 1953, and before that on personal trips but, by all accounts, he wasn't a fan.  ""Nixon disliked Indians in general and despised [Prime Minister] Indira Gandhi,"" according to Gary Bass, author of Blood Telegram: Nixon, Kissinger and a Forgotten Genocide. And, he adds, the feeling was said to be mutual.  This was also at the height of the Cold War, and India's non-alignment policy ""appalled"" American presidents. Bass says that under Gandhi, India's neutrality had turned into a ""noticeably pro-Soviet foreign policy"".  The relationship only turned frostier after the trip as India backed Bangladesh (then East Pakistan) in its fight for independence from Pakistan, a close American ally. The differences were laid bare when Gandhi visited the White House in 1971. Tape recordings - the so-called White House Tapes -  later revealed that Nixon had referred to her as an ""old witch"". Although Jimmy Carter's two-day visit in 1978 marked a thaw in India-US relations, it was not free of hiccups.   With some 500 reporters in tow, Mr Carter followed a packed itinerary: he met Prime Minister Morarji Desai, addressed a joint session of parliament, went to the Taj Mahal, and dropped by a village just outside Delhi.  The village, Chuma Kheragaon, had a personal connection: Mr Carter's mother, Lillian, had visited here when she was in India as a member of the Peace Corps in the late 1960s. So when Mr Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, made the trip, they gave the village money and its first television set. It was even renamed ""Carterpuri"", a moniker it still holds.  But beyond the photo-ops, India and the US were sparring. India was building its nuclear programme, and had conducted its first test in 1974. The US wanted India to sign the NPF, which sought to stop the spread of nuclear weapons. But India refused, saying the agreement discriminated against developing countries.  In a leaked conversation that made headlines and threatened to derail the visit, Mr Carter promised his Secretary of State, Cyrus Vance, a ""very cold and very blunt"" letter to Desai. The two leaders signed a declaration, promising greater global co-operation, but Mr Carter left India without the assurances he had hoped for.  If there was a game-changing visit, it would be Bill Clinton's in March 2000 with Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Mr Clinton's arrival came after a two-decade lull - neither Ronald Reagan nor George Bush Snr made the journey East. It came at a tricky time as Washington had imposed sanctions on Delhi following its 1999 test of a nuclear bomb.  But, according to Navtej Sarna, a former Indian ambassador to the US, the five-day trip was ""a joyous visit"". It included stops in Hyderabad, a southern city that was emerging as a tech hub, and Mumbai, India's financial capital. ""He came and saw the economic and cyber potential of India, and democracy in action,"" says Mr Sarna.  Mr Clinton also danced with villagers, took a tiger safari and sampled Delhi's famously creamy black dal (lentils) at a luxury hotel that has since been associated with the president.  The country's reaction is perhaps best expressed in this New York Times headline: ""Clinton fever - a delighted India has all the symptoms."" George W Bush, as Forbes magazine once put it, was the ""best US president India's ever had"". His three-day visit in March 2006 was a highlight in the two countries' strategic relationship - especially in matters of trade and nuclear technology, subjects they have long wrangled over. His strong personal dynamic with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was hard to miss - after he left office, Mr Bush, a keen artist, even painted a portrait of Mr Singh.  The two leaders are credited for a historic but controversial nuclear deal, which was signed during Mr Bush's visit. It brought India, which had for decades refused to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), out of isolation. Energy-hungry India got access to US civil nuclear technology in exchange for opening its nuclear facilities to inspection.  However, while the visit was substantive, it was not as spectacular as others - there was no trip to the Taj, nor an address to parliament. But the timing was important. Anti-US sentiment over the invasion of Iraq was running high - left-wing MPs had staged a protest against Mr Bush's visit, and there were demonstrations in other parts of India.  Barack Obama was the only president to make two official visits. First, in 2010 with Mr Singh, and then in 2015 with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. On his first visit - in a break from the past - he landed in Mumbai,  instead of Delhi, with a large trade delegation. This was not just about economic ties but a show of solidarity following the Mumbai terror attacks of 2008, which killed 166 people. Mr and Mrs Obama even stayed at the Taj Mahal hotel, one of the main targets.  It was significant that the US president declared support for India to join a reformed and expanded UN Security Council, says Alyssa Ayres, a former US deputy assistant secretary of state for South Asia. ""That all these years later nothing has changed in the UN system is another matter, but that was a major policy shift for the United States."" Mr Obama returned in 2015 as chief guest at India's Republic Day celebrations, at PM Modi's invitation. Trade, defence and climate change were at the heart of the talks. The trip also emphasised an Indo-Pacific strategy, where both leaders expressed unease over Beijing's provocations in the South China Sea. The US and India have certainly had their ups and downs, but during the last official visit in 2015, Mr Obama and Mr Modi signed a declaration of friendship: ""Chalein saath saath [Let's move forward together]..."" it began.  President Trump's visit will take the relationship forward, but it's unclear how.  His arrival in Ahmedabad, the main city in PM Modi's home state of Gujarat, followed by a big arena event, is expected to draw a massive crowd. It will echo Eisenhower's rally in Delhi, perhaps cementing the personal ties between the two leaders.  But while Mr Trump's trip will be packed with pageantry, it could be light on policy. Unlike other presidential visits, this one is not expected to yield many concrete agreements, with the trade deal Mr Trump so badly wants looking unlikely. Follow Rajini on Twitter @BBCRajiniV "
Yield Spread Sentiment,'It was like I blanked out' - Mitchell,2024-09-14,2021-05-14,Phil Dawkes,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/57044631,"Mitchell began his career with Palace, with this his second season with the first team Tyrick Mitchell says it was ""like I blanked out"" after scoring the first goal of his career to give Crystal Palace a comeback victory over Aston Villa in the Premier League. In an engrossing encounter that belied its 'dead rubber' status, both sides contributed energetic displays full of attacking intent, with Mitchell's late goal rewarding Palace for a superb second-half showing. The 21-year-old full-back was in the perfect spot with six minutes left to bundle the ball in with his shoulder following Eberechi Eze's fluffed cross. ""I couldn't tell you what I was thinking in that moment but as soon as it went in, it was just joy,"" said Mitchell, for whom Sunday's game was his 23rd for Palace. ""It was like I blanked out. ""It is definitely a dream come true for me and my whole family. It's been a big season for me personally. Every day was hard but all the work has paid off."" Trailing 2-1 from the 34th minute, Palace battered at the door after the break until the visitors' resistance was finally broken at Selhurst Park. With 15 minutes left, Wilfried Zaha produced a driving run before cutting inside and firing a fierce shot that deflected into the net off Villa defender Ahmed Elmohamady, with Mitchell netting soon after. Palace had already come back into the game once, Christian Benteke heading in against his former club following John McGinn's well-taken opener. Anwar El Ghazi lashed in at the back post to restore Villa's lead - a goal that looked like being the winner until Palace's late rally. Villa remain 11th, four points behind 10th-placed Leeds with two games to play, making a Premier League top-half finish unlikely. Already safe from relegation, the win took Palace to 44 points - with a chance of hitting the 50-point mark for the first time in the Premier League. On a more positive note for Villa and potentially England, Jack Grealish made a second successive appearance from the bench following injury to provide further evidence of his improving fitness before this summer's European Championships. Follow Sunday's Premier League games Premier League predictions: Lawro v 1Xtra DJ Ace This video can not be played Crystal Palace 3-2 Aston Villa: Players burst into applause for Mitchell- Roy Hodgson Palace manager Roy Hodgson said Mitchell received a standing ovation from his team-mates after returning to the changing room. ""It was fitting,"" said Hodgson. ""In the changing room I mentioned him but he was speaking to the media. When he came back the players and staff burst into spontaneous applause and the smile on his face is something that will remain in my mind.  ""It's a day he'll look back on in 15-20 years' time and think 'was I really that good?'"" Mitchell was not the only Palace player who impressed. Before kick-off, Everything's Gonna Be Alright by Bob Marley echoed around the ground and the home team did their best to back up such a sentiment on the field. Sometimes maligned for his style of play, Hodgson has comfortably kept Palace in the Premier League during his four seasons at the club, leaning on a core of experienced and reliable players. With the 73-year-old's contract due to expire this summer along with those of a host of first-team regulars, a clear-out seems likely, but Sunday's performance provides further food for thought. Benteke is one of those whose deal is about to end, although he is arguably in the form of his Palace career, having netted for the third game running and for the fifth time in nine games.  He would have had another but for a superb Emi Martinez save that tipped his header from a corner on to the bar in the second half. Zaha's talents are undoubted and Sunday showed he still has the drive and desire, qualities also on display from Andros Townsend, Cheikhou Kouyate and others. It is perhaps Eze and Mitchell, though, who Palace should be using as the template going forward. Both are young, talented, forward-looking players around which Hodgson - or, more likely, his successor - can build a side. ""In the second half that was the Crystal Palace that I've seen in the last four years - that never-say-die spirit,"" said Hodgson.  ""We accept we'll never roll teams over and we have to work hard to get a result and we did that today. The players deserve an awful amount of credit."" This video can not be played Crystal Palace 3-2 Aston Villa: Dean Smith says his team lacked intensity and quality When Villa beat Palace 3-0 on Boxing Day, they were just outside the top four and pushing for an unexpected European spot. The following five months have provided a big check to such lofty ambitions, but they should not detract from what has been a season of significant progress for a side who narrowly avoided relegation last campaign. Clearly undermined by the absence of star man Grealish for 13 games during which they won only three, Dean Smith's side still pack a punch without the England forward, as they demonstrated on Sunday, especially in a first half that contained their two goals. They could have had more, with Kortney Hause - in for the injured Tyrone Mings - twice heading wide from corners. However, in the second half the absence of Mings and Matty Cash told, as a seemingly tired Villa wilted in the face of the Palace onslaught. They have two games left to finish in the top 10, but, with Tottenham away and Chelsea at home to come, it looks likely Villa will have to settle for the best of the bottom half. ""It certainly hits our hopes,"" said Smith. ""We are four points behind Leeds United and we just have to finish well. ""We looked a really good team in the first half today. We were unfortunate not to go in more than a goal to the good. ""They counter-pressed us better in the second half and we lacked the intensity we had in the first half. They were aggressive and we never really dealt with the ball as well as we did in the first half. ""It became more of a scrappy game and we're frustrated with the goals they did score."" Crystal Palace scored three goals in a Premier League match for the first time since their 5-1 win over West Brom in December, while they did so at Selhurst Park for the first time since a 4-1 win over Leeds in November. Aston Villa have lost four of their past seven league matches when scoring first. Prior to this game, Villa had won 12 of their first 13 league matches this season after scoring first. This was Palace's first Premier League win against a team as many as three places above them in the table since November 2019. There were 42 attempts at goal (23 for Palace, 19 for Aston Villa), with only Manchester United 6-2 Leeds United in December seeing more in a Premier League game this season (43). Palace defender Tyrick Mitchell became the club's youngest top-flight scorer (21y 257d) since Clinton Morrison in 1998 against Sheffield Wednesday (18y 361d). Mitchell is the youngest to score and assist in a Premier League game for Palace since George Ndah in January 1995 against Leicester (20y 22d). Anwar El Ghazi has scored seven away league goals this season, the most by a Villa player since 2012-13, when Christian Benteke scored eight and Gabriel Agbonlahor scored seven on the road. Since the start of the 2012-13 season, only Olivier Giroud (32) has scored more headed Premier League goals than Benteke, whose 31 is the joint-ninth most in Premier League history, level with Tim Cahill. Palace winger Wilfried Zaha scored his 11th league goal of the season, his best in a top-flight campaign. Palace host Arsenal on Wednesday (19:00 BST) before a final-day visit to Anfield to face Liverpool. Tottenham are the visitors to Villa Park on Wednesday (18:00), with Smith's team facing Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Sunday.

Yield Spread Sentiment,The Last of Us is a 'remarkable' show,2024-09-14,2023-01-10,Stephen Kelly,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20230109-the-last-of-us-review-the-best-video-game-adaptation-ever,"Based on the mega-hit PlayStation game, about a man and a teenage girl travelling through the US during a zombie apocalypse, this HBO show starring Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey is a remarkable achievement, writes Stephen Kelly. Live-action video game adaptations are hardly renowned for being serious works of art. At best, the last decade has produced well-crafted family fare, such as Sonic the Hedgehog and Detective Pikachu; at worst, the genre has found itself defined by a string of cynical mediocrities and unwatchable failures. The challenge tends to be two-fold. Video games themselves – while capable of telling compelling stories on their own terms – do not translate naturally to movies and TV shows; while the people in charge of financing or making those movies and TV shows have been known to have little respect for what makes them worth adapting in the first place. Neither of which is the case for HBO's remarkable nine-part adaptation of The Last of Us, generally regarded as one of the greatest video game stories ever told.     More like this:  – 11 TV shows to watch this January – How the apocalypse is being reimagined – The most controversial show of 2022 Originally released in 2013, The Last of Us is set amidst the ravages of a post-apocalyptic US, 20 years after a parasitic fungus called Cordyceps has turned most of the population into mindless monsters. It follows a hardened smuggler named Joel, played in the show by Pedro Pascal, who has been tasked with escorting across the country Ellie (Bella Ramsey), a teenage girl with an apparent rare immunity to the infection. In an interview with The New Yorker, creator Neil Druckmann recalled how, in 2014, a film adaptation fell through because executives wanted to make it bigger and ""sexier"", like the Brad Pitt film World War Z. The game, however, offers a more intimate story. It is a character study of astonishing depth, offering around 15 hours of gameplay. It burns dark, violent, slow; thick with an atmosphere of melancholy and dread; heavily influenced by the aesthetics of prestige television and cinema. Druckmann himself has referenced the Coen Brothers film No Country for Old Men as a touchstone.  It is an essence that has been captured deftly in this small-screen iteration by both Druckmann and co-showrunner Craig Mazin, the writer behind the similarly dark and atmospheric 2019 HBO drama Chernobyl. It is a faithful adaptation in everything from look to score to feel, with the early episodes in particular following the game almost beat-for-beat. We meet loving father Joel on the day of the outbreak, as he desperately tries to keep his daughter Sarah (Nico Parker) safe from a chaotic, crumbling Texas. The infected are fast and rabid at first, but cut to 20 years later and the Cordyceps has spread from the brain to all over the body, creating an array of monstrosities. The most terrifying of which are Clickers, whose fungi-covered eyes mean that they possess super-sensitive hearing. The way they screech, the way they jerk, the way they force you to stay absolutely still, is a horror to behold. It is around this time that we're reintroduced to an older, more grizzled Joel, changed by the things he has had to do to survive. He works as a smuggler (food, ammunition, drugs) in a Quarantine Zone in Boston, where life is tough, resources are scarce and the remnants of the government – now run by FEDRA (Federal Disaster Response Agency), heavily based on real US government agency FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency) – rule with an iron fist. Pascal is not as rugged as video game Joel, but his performance is raw and haunted. He is a man hollowed out by grief, who has buried his humanity and cheer beneath mounds of cynicism and violence. But Pascal is also a sensitive, soulful actor, and seeing Joel soften and thaw throughout the series is one of its great pleasures. The reason for this change is Ellie, who Joel must deliver to a group called the Fireflies – a revolutionary militia fighting to bring down FEDRA and restore democracy – in the hope that they can use her immunity to develop a vaccine. The show essentially lives or dies on the casting of Ellie, who is as playful and profane as she is endearingly obnoxious. Thankfully Bella Ramsey, best known for her brief turn as Lyanna Mormont in Game of Thrones, steals every scene she is in. Her Ellie is a loveable little terror, full of charisma and bravado, serving as the perfect foil to Pascal's stoicism. There's a real wit and warmth to the writing too, as Ellie gradually breaks down Joel’s defences with her favourite book of bad puns. ""Can I ask you a serious question?"" she whispers in the dark, as both of them try to sleep in the woods, ""why did the scarecrow get an award?""   The humour is much needed in the bleak, violent world that they traverse, where people are just as dangerous as the infected. The video game, which is split into four seasons across a year, is episodic in nature, with most locations featuring a sub-plot sketched out in letters and mementos that the player finds. The show builds upon these letters and fleshes them out into fully-formed stories. And it is here, when Druckmann and Mazin are at their most audacious in terms of creative licence, that The Last of Us truly sings as television. Episode three, for example, turns a series of bitter letters between two men called Bill and Frank (implied to be lovers) into the most tender of romances. Set across two decades, it follows paranoid prepper Bill (Nick Offerman) as he strikes up a relationship with Frank (The White Lotus' Murray Bartlett), a man who stumbles into one of his many traps. What follows is a beautiful, exquisitely performed exploration of The Last of Us' central theme: that the ashes of the world are enough, as long as there is someone to live for amongst them. It is a sentiment that is turned inside-out in episodes four and five, which follow Joel and Ellie as they make their way through the aftermath of a bloody uprising against an especially fascistic branch of FEDRA in Kansas City. The superb Melanie Lynskey (Yellowjackets) features here as the chillingly violent and vengeful leader of the revolution. She wants all collaborators executed, with a special emphasis on a man called Henry (Lamar Johnson), who murdered her brother. These episodes also feature some of the show's best action sequences, including a huge set-piece involving the infected that is as grisly and gripping as any in the game. It is not a perfect adaptation. There are certain scenes early on that feel too gamey for television (such as those where Joel and Ellie are sneaking around a museum), while the latter half of the series feels like it needs one more episode to even out the pace (scenes involving the infected are strangely scarce beyond episode five). There is also the fact that no on-screen adaptation of The Last of Us will ever truly capture what makes the source material so interesting: to be immersed in that world, to luxuriate in spaces that feel haunted by absence, to be eaten alive by a Clicker. And yet, it doesn't feel even remotely controversial to call this the best video game adaptation ever made. For fans of the game, it is an adaptation of the utmost skill and reverence, yet one still capable of surprise; for people who have never picked up a controller, it is an encapsulation of the game's heart and soul – its full-blooded characters, its neat plotting, its mature themes of love and loss. It is, to finish Ellie's joke, ""outstanding in its field"". ★★★★☆ The Last of Us premieres on 15 January on HBO in the US and 16 January on Sky Atlantic and NOW in the UK Love film and TV?

Yield Spread Sentiment,The sandwich that feeds the US South,2024-09-14,2020-11-03,Simon Urwin,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20200701-pig-ear-sandwich-an-iconic-dish-of-the-american-south,"This soul-food delicacy that was once about struggle and survival has been transformed into a thing of comfort. Today, we're celebrating a side of the US that few people know by republishing one of our favourite stories about an iconic Southern dish that was invented by accident.  “The ears give you lots of juiciness and tasty pork flavours all at the same time,” said cook Lavette Mack as she stirred a simmering pot on the stovetop. “Add a little crunch with some slaw, give it a kick with some homemade hot sauce, put it all together in a bun and you’ve got yourself something really special."" It’s mid-morning and there’s already a small queue forming at the counter of the Big Apple Inn, a much-loved soul food joint in the Farish Street neighbourhood of Jackson, Mississippi. “I’ll take six please,” said one customer in the colourful twang of the Deep South. “Give me two to have in, honey,” said another. Mack, who’s been working in the kitchen for more than 20 years, duly slices, spreads and stacks fresh batches of what’s become the most famous dish on the Big Apple’s menu: their pig ear sandwich. “For some folk, they may be a novelty, a curiosity,” said Geno Lee, the current owner and great-grandson of the restaurant’s original founder. “But pigs’ ears are an important part of African American cuisine. They’re what we call peasant food; a part of the animal that historically even the poorest could afford. And that’s something the Inn has always stood for since it opened. Making sure everyone gets fed.” The Big Apple story begins almost 100 years ago when Lee’s great-grandfather, Juan “Big John” Mora first arrived in Mississippi from Mexico in the early 1930s. “He jumped off the train in Jackson and stayed. He was never legal here,” said Lee. “Like many immigrants he got to work straight away, seeing how he could turn a dime.” Big John built his own food cart, and using an old family recipe, began making and peddling hot tamales on street corners. By 1939 he’d saved enough money to purchase an old grocery store that he set about transforming into a restaurant. “First he had to decide what to call it,” said Lee. “Around that time there was a dance craze sweeping the nation with lots of different moves like the ‘rusty dusty’ and the ‘pose and peck’. The dance was called The Big Apple and it was his absolute favourite. That’s how the place got its name.” You may also be interested in: • A forgotten food of the American South • The sinking islands of the Southern US • New Orleans’ secret hangover cure Next on Big John’s to-do list was finalising the bill of fare. He added his tamales to the shop’s existing offering of bologna – both are still on the menu to this day – but the Inn’s most iconic dish came about purely by accident. “One day the butcher swung by and offered him some pigs’ ears for free. He snapped them up but had no idea what to do with them. That’s because when they’re fresh and raw, they’re big and tough. Come, I’ll show you.” Lee led me to a back room and retrieved a slab of pink flesh the size of a bread-and-butter plate from a cold box. “At first Big John tried deep-frying them but couldn’t get them tender enough. Then he tried throwing them under the grill; same problem. Finally, he discovered that if he boiled them for two whole days, they’d eventually be good enough to eat.” He gestured to a pair of pressure cookers that rattled and hissed on top of a roaring gas flame nearby. “Thanks to these it now only takes us two hours to do the same thing.” Lee then picked up a carving knife and cut an ear into three. “Each part is the perfect size to make a sandwich”, he said. “That was actually Big John’s invention. At that time, most people just ate the ears boiled but he decided to serve them in a bun. He also added the slaw, a splash of vinegar mustard diluted with water, and being of Mexican origin, it was also his idea to throw chillies in a pot and make a hot sauce.” We walked back into the dining area, which was fast swelling with regulars as lunch hour approached. Lee invited me to sit and sample a “smoke and ears”: one pig ear sandwich alongside another filled with the ground, grilled meat from a Red Rose, a local smoked sausage. A friendly diner looked over to my table and nodded his approval as a plate arrived with two freshly filled brioche buns. “I like to alternate – one bite of ear, one of smoke,” he said by way of recommendation. I followed his advice. The pig ear was glutinous, like a cooked lasagne sheet, with crunchier cartilage in the centre. It tasted like sweet bacon; the pork flavours followed by the after-punch of spicy chillies. The smoke had a deeper, richer tang from the beef hearts in the sausage and the char from the grill. Noting my enthusiastic response to the meal, the diner went on to introduce himself as Carlos Laverne White. He told me that he’d been coming to the Inn for more than 50 years. “In all that time, the price has only gone up a penny or two every year. For those of us with little or no money, it means we can still eat,” he said. “I come once a week, when I can afford to pay the dollar and sixty cents. A smoke and ears fills me right up.” An elderly gentleman in farm overalls settled opposite on the vivid, tangerine-coloured seating. Also a long-time customer, he told me he could remember a saying that went: “This is the place that made you glad that you were hungry.” “That sentiment still applies to this day,” he told me with a broad smile. We chatted awhile and I asked him what makes eating at the Inn so special. He studied his pig ear sandwich while he pondered the reply. “Well, you know something? All the unwanted bits of the pig – the feet, the tail, the chitterlings (intestines) and the ears – back in the day, it was what the slave owners used to give to the enslaved for their weekly rations. It’s a wonderful thing that what was once about struggle and survival has been turned over time into a thing of comfort. Soul food. It’s simple, but it’s delicious.” After the lunchtime rush had passed, I headed back outside with Lee onto Farish Street – at one time Jackson’s equivalent of Memphis’ Beale Street or New Orleans’ Bourbon Street; a wildly popular place full of African American juke joints, movie theatres and nightclubs. “The Big Apple sat at the very heart of the action,” he said. “It was packed day and night. Not only with partygoers, but activists of the Civil Rights Movement.” He pointed to an upstairs window, now missing various panes of glass. “That used to be the office of Medgar Evers, the field secretary for the NAACP (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People).” “The NAACP didn’t have much space for all their supporters, so they’d meet in the Inn and discuss their strategy for bringing an end to racial segregation. Even in those turbulent times it was a place where everyone felt safe. My grandfather was running the Inn at the time. He was mixed race – a black Latino – and an avid supporter of the movement. Anyone that got arrested, he bailed them out of jail. He took them home, gave them a meal and fresh clothes so they could get back out there and fight for justice.” Looking up and down Farish Street, it was hard to imagine the crowds who came here to hear Evers speak, or arrived in their finery to dance the night away. In the late 60s and early 70s, businesses slowly began moving out, and now the neighbourhood is largely derelict, full of crumbling and abandoned buildings. I asked Lee why he chose to stay on and keep the business going. “I originally studied for the priesthood then changed my mind, but the idea of ministry still appealed to me,” he replied. “I decided to become dedicated to the people of Farish Street. Selling pig ear sandwiches might not make me rich, but I leave the Big Apple Inn each night knowing that I’ve done some good, kept an important tradition alive and made sure that no-one goes home hungry. We’ve done just that throughout the pandemic in fact – staying open for take-out as we’re deemed a vital community service.” “But, that’s not all that fills me with pride,” he added. “We now have lots of copycats in the state of Mississippi, even as far away as Memphis, Tennessee. They serve the exact same sandwich and some of them even say about their offering: ‘pig ear sandwich – just like you find on Farish Street’. So the legacy of Big John lives on and has even spread far and wide. That gives me the greatest satisfaction you could possibly imagine.” Join more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.

Yield Spread Sentiment,The library that created modern maths,2024-09-14,2020-12-07,Adrienne Bernhard,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20201204-lost-islamic-library-maths,"Centuries ago, a prestigious Islamic library brought Arabic numerals to the world. Though the library long since disappeared, its mathematical revolution changed our world. The House of Wisdom sounds a bit like make believe: no trace remains of this ancient library, destroyed in the 13th Century, so we cannot be sure exactly where it was located or what it looked like. But this prestigious academy was in fact a major intellectual powerhouse in Baghdad during the Islamic Golden Age, and the birthplace of our modern-day “Arabic” numerals as well as helping to spread transformative concepts such as ""zero"". (The first record of a zero appearing written down was in ancient Mesopotamia to denote nothingness, but it not given meaning until its use in India in the fifth Century from where it eventually spread into the Arab world – although the Mayans are thought to have been using zero several centuries before that.) Founded as a private collection for caliph Harun Al-Rashid in the late 8th Century then converted to a public academy some 30 years later, the House of Wisdom appears to have pulled scientists from all over the world towards Baghdad, drawn as they were by the city’s vibrant intellectual curiosity and freedom of expression (Muslim, Jewish and Christian scholars were all allowed to study there).   An archive as formidable in size as the present-day British Library in London or the Bibliothèque Nationale of Paris, the House of Wisdom eventually became an unrivalled centre for the study of humanities and sciences, including mathematics, astronomy, medicine, chemistry, geography, philosophy, literature and the arts – as well as some more dubious subjects such as alchemy and astrology.   You might also like:   To conjure this great monument thus requires a leap of imagination (think the Citadel in Westeros, or the library at Hogwarts), but one thing is certain: the academy ushered in a cultural Renaissance that would entirely alter the course of mathematics. The House of Wisdom was destroyed in the Mongol Siege of Baghdad in 1258 (according to legend, so many manuscripts were tossed into the River Tigris that its waters turned black from ink), but the discoveries made there introduced a powerful, abstract mathematical language that would later be adopted by the Islamic empire, Europe, and ultimately, the entire world.   ***** “What should matter to us is not the precise details of where or when the House of Wisdom was created,” says Jim Al-Khalili, a professor of physics at the University of Surrey. “Far more interesting is the history of the scientific ideas themselves, and how they developed as a result of it.” Tracing the House of Wisdom’s mathematical legacy involves a bit of time travel back to the future, as it were. For hundreds of years until the ebb of the Italian Renaissance, one name was synonymous with mathematics in Europe: Leonardo da Pisa, known posthumously as Fibonacci. Born in Pisa in 1170, the Italian mathematician received his primary instruction in Bugia, a trading enclave located on the Barbary coast of Africa (coastal North Africa). In his early 20s, Fibonacci traveled to the Middle East, captivated by ideas that had come west from India through Persia. When he returned to Italy, Fibonacci published Liber Abbaci, one of the first Western works to describe the Hindu-Arabic numeric system. When Liber Abbaci first appeared in 1202, Hindu-Arabic numerals were known to only a few intellectuals; European tradesmen and scholars were still clinging to Roman numerals, which made multiplication and division extremely cumbersome (try multiplying MXCI by LVII!). Fibonacci’s book demonstrated numerals’ use in arithmetic operations – techniques which could be applied to practical problems like profit margin, money changing, weight conversion, barter and interest.    “Those who wish to know the art of calculating, its subtleties and ingenuities, must know computing with hand figures,” Fibonacci wrote in the first chapter of his encyclopedic work, referring to the digits that children now learn in school. “With these nine figures and the sign 0, called zephyr, any number whatsoever is written.” Suddenly, mathematics was available to all in a useable form. Fibonacci’s great genius was not just his creativity as a mathematician, however, but his keen understanding of the advantages known to Muslim scientists for centuries: their calculating formulas, their decimal place system, their algebra. In fact, Liber Abbaci relied almost exclusively on the algorithms of 9th-Century mathematician Al-Khwarizmi. His revolutionary treatise presented, for the first time, a systematic way of solving quadratic equations. Because of his discoveries in the field, Al-Khwarizmi is often referred to as the father of algebra – a word we owe to him, from the Arabic al-jabr, “the restoring of broken parts”—and in 821 he was appointed astronomer and head librarian of the House of Wisdom. Al-Khwarizmi’s treatise introduced the Muslim world to the decimal number system,” explains Al-Khalili. “Others, such as Leonardo da Pisa, helped transmit it across Europe.” Fibonacci’s transformative influence on modern maths was thus a legacy owed in great part to Al-Khwarizmi. And so two men separated by nearly four centuries were connected by an ancient library: the most celebrated mathematician of the Middle Ages stood on the shoulder of another pioneering thinker, one whose breakthroughs were made at an iconic institution of the Islamic Golden Age. Perhaps because so little is known about the House of Wisdom, historians are occasionally tempted to exaggerate its scope and purpose, giving it an mythic status somewhat at odds with the scant historical records left to us. “Some argue that the House of Wisdom was nothing like as grand as it became in the eyes of many,” says Al-Khalili. “But its association with men such as Al-Khwarizmi, with his work in mathematics, astronomy and geography, is for me strong evidence that the House of Wisdom was closer to a true academy, not just a repository of translated books.” Scholars and translators at the library also took great pains to ensure that their work was accessible to the reading public. “The House of Wisdom is fundamentally important, as it’s through translations there – Arabic scholars who translated Greek ideas into the vernacular – that we formed the bedrock of our mathematical understanding” says June Barrow-Green, professor of history of mathematics at the Open University in the UK. The palace library was as much a window into numerical ideas from the past as it was a site of scientific innovation. Long before our current decimal system, the binary number system that programs our computers, before Roman numerals, before the system used by ancient Mesopotamians, humans were using early tally systems to record calculations. While we might find each of these imponderable or antiquated, differing numerical representations can actually teach us something valuable about structure, relationships, and the historical and cultural contexts from which they emerged. They reinforce the idea of place value and abstraction, helping us to better understand how numbers work. They show that “the Western way wasn’t the only way”, says Barrow-Green. “There is a real value in understanding different numbers systems.” When an ancient trader wanted to write “two sheep”, for example, she could inscribe in clay a picture of two sheep. But this would be impractical if she wanted to write “20 sheep.” Sign-value notation is a system in which numeric symbols add together signify a value; in this case, drawing two sheep to represent the actual quantity. A vestige of sign-value notation, Roman numerals somehow persisted despite the introduction of Al-Khwarizmi’s system, which relied on the position of digits to represent quantities. Like the towering monuments on which they were inscribed, Roman numerals outlived the empire that gave birth to them – whether by accident, sentiment or purpose, none can say for sure. This year marks the 850th anniversary of Fibonacci’s birth. It could also be the moment which threatens to undo the journeywork of Roman numerals. In the UK, traditional time-pieces have been replaced with easier-to-read digital clocks in school classrooms, for fear students can no longer tell analogue time properly. In some regions of the world, governments have dropped them from road signs and official documents, while Hollywood has moved away from using Roman numerals in sequel titles. The Superbowl famously ditched them for its 50th game, worried it was confusing fans. But a global shift away from Roman numerals underscores a creeping innumeracy in other aspects of life. Perhaps more important, the disappearance of Roman numerals reveals the politics that govern any wider discussion about mathematics. “The question of whose stories we tell, whose culture we privilege, and which forms of knowledge we immortalise into formal learning are inevitably influenced by our Western colonial heritage” says Lucy Rycroft-Smith, editor and developer at Cambridge Mathematics. A former maths teacher, Rycroft-Smith is now a leading voice in mathematics education, and studies differences across global curricula. While Wales, Scotland and Ireland do not include Roman numerals in their learning objectives, and the US has no standard requirements, England explicitly states that students must be able to read Roman numerals up to 100. Many of us will find nothing special about the figure MMXX (that’s 2020, if you’re unaware). We may dimly recognise Fibonacci for the famous pattern named after him: a recursive sequence that starts with 1 and is thereafter the sum of the two previous numbers. The Fibonacci sequence is certainly remarkable, showing up with astonishing frequency in the natural world – in seashells and plant tendrils, in the spirals of sunflower heads, in pine cones, animal horns and the arrangement of leaf buds on a stem, as well as the digital realm (in computer science and sequencing). His patterns often make their way into popular culture, too: in literature, film and visual arts; as a refrain in song lyrics or orchestral scores; even in architecture.   But Leonardo da Pisa’s most enduring mathematical contribution is something rarely taught in schools. That story begins in a palace library nearly a thousand years ago, at a time when most of Western Christendom lay in intellectual darkness. It is a tale that should dismantle our Eurocentric view of mathematics, shine a spotlight on the Islamic world’s scientific achievements and argue for the continued importance of numerical treasures from long ago.   (An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated Al Khawrazmi was an Arab; he was Persian. It also stated that the House of Wisdom was the birthplace of the concept of ""zero"", but it had in fact been used in ancient Mayan culture and in India, from where it spread to the Arab world.) --   Join one million Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.

Yield Spread Sentiment,Markets drop as tech slowdown fears grow,2024-09-14,2018-11-20,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46272632,"A sell-off on Wall Street continued on Tuesday, amid steep declines in oil prices and losses among technology shares. The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 550 points to close 2.2% lower, weighed down by Apple, whose share price plunged by nearly 5%. The broader S&P 500 dropped 1.8%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq index fell 1.7% to its lowest level since February. Meanwhile, benchmark oil prices sank nearly 7%, close to one-year lows. Connor Campbell at Spreadex described the sell-off as a ""macro-car crash, with Brexit fears, the post-Apec pre-G20 US-China trade war flare-up and the continuation of a nasty US tech sell-off resulting in absolute carnage"". It also reflects underlying concerns about slowing global growth, according to Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS Markit. In the US, a robust economy had so far largely shielded stock markets from some of those worries. However, Mr Behravesh said investors now expect a boost from tax cuts and increased government spending to fade. ""This stimulus will wear off by late 2019 and early 2020, and the US economy will join the others in seeing a significant loss of speed,"" he said.  US retailers were punished for weak results and forecasts, with shares in Target sinking 10%, while Kohl's tumbled 9% and Walmart was dragged almost 3% lower. Analysts at Goldman Sachs cut their price target for Apple shares from $209 to $182, blaming very weak demand from China in the late summer as well as a stronger US dollar. Michael O'Rouke at Jonestrading said retailers as well as big technology firms such as Amazon and Facebook had pushed the market higher for most of this year.  ""Now that's fading, so people are more apt to take profit and de-risk going into the year-end. There are the headwinds of the trade war out there. The fiscal stimulus from tax cuts is starting to fade ... we don't have many positive catalysts,"" he said. By Michelle Fleury, New York business correspondent  The balloons will soon be inflated for the Thanksgiving Day parade just as the air seems to be coming out of the US markets. Tuesday's sell-off seemed to be sparked by disappointing earnings from several retailers. Aside from that, Wall Street traders offered up several reasons for the recent volatility. One was President Trump's trade war with China. Any escalation could hurt US and Chinese companies by raising production costs and the price for consumers. Another was the prospect that America's central bank could raise interest rates to combat inflation and stop the economy from overheating. This makes it more expensive for companies to borrow and invest. Whatever is behind the latest stock market gyrations, it's worth remembering that the current bull market is the oldest in history.  For months some have warned that the US market is overvalued. In which case what you may be witnessing is a shift as investors move from chasing yield - financial jargon for the return on their investment - to managing risk. The US market falls extended declines in Europe. In London, the FTSE 100 index slipped back below 7,000 points. The DAX index in Frankfurt fell 1.5%, while in Paris, the CAC 40 was 1.2% lower.  IHS Markit said the market swings are starting to hurt business sentiment and capital spending. But analysts at Oxford Economics said they think the effect on consumer spending - the biggest economic driver in the US - is likely to be relatively muted. The firm wrote: ""This doesn't mean the economy is insulated from stock market movements, but rather that so long as those movements don't excessively weigh on confidence, employment and income, consumers can be expected to continue spending.""  Since market turmoil emerged in earnest in October, all three major US indexes have largely given up the gains made earlier in 2018. Oil prices for the major benchmarks are also down about 30% since last month. On Tuesday, Brent crude fell by 6.5% to $62.58 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate shed 6.8% to $53.41 a barrel.  Hans Redeker at Morgan Stanley commented: ""For the US equity market to stabilise, either the rest of the world will have to show better growth or the Fed will have to moderate its stance."""
Yield Spread Sentiment,The rise and fall of 'Islamic State',2024-09-14,2016-03-09,Jim Muir,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-35695648,"Abu Anis only realised something unusual was happening when he heard the sound of explosions coming from the old city on the western bank of the Tigris as it runs through Mosul.  ""I phoned some friends over there, and they said armed groups had taken over, some of them foreign, some Iraqis,"" the computer technician said. ""The gunmen told them, 'We've come to get rid of the Iraqi army, and to help you.'"" The following day, the attackers crossed the river and took the other half of the city. The Iraqi army and police, who vastly outnumbered their assailants, broke and fled, officers first, many of the soldiers stripping off their uniforms as they joined a flood of  panicked civilians.  This video can not be played Video footage from Mosul after its capture by Isis shows militants driving through the streets It was 10 June 2014, and Iraq's second biggest city, with a population of around two million, had just fallen to the militants of the group then calling itself Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham/the Levant (Isis or Isil).  Four days earlier, black banners streaming, a few hundred of the Sunni militants had crossed the desert border in a cavalcade from their bases in eastern Syria and met little resistance as they moved towards their biggest prize. Rich dividends were immediate. The Iraqi army, rebuilt, trained and equipped by the Americans since the US-led invasion of 2003, abandoned large quantities of armoured vehicles and advanced weaponry, eagerly seized by the militants. They also reportedly grabbed something like $500m from the Central Bank's Mosul branch. ""At the beginning, they behaved well,"" said Abu Anis. ""They took down all the barricades the army had put up between quarters. People liked that. On their checkpoints they were friendly and helpful - 'Anything you need, we're here for you.'"" The Mosul honeymoon was to last a few weeks. But just down the road, terrible things were already happening.  As the Iraqi army collapsed throughout the north, the militants moved swiftly down the Tigris river valley. Towns and villages fell like skittles. Within a day they had captured the town of Baiji and its huge oil refinery, and moved on swiftly to seize Saddam Hussein's old hometown, Tikrit, a Sunni hotbed. Just outside Tikrit is a big military base, taken over by the Americans in 2003 and renamed Camp Speicher after the first US casualty in the 1991 ""Desert Storm"" Gulf war against Iraq, a pilot called Scott Speicher, shot down over al-Anbar province in the west.  Bodies being exhumed at Camp Speicher, 2015 Camp Speicher, by now full of Iraqi military recruits, was surrounded by the Isis militants and surrendered. The thousands of captives were sorted, the Shia were weeded out, bound, and trucked away to be systematically shot dead in prepared trenches. Around 1,700 are believed to have been massacred in cold blood. The mass graves are still being exhumed.  Far from trying to cover up the atrocity, Isis revelled in it, posting on the internet videos and pictures showing the Shia prisoners being taken away and shot by the black-clad militants.  In terms of exultant cruelty and brutality, worse was not long in coming.  After a pause of just two months, Isis - now rebranded as ""Islamic State"" (IS) - erupted again, taking over large areas of northern Iraq controlled by the Kurds.  That included the town of Sinjar, mainly populated by the Yazidis, an ancient religious minority regarded by IS as heretics. Yazidi women in Germany protest against IS attacks on their community in northern Iraq, 2014 Hundreds of Yazidi men who failed to escape were simply killed. Women and children were separated and taken away as war booty, to be sold and bartered as chattels, and used as sex slaves. Thousands are still missing, enduring that fate.  Deliberately shocking, bloodthirsty exhibitionism reached a climax towards the end of the same month, August 2014. IS issued a video showing its notorious, London-accented and now late executioner Mohammed Emwazi (sardonically nicknamed ""Jihadi John"" by former captives) gruesomely beheading American journalist James Foley.  In the following weeks, more American and British journalists and aid workers - Steven Sotloff, David Haines, Alan Henning, and Peter Kassig (who had converted to Islam and changed his name to Abdul Rahman) - appeared being slaughtered in similar, slickly produced videos, replete with propaganda statements and dire warnings.  Murdered Western hostages: (From top left clockwise) Steven Sotloff, David Haines, James Foley, Alan Henning, Abdul Rahman (Peter) Kassig In the space of a few months, IS had blasted its way from obscurity on to the centre of the world stage. Almost overnight, it became a household word. Seven-and-a-half thousand miles (12,000km) away, then Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott summed up the breathtaking novelty of the horror. It was, he said ""medieval barbarism, perpetrated and spread with the most modern of technology"". IS had arrived, and the world was taking notice. But the men in black did not appear out of the blue. They had been a long time coming.  The theology of murder The ideological or religious roots of IS and like-minded groups go deep into history, almost to the beginning of Islam itself in the 7th Century AD. Like Christianity six centuries before it, and Judaism some eight centuries before that, Islam was born into the harsh, tribal world of the Middle East. ""The original texts, the Old Testament and the Koran, reflected primitive tribal Jewish and Arab societies, and the codes they set forth were severe,"" writes the historian and author William Polk. ""They aimed, in the Old Testament, at preserving and enhancing tribal cohesion and power and, in the Koran, at destroying the vestiges of pagan belief and practice. Neither early Judaism nor Islam allowed deviation. Both were authoritarian theocracies."" As history moved on, Islam spread over a vast region, encountering and adjusting to numerous other societies, faiths and cultures. Inevitably in practice it mutated in different ways, often becoming more pragmatic and indulgent, often given second place to the demands of power and politics and temporal rulers. For hardline Muslim traditionalists this amounted to deviationism, and from early on, there was a clash of ideas in which those arguing for a strict return to the ""purity"" of the early days of Islam often paid a price.  The eminent scholar Ahmad ibn Hanbal (780-855), who founded one of the main schools of Sunni Islamic jurisprudence, was jailed and once flogged unconscious in a dispute with the Abbasid caliph in Baghdad.  Nearly five centuries later, another supreme theologian of the same strict orthodox school, Ibn Taymiyya, died in prison in Damascus. These two men are seen as the spiritual forefathers of later thinkers and movements which became known as ""salafist"", advocating a return to the ways of the first Muslim ancestors, the salaf al-salih (righteous ancestors). They inspired a later figure whose thinking and writings were to have a huge and continuing impact on the region and on the salafist movement, one form of which, Wahhabism, took his name.  Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab was born in 1703 in a small village in the Nejd region in the middle of the Arabian peninsula.  A devout Islamic scholar, he espoused and developed the most  puritanical and strict version of what he saw as the original faith, and sought to spread it by entering pacts with the holders of political and military power. In an early foray in that direction, his first action was to destroy the tomb of Zayd ibn al-Khattab, one of the Companions of the Prophet Muhammad, on the grounds that by the austere doctrine of salafist theology, the veneration of tombs constitutes shirk, the revering of something or someone other than Allah.  But it was in 1744 that Abd al-Wahhab made his crucial alliance with the local ruler, Muhammad ibn Saud. It was a pact whereby Wahhabism provided the spiritual or ideological dimension for Saudi political and military expansion, to the benefit of both. Passing through several mutations, that dual alliance took over most of the peninsula and has endured to this day, with the House of Saud ruling in sometimes uneasy concert with an ultra-conservative Wahhabi religious establishment.  The entrenchment of Wahhabi salafism in Saudi Arabia - and the billions of petrodollars to which it gained access - provided one of the wellsprings for jihadist militancy in the region in modern times.   Jihad  means struggle on the path of Allah, which can mean many kinds of personal struggle, but more often is taken to mean waging holy war. But the man most widely credited, or blamed, for bringing salafism into the 20th Century was the Egyptian thinker Sayyid Qutb. He provided a direct bridge from the thought and heritage of Abd al-Wahhab and his predecessors to a new generation of jihadist militants, leading up to al-Qaeda and all that was to follow.  Sayyid Qutb, ""the source of all jihadist thought"" Born in a small village in Upper Egypt in 1906, Sayyid Qutb found himself at odds with the way Islam was being taught and managed around him. Far from converting him to the ways of the West, a two-year study period in the US in the late 1940s left him disgusted at what he judged unbridled godless materialism and debauchery, and his fundamentalist Islamic outlook was honed harder.  Back in Egypt, he developed the view that the West was imposing its control directly or indirectly over the region in the wake of the Ottoman Empire's collapse after World War One, with the collaboration of local rulers who might claim to be Muslims, but who had in fact deviated so far from the right path that they should no longer be considered such.  For Qutb, offensive jihad against both the West and its local agents was the only way for the Muslim world to redeem itself. In essence, this was a kind of takfir - branding another Muslim an apostate or kafir (infidel), making it justified and even obligatory and meritorious to kill him.  Although he was a theorist and intellectual rather than an active jihadist, Qutb was judged dangerously subversive by the Egyptian authorities. He was hanged in 1966 on charges of involvement in a Muslim Brotherhood plot to assassinate the nationalist President, Gamal Abdel Nasser.  Qutb was before his time, but his ideas lived on in the 24 books he wrote, which have been read by tens of millions,  and in the personal contact he had with the circles of people like Ayman al-Zawahiri, another Egyptian who is the current al-Qaeda leader.  Another intimate of the al-Qaeda founder Osama Bin Laden said: ""Qutb was the one who most affected our generation."" He has also been described as ""the source of all jihadist thought"", and ""the philosopher of the Islamic revolution"". 9/11: The attackers were influenced by Qutb's writings More than 35 years after he was hanged, the official commission of inquiry into al-Qaeda's 9/11 attack on the Twin Towers in 2001 concluded: ""Bin Laden shares Qutb's stark view, permitting him and his followers to rationalise even unprovoked mass murder as righteous defence of an embattled faith."" And his influence lingers on today. Summing up the roots of IS and its predecessors, the Iraqi expert on Islamist movements Hisham al-Hashemi said: ""They are founded on two things: a takfiri faith based on the writings of Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, and as methodology, the way of Sayyid Qutb."" The theology of militant jihadism was in place. But to flourish, it needed two things - a battlefield, and strategists to shape the battle. Afghanistan was to provide the opportunity for both.  Rise of al-Qaeda The Soviet invasion in 1979, and the 10 years of occupation that followed, provided a magnet for would-be jihadists from around the Arab world. Some 35,000 of them flocked to Afghanistan during that period, to join the jihad and help the mainly Islamist Afghan mujahideen guerrillas turn the country into Russia's Vietnam. Soviet forces in Afghanistan, 1980 There is little evidence that the ""Afghan Arabs"", as they became known, played a pivotal combat role in driving the Soviets out. But they made a major contribution in setting up support networks in Pakistan, channelling funds from Saudi Arabia and other donors, and funding schools and militant training camps. It was a fantastic opportunity for networking and forging enduring relationships as well as tasting jihad first hand. Ironically, they found themselves on the same team as the Americans. The CIA's Operation Cyclone channelled hundreds of millions of dollars through Pakistan to militant Afghan mujahedeen leaders such as Golbuddin Hekmatyar, who associated closely with the Arab jihadists. It was in Afghanistan that virtually all the major figures in the new jihadist world cut their teeth. They helped shape events there in the aftermath of the Soviet withdrawal in 1989, a period that saw the emergence of al-Qaeda as a vehicle for a wider global jihad, and Afghanistan provided a base for it.  By the time the Taliban took over in 1996, they were virtually in partnership with Osama Bin Laden and his men, and it was from there that al-Qaeda launched its fateful 9/11 attack in 2001. The formative Afghan experience provided both the combat-hardened salafist jihadist leaders and the strategists who were to play an instrumental role in the emergence of the IS of today.  Most significant was the Jordanian jihadist Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, who more than anybody else ended up being the direct parent of IS in almost every way.  Abu Musab al-Zarqawi A high-school dropout whose prison career began with a sentence for drug and sexual offences, Zarqawi found religion after being sent to classes at a mosque in the Jordanian capital, Amman. He arrived in Pakistan to join jihad in Afghanistan just in time to see the Soviets withdraw in 1989, but stayed on to work with jihadists.  After a stint back in Jordan where he received a 15-year jail sentence on terrorist charges but was later released in a general amnesty, Zarqawi finally met Bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri in 1999. By all accounts the two al-Qaeda leaders did not take to him. They found him brash and headstrong, and they did not like the many tattoos from his previous life that he had not been able to erase.  But he was charismatic and dynamic, and although he did not join al-Qaeda, they eventually put him in charge of a training camp in Herat, western Afghanistan. It was here that he worked with an ideologue whose radical writings became the scriptures governing subsequent salafist blood-letting: Abu Abdullah al-Muhajir. ""The brutality of beheading is intended, even delightful to God and His Prophet,"" wrote Muhajir in his book The Theology of Jihad, more generally referred to as the Theology of Bloodshed. His writings provided religious cover for the most brutal excesses, and also for the killing of Shia as infidels, and their Sunni collaborators as apostates. The other book that has been seen as the virtual manual - even the Mein Kampf - for IS and its forebears is The Management of Savagery, by Abu Bakr Naji, which appeared on the internet in 2004.  The Management of Savagery, a virtual manual for jihadists ""We need to massacre and to do just as has been done to Banu Qurayza, so we must adopt a ruthless policy in which hostages are brutally and graphically murdered unless our demands are met,"" Naji wrote. He was  referring to a Jewish tribe in seventh-century Arabia which reportedly met the same fate at the hands of early Muslims as the Yazidis of Sinjar did nearly 14 centuries later: the men were slaughtered, the women and children enslaved.  Naji's sanctioning of exemplary brutality was part of a much wider strategy to prepare the way for an Islamic caliphate. Based partly on the lessons of Afghanistan, his book is a detailed blueprint for provoking the West into interventions which would further rally the Muslims to jihad, leading to the ultimate collapse of the enemy.  The scenario is not so fanciful if you consider that the Soviet Union went to pieces barely two years after its withdrawal from Afghanistan.   Naji is reported to have been killed in a US drone strike in Pakistan's Waziristan province in 2008.  Iraq fiasco The fallout from the 9/11 attacks changed things radically for the jihadists in late 2001. The US and allies bombed and invaded Afghanistan, ousting the Taliban, and launching a wider ""War on Terror"" against al-Qaeda. Bin Laden went underground, and Zarqawi and others fled. The dispersing militants, fired up, badly needed another battlefield on which to provoke and confront their Western enemies.  Luck was on their side. The Americans and their allies were not long in providing it.  Their invasion of Iraq in the spring of 2003 was, it turned out, entirely unjustified on its own chosen grounds - Saddam Hussein's alleged production of weapons of mass destruction, and his supposed support for international terrorists, neither of which was true.  Bombardment of Baghdad before the US-led invasion in 2003 By breaking up every state and security structure and sending thousands of disgruntled Sunni soldiers and officials home, they created precisely the state of ""savagery"", or violent chaos, that Abu Bakr Naji envisaged for the jihadists to thrive in.  Iraq was on the way to becoming what US officials came to call the ""parent tumour"" of the IS presence in the region. Under Saddam's tightly-controlled Baath Party regime, the Sunnis enjoyed pride of place over the majority Shia, who have strong ties with their co-religionists across the border in Iran.  The US-led intervention disempowered the Sunnis, creating massive resentment and providing fertile ground for the outside salafist jihadists to take root in.  They were not long in spotting their constituency. Abu Musab Zarqawi moved in, and within a matter of months was organising deadly, brutal and provocative attacks aimed both at Western targets and at the majority Shia community.  Doctrinal differences between the two sects go back to disputes over the succession to the Prophet Muhammad in the early decades of Islam, but conflict between them is generally based on community, history and sectarian politics rather than religion as such.  Setting himself up with a new group called Tawhid wa al-Jihad (Tawhid means declaring the uniqueness of Allah), Zarqawi immediately forged a pragmatic operational alliance with underground cells of the remnants of Saddam's regime, providing the two main intertwined strands of the Sunni-based insurgency: militant Jihadism, and Iraqi Sunni nationalism with Baathist organisation at its core.  His group claimed responsibility for several deadly attacks in August 2003 that set the pattern for much of what was to come: a suicide truck bomb explosion at the UN headquarters in Baghdad that killed the envoy Sergio Vieira de Mello and 20 of his staff, and a suicide car bomb blast in Najaf which killed the influential Shia ayatollah Muhammad Baqir al-Hakim and 80 of his followers. The bombers were salafist jihadists, but logistics were reportedly provided by underground Baathists.  Zarqawi was behind the deadly 2003 bombing of the UN headquarters in Baghdad The following year, Zarqawi himself was believed by the CIA to be the masked killer shown in a video beheading an American hostage, Nicholas Berg, in revenge for the Abu Ghraib prison abuses of Iraqi detainees by members of the US military.  As the battle with the Americans and the new Shia-dominated Iraqi government intensified, Zarqawi finally took the oath of loyalty to Bin Laden, and his group became the official al-Qaeda branch in Iraq.  But they were never really on the same page. Zarqawi's provocative attacks on Shia mosques and markets, triggering sectarian carnage, and his penchant for publicising graphic brutality, were all in line with the radical teachings he had imbibed. But they drew rebukes from the al-Qaeda leadership, concerned at the impact on Muslim opinion.  Zarqawi paid little heed. His strain of harsh radicalism passed to his successors after he was killed by a US air strike in June 2006 on his hideout north of Baghdad. He was easily identified by the tattoos he had never managed to get rid of.  The direct predecessor of IS emerged just a few months later, with the announcement of the Islamic State in Iraq (ISI) as an umbrella bringing the al-Qaeda branch together with other insurgent factions. But tough times lay ahead. In January 2007, the Americans began ""surging"" their own troops in Iraq from 132,000 to a peak of 168,000, adopting a much more hands-on approach in mentoring the rebuilt Iraqi army. At the same time, they enticed Sunni tribes in western al-Anbar province to stop supporting the jihadists and join the US-led Coalition-Iraqi government drive to quell the insurgency, which many did, on promises that they would be given jobs and control over their own security.  By the time both the new ISI and al-Qaeda leaders were killed in a US-Iraqi army raid on their hideout in April 2010, the insurgency was at its lowest ebb, pushed back into remote corners of Sunni Iraq.  They were both replaced by one man, about whom very little was publicly known at the time, and not much more since: Ibrahim Awad al-Badri, better known by his nom de guerre, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.  Six eventful years later, he would be proclaimed Caliph Ibrahim, Commander of the Faithful and leader of the newly declared ""Islamic State"". Territorial takeover Baghdadi's career is so shrouded in mist that there are very few elements of it that can be regarded as fact. By all accounts he was born near Samarra, north of Baghdad, so the epithet ""Baghdadi"" seems to have been adopted to give him a more national image, while ""Abu Bakr"" evokes the first successor to (and father-in-law of) Prophet Muhammad. Like the original Abu Bakr, Baghdadi is also reputed to come from the Prophet's Quraysh clan. That, and his youth - born in 1971 - may have been factors in his selection as leader.  All accounts of his early life agree that he was a quiet, scholarly and devout student of Islam, taking a doctorate at the Islamic University of Baghdad. Some even say he was shy, and a bit of a loner, living for 10 years in a room beside a small Sunni mosque in western Baghdad.  The word ""charismatic"" has never been attached to him.  29 June 2014: Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi makes a rare appearance in public As a youth, Baghdadi had a passion for Koranic recitation and was meticulous in his observance of religious law. His family nicknamed him The Believer because he would chastise his relatives for failing to live up to his stringent standards. Who is Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi?  What has happened to Baghdadi? But by the time of the US-led invasion in 2003, he appears to have become involved with a militant Sunni group, heading its Sharia (Islamic law) committee. American troops detained him, and he was reportedly held in the detention centre at Camp Bucca in the south for most of 2004.  Camp Bucca (named after a fireman who died in the 9/11 attacks) housed up to 20,000 inmates and became a university from which many IS and other militant leaders graduated. It gave them an unrivalled opportunity to imbibe and spread radical ideologies and sabotage skills and develop important contacts and networks, all in complete safety, under the noses and protection of their enemies.  Baghdadi would also certainly have met in Camp Bucca many of the ex-Baathist military commanders with whom he was to form such a deadly partnership.  The low-profile, self-effacing Baghdadi rang no alarm bells with the Americans. They released him, having decided he was low-risk. Camp Bucca, 2008: A ""university"" for future IS leaders But he went on to work his way steadily up through the insurgent hierarchy, virtually unknown to the Iraqi public. By the time Baghdadi took over in 2010, the curtains seemed to be coming down for the jihadists in the Iraqi field of ""savagery"". But another one miraculously opened up for them across the border in neighbouring Syria at just the right moment. In the spring of 2011, the outbreak of civil war there offered a promising new arena of struggle and expansion. The majority Sunnis were in revolt against the oppressive regime of Bashar al-Assad, dominated by his Alawite minority, an offshoot of Shia Islam.  Baghdadi sent his men in. By December 2011, deadly car bombs were exploding in Damascus which turned out to be the work of the then shadowy al-Nusra Front. It announced itself as an al-Qaeda affiliate the following month. It was headed by a Syrian jihadist, Abu Mohammed al-Jawlani. He had been sent by Baghdadi, but had his own ideas. Jostling with a huge array of competing rebel groups in Syria, al-Nusra won considerable support on the ground because of its fearless and effective fighting skills, and the flow of funds and foreign fighters that support from al-Qaeda stimulated. It was relatively moderate in its salafist approach, and cultivated local relationships. Al-Nusra was slipping out of Baghdadi's control, and he didn't like it. In April 2013, he tried to rein it back, announcing that al-Nusra was under his command in a new Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham (Syria or the Levant). Isis, or Isil, was born. IS flag: Arabic text of the first part of ""shahada"", the basic statement of the Islamic faith, and the seal of the Prophet below it During the short and turbulent period over which it has imposed itself as a major news brand, so-called Islamic State has confused the world with a series of name changes reflecting its mutations and changing aspirations, leaving a situation where there is no universal agreement on how to refer to it. After emerging in Iraq as the Islamic State in Iraq (ISI), its spread to Syria prompted the addition of ""and al-Sham"", a word that can mean Damascus, Syria, or the wider Levant Many chose to use the easy acronym Isis, with the ""S"" standing either for Syria or al-Sham, though the US administration and others opted for Isil (the ""l"" standing for ""Levant""). Both are still widely used though technically outdated In Arabic the same acronym can come out as Daash, sometimes spelled Daesh in English; it has passed into common usage among many Arabs, but is disliked by the organisation itself, which sees it as disrespectful of the ""state""; although Daash has no meaning in Arabic, it also has an unpleasant sound to it, which may be why American and Western officialdom often use it After further expansion of territory and ambitions, the movement dropped geographical specificity and called itself simply ""the Islamic State""; Much of the world was politically reluctant simply to call it that, for fear of implying legitimacy The BBC and others have generally opted for calling it the ""self-styled"" or ""so-called"" Islamic State on first reference, and IS thereafter But Jawlani rebelled, and renewed his oath of loyalty to al-Qaeda's global leadership, now under Ayman al-Zawahiri following Bin Laden's death in 2011. Zawahiri ordered Baghdadi to go back to being just the Islamic State in Iraq (ISI) and leave al-Nusra as the al-Qaeda Syria franchise.  It was Baghdadi's turn to ignore orders from head office. Before 2013 was out, Isis and al-Nusra were at each other's throats. Hundreds were killed in vicious internecine clashes which ended with Isis being driven out of most of north-west Syria by al-Nusra and allied Syrian rebel factions. But Isis took over Raqqa, a provincial capital in the north-east, and made it its capital. Many of the foreign jihadists who had joined al-Nusra also went over to Isis, seeing it as tougher and more radical. In early 2014, al-Qaeda formally disowned Isis.  Isis had shaken off the parental shackles. But it had lost a lot of ground, and was bottled up. One of its main slogans, Remaining and Expanding, risked becoming empty. So where next? Fortune smiled once more. Back in Iraq, conditions had again become ripe for the jihadists. The Americans had gone, since the end of 2011. Sunni areas were again aflame and in revolt, enraged by the sectarian policies of the Shia Prime Minister, Nouri Maliki. Sunnis felt marginalised, oppressed and angry.  An IS fighter waves a flag while standing on a captured government fighter jet in Raqqa, Syria, 2015 When Isis decided to move, it was pushing at an open door. In fact, it had never really left Iraq, just gone into the woodwork. As it swept through Sunni towns, cities and villages with bewildering speed in June 2014, sleeper cells of salafist jihadists and ex-Saddamist militants and other sympathisers broke cover and joined the takeover.  With the capture of Mosul, Isis morphed swiftly into a new mode of being, like a rocket jettisoning its carrier. No longer just a shadowy terrorist group, it was suddenly a jihadist army holding large stretches of territory, ruling millions of people, and not only threatening the Iraqi state, but challenging the entire world. The change was signalled on 29 June by the proclamation of the ""Islamic State"", replacing all previous incarnations, and the establishment of the ""caliphate"". A few days later, the newly anointed Caliph Ibrahim, aka Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, made a surprise appearance in Mosul in the pulpit of the historic Grand Mosque of al-Nuri, heavily laden with anti-Crusader associations. He called on the world's Muslims to rally behind him.  By declaring a caliphate and adopting the generic ""Islamic State"" title, the organisation was clearly setting its sights far beyond Syria and Iraq. It was going global.  Announcing a caliphate has huge significance and resonance within Islam. While it remains the ideal, Bin Laden and other al-Qaeda leaders had always shied away from it, for fear of failure. Now Baghdadi was trumping the parent organisation, setting IS up in direct competition with it for the leadership of global jihadism.  A caliphate (khilafa) is the rule or rein of a caliph (khalifa), a word which simply means a successor - primarily of the Prophet Muhammad. Under the first four caliphs who followed after he died in 632, the Islamic Caliphate burst out of Arabia and extended through modern-day Iran to the east, into Libya to the west, and to the Caucasus in the north.  The Umayyad caliphate which followed, based in Damascus, took over almost all of the lands that IS would like to control, including Spain. The Baghdad-based Abbasid caliphate took over in 750 and saw a flowering of science and culture, but found it hard to hold it all together, and Baghdad was sacked by the Mongols in 1258. Emerging from that, the Ottoman Empire, based in Constantinople (Istanbul), stretched almost to Vienna at its peak, and was also a caliphate, though the distinction with empire was often blurred. The caliphate was finally abolished by Ataturk in 1924.  So when Baghdadi was declared Caliph of the Islamic State, it was an act of extraordinary ambition. He was claiming no less than the mantle of the Prophet, and of his followers who carried Islam into vast new realms of conquest and expansion.  For most Islamic scholars and authorities, not to mention Arab and Muslim leaders, such claims from the chief of one violent extremist faction had no legitimacy at all, and there was no great rush to embrace the new caliphate. But the millennial echoes it evoked did strike a chord with some Islamic romantics - and with some like-minded radical groups abroad.  Four months after the proclamation, a group of militants in Libya became the first to join up by pledging allegiance to Baghdadi, followed a month later by the Ansar Beit al-Maqdis jihadist faction in Egypt's Sinai. IS's tentacles spread deeper into Africa in March 2015 when Boko Haram in Nigeria took the oath of loyalty. Within a year, IS had branches or affiliates in 11 countries, though it held territory in only five, including Iraq and Syria. It was in those two core countries that Baghdadi and his followers started implementing their state project on the ground, applying their own harsh vision of Islamic rule. To the outside world, deprived of direct access to the areas controlled by IS, one of the most obvious and shocking aspects of this was their systematic destruction of ancient cultural and archaeological heritage sites and artefacts.  Satellite images show Palmyra's once majestic Temple of Bel before and after its destruction by Islamic State militants Some of the region's best-known and most-visited sites were devastated, including the magnificent temples of Bel and Baalshamin at Palmyra in Syria, and the Assyrian cities of Hatra and Nimrud in Iraq.  It wasn't just famous archaeological sites that came under attack. Christian churches and ancient monasteries, Shia mosques and shrines, and anything depicting figures of any sort were destroyed, and embellishments removed even from Sunni mosques. Barely a month after taking over Mosul, IS demolition squads levelled the 13th Century shrine of the Imam Awn al-Din, which had survived the Mongol invasion.  All of this was absolutely in line with IS's puritanical vision of Islam, under which any pictorial representation or shrine is revering something other than Allah, and any non-Muslim structures are monuments of idolatry. Even Saudi kings and princes to this day are buried without coffins in unmarked graves.  A video posted to YouTube in 2015 showed destruction of sculpted faces at Hatra By posting videos of many of these acts which the rest of the world saw as criminal cultural vandalism, IS also undoubtedly intended to shock. In that sense, it was the cultural equivalent of beheading aid workers.  And there was a more practical and profitable side to the onslaught on cultural heritage. In highly organised manner, IS's Treasury Department issued printed permits to loot archaeological sites, and took a percentage of the proceeds. That was just the tip of the iceberg of a complex structure of governance and control put in place as IS gradually settled into its conquests, penetrating into every aspect of people's lives in exactly the same way as Saddam Hussein's intelligence apparatus had done. Captured documents published by Der Spiegel in 2015, external give some idea of the role of ex-Baathist regime men in setting up and running IS in a highly structured and organised way, with much emphasis on intelligence and security. Residents of Sunni strongholds like Mosul and Falluja in Iraq, and Raqqa in Syria, found that IS operatives already knew almost everything about everybody when they moved in and took over in 2014.  At checkpoints, ID cards were checked against databases on laptops, obtained from government ration or employee registers. Former members of the security forces had to go to specific mosques to ""repent"", hand over their weapons and receive a discharge paper. ""At first, all they did was change the preachers in the mosques to people with their own views,"" said a Mosul resident who fled a year later.  ""But then they began to crack down. Women who had been able to go bare-headed now had to cover up, first with the headscarf and then with the full face-veil. Men have to grow beards and wear short-legged trousers. Cigarettes, hubble-bubble, music and cafes were banned, then satellite TV and mobile phones. Morals police [hisba] vehicles would cruise round, looking for offenders."" This video can not be played Citizen journalists from Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently (RBSS) describe life in the IS-controlled city A Falluja resident recounted the story of a taxi-driver who had picked up a middle-aged woman not wearing a headscarf. They were stopped at an IS checkpoint,  the woman given a veil and allowed to go, while the driver was sent to an Islamic court, and sentenced to two months' detention and to memorise a portion of the Koran. If you fail to memorise, the sentence is repeated.  ""They have courts with judges, officials, records and files, and there are fixed penalties for each crime, it's not random,"" said the Falluja resident, speaking when IS still controlled the city. ""Adulterers are stoned to death. Thieves have their hands cut off. Gays are executed by being thrown off high buildings. Informers are shot dead, Shia militia prisoners are beheaded."" This video can not be played A Raqqa resident describes daily life under so-called Islamic State. An activist based in Raqqa from a group called Al-Sharqiya 24 has been keeping a diary of what life is like under Islamic State group rule.  Life under 'Islamic State': Diaries IS departments carried the organisation's grip into every corner of life, including finance, agriculture, education, transport, health, welfare and utilities.  School curricula were overhauled in line with IS precepts, with history rewritten, all images being removed from schoolbooks and English taken off the menu.  ""One thing you can say is this,"" said the Mosul resident after IS took over. ""There is absolutely no corruption, no wasta [knowing the right people and pulling strings]. They are totally convinced they are on the right track."" Map, purportedly produced by IS, showing group's aspirational takeover of all lands historically controlled by caliphates and Ottoman Empire One story tells a lot about IS and its ways.  As Iraqi security forces were pressing forward in areas around Ramadi in early 2016, civilians were fleeing the battle - and IS fighters, losing the day, were trying to sneak out too. Two women, running from the combat zone, approached a police checkpoint.  As they were being waved through to safety, one of the women suddenly turned to the police, pointed at the other, and said : ""This is not a woman. He's an IS emir [commander]."" The police investigated, and it was true. The other woman was a man, who had shaved, and put on makeup and women's clothes. He turned out to be top of the list of wanted local IS commanders.  ""When IS arrived, he killed my husband, who was a policeman, raped me, and then took me as his wife,"" the woman told the police. ""I put up with him all this time, waiting to avenge my husband and my honour,"" she said. ""I tricked him into shaving and putting on makeup, then denounced him to the police.""

She managed to escape the city and became a refugee in Europe, where she met up with the BBC.  This story is based on her experiences and those of her two sisters, who were still inside the city when it was held by IS.  Taking on the world Having taken over vast swathes of territory in Iraq with their lightning offensive in June 2014, the militants might have been expected to calm down and consolidate their gains.  But, like a shark that has to keep moving or else it will die, IS barely paused before initiating a new spiral of provocation and reprisals that was predictably to draw it into active conflict with almost all the major world powers.  Already, the June offensive had threatened the approaches to Baghdad, prompting the Americans to start bringing in hundreds of military advisers and trainers to see how to help the struggling Iraqi army.  Just two months later, the attack on Kurdish areas in the north triggered US air strikes in defence of the Kurdistan capital, Irbil, and then to help stave off the threat of genocide to the Yazidis. Fourteen other nations were to join the air campaign. Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga fighters head to the Mosul dam (August, 2014 ) Ten days later, IS beheaded James Foley and the others followed, in line with the doctrine of exemplary brutality as punishment, deterrent and provocation. The most shocking was to come some months later, with the burning alive of the downed Jordanian pilot Moaz al-Kasasbeh. Shock intended.  The US-led bombing campaign was extended to Syria in September 2014 after IS besieged the Kurdish-held town of Kobane on the Turkish border. Coalition air strikes turned the tide there. IS lost hundreds of fighters killed at Kobane and elsewhere. More revenge was called for. IS turned abroad. In the three years following the declaration of the ""caliphate"" in 2014, at least 150 attacks in 29 countries across the globe were either carried out or inspired by IS, with well over 2,000 victims killed.  The attacks carried the same message of punishment, deterrence and provocation as the hostage beheadings, while also demonstrating IS's global reach.  At the same time, they carried through the militants' doctrine of distracting the enemy by setting fires in different locations and making him squander resources on security. For IS, ""the enemy"" is everybody who does not embrace it. The world is divided into Dawlat al-Islam, the State of Islam, and Dawlat al-Kufr, the State of Unbelief.  The most consequential of these atrocities were the downing of a Russian airliner over Sinai on 31 October 2015 and the Paris attacks on 13 November, provoking both Russia and France to intensify air strikes on IS targets in Syria.  The lone-wolf massacre at a gay club in Orlando, Florida, on 12 June 2016, while apparently inspired rather than organised by IS, would undoubtedly further stiffen the US's already steely resolve to finish the organisation. Had IS gone mad? It seemed determined to take on the whole world. It was goading and confronting the Americans, the Russians, and a long list of others. By its own count, it had a mere 40,000 fighters at its command (other estimates went as low as half that).  A memorial to the victims of downed Airbus A321, at Pulkovo Airport in Russia, in November 2015 Could it really challenge the global powers and hope to survive? Or would President Barack Obama and his successor Donald Trump be able to fulfil Mr Obama's pledge to ""degrade and ultimately destroy"" the organisation? Final showdown If there seemed to be something apocalyptic about IS's ""bring it on"" defiance, that's because there was. When the organisation first brought out its online magazine - a major showcase and recruitment tool - just a month after the ""caliphate"" was declared, it was not by chance that it was named Dabiq. A small town north of Aleppo in Syria, Dabiq is mentioned in a hadith (a reported saying of the Prophet Muhammad) in connection with Armageddon. In IS mythology, it is the scene where a cataclysmic showdown will take place between the Muslims and the infidels, leading to the end of days. Each issue of Dabiq begins with a quote from Abu Musab Zarqawi: ""The spark has been lit here in Iraq, and its heat will continue to intensify - by Allah's permission - until it burns the crusader armies in Dabiq."" Dabiq - Islamic State's online magazine The prospect of taking part in that final glorious climax, achieving martyrdom on the path of Allah and an assured place in paradise, is one of the thoughts inspiring those heeding the IS call to jihad.  That could help explain why the organisation seemed to enjoy an endless supply of recruits willing to blow themselves to pieces in suicide attacks, which it calls ""martyrdom-seeking operations"" (suicide is forbidden in Islam). Hundreds have died in this way, and they happen virtually daily.  It's been one of the elements that made IS a formidable fighting force hard to destroy even in strictly military terms.  Former Iraqi army officers have helped organise and direct IS IS is in many respects a project of former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's outlawed Baath party, but now with a different ideology. Former agents or officers of Saddam Hussein's regime dominate its leadership... They represent a battle-hardened and state-educated core that would likely endure (as they have done through US occupation and a decade of war) even if the organisation's middle and lower cadres are decimated. What made IS so formidable? The head of security and intelligence for the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) in northern Iraq, Masrour Barzani, tells the story of a frustrated would-be suicide bomber who screamed at his captors: ""I was just 10 minutes away from being united with the Prophet Muhammad!"" ""They think they're winners regardless of whether they kill you or they get killed,"" says Barzani. ""If they kill you, they win a battle. If they get killed, they go to heaven. With people like this, it's very difficult to deter them from coming at you. So really the only way to defeat them is to eliminate them."" Probably for the first time in military history since the Japanese kamikaze squadrons of World War Two, suicide bombers are used by IS not only for occasional terrorist spectaculars, but as a standard and common battlefield tactic. Virtually all IS attacks begin with one or several suicide bombers driving explosives-rigged cars or trucks at the target, softening it up for combat squads to go in. So much so that the ""martyrdom-seekers"" have been called the organisation's ""air force"", since they serve a similar purpose. Formidable though that is, IS as a fighting force is much more than a bunch of wild-eyed fanatics eager to blow themselves up. For that, they have Saddam Hussein to thank.  ""The core of IS are former Saddam-era army and intelligence officers, particularly from the Republican Guard,"" said an international intelligence official. ""They are very good at moving their people around, resupply and so on, they're actually much more effective and efficient than the Iraqi army are. That's the hand of former military staff officers who know their business."" ""They are very professional,"" adds Masrour Barzani. ""They use artillery, armoured vehicles, heavy machinery etc, and they are using it very well. They have officers who know conventional war and how to plan, how to attack, how to defend. They really are operating on the level of a very organised conventional force. Otherwise they'd be no more than a terrorist organisation."" The partnership with the ex-Baathists, going back to Zarqawi's early days in Iraq, was clearly a vital component in IS success.  But that did not mean its fighters were invincible on the battlefield, even in the early days of stunningly rapid expansion. The Kurds in north-east Syria were fighting IS off with no outside help for a year before anybody noticed. And even now, IS makes what would conventionally be seen as costly mistakes.  In December 2015, for example, they lost several hundred fighters in one abortive attack east of Mosul alone, and probably 2,500 altogether that month alone. Pentagon officials said coalition air strikes killed some 50,000 IS militants in Iraq and Syria between August 2014 and the end of 2016. But IS initially seemed to have little difficulty making up the numbers. With a population of perhaps 10 million acquiescent Sunnis to draw on, in Iraq and Syria, most recruiting was done locally. Clearly, had it remained in place, there would soon have been a new generation of young militants, external drawn from local sources.  This video can not be played Quentin Sommerville: ""They witnessed killing close at hand"" ""I didn't join out of conviction,"" says Bakr Madloul, a 24-year-old bachelor who was arrested in December at his home in a Sunni quarter in southern Baghdad and accused of taking part in deadly IS car bomb attacks on mainly Shia areas, which he admits. Bakr says he was working as a construction foreman in Kurdistan when IS took over Mosul. He was detained for questioning by Kurdish security, and met a militant in jail who persuaded him to go to Mosul, where he joined up with IS and manned a checkpoint until it was hit by a Coalition air strike.  He was then sent back to his Baghdad suburb to help organise car bombings. The explosives-packed vehicles were sent from outside Baghdad, and his job was to place them where he was told by his controller, usually in crowded streets or markets.  Bakr Madloul (left) pictured during his time as an IS operative ""Only one of the five car bombs I handled was driven by a suicide bomber,"" he says. ""I spoke to him. He was 22 years old, an Iraqi. He believed he would go to paradise when he died. It's the easiest and quickest way to Heaven. They strongly believe this. They would blow themselves up to get to Heaven. There were older ones in their 30s and 40s."" ""I asked my controllers more than once, 'Is it OK to kill women and children?'  They would answer, 'They're all the same.' But to me, killing women and children, I didn't feel at all comfortable about that. But once you're in, you're stuck. If you try to leave, they call you a murtadd, an apostate, and they'll kill you or your family."" Bakr knows he will almost certainly hang. Since we spoke, he has in fact been given two death sentences. I asked him if he would do the same things over if he had his life again. He laughed.  ""Absolutely not. I would get out of Iraq, away from IS, away from the security forces. I took this path without realising the consequences. There is no way back. I see that now."" Bakr Madloul knows he will probably be executed But up in Kurdistan, another IS prisoner, Muhannad Ibrahim, has no such regrets. A 32-year-old from a village near Mosul with a wife and three children, he was a construction worker for a Turkish company when IS took over the city. Two of his older brothers had died fighting the Americans there in 2004 and 2006. He joined IS without hesitation and was commanding a small detachment when he was captured in a battle with the Kurds.  ""We were being oppressed by the Shia, they were always insulting and bothering us,"" he says. ""But that's not the main motivation, religious conviction is more important. All my family is religious, praise be to Allah. I came to IS through my faith and religious principles."" ""If I had my time over again, I would take the same path, the same choices. Because I am convinced by this thing, I have to go to the end. Either I am killed, or Allah will decree some other fate for me."" Captured IS fighter Muhannad Ibrahim is unrepentant Rising to the challenge Just as the 9/11 Twin Towers atrocity in 2001 had left the US and its allies with no alternative but to strike back with extreme force, the challenge mounted by IS through its numerous provocative outrages in the region and around the world could not be ignored - nor was it meant to be. But rooting out the militants from Iraq and Syria was always going to be much more complex than the campaign unleashed more than a decade earlier against al-Qaeda and its Taliban hosts in Afghanistan.  There was never any real question of a wholesale Coalition invasion of either country. Air strikes were one thing, but putting in vast numbers of troops on the ground would be something else.  Syria was embroiled in a bewilderingly complicated civil war. Iraq was also in turmoil. US forces had only pulled out three years earlier. There was no appetite for a repeat of an invasion which was almost universally seen as a disastrous blunder with lasting consequences.  But uprooting the militants could not be done by air power alone. Reliable, motivated partner forces on the ground would be needed. In both countries, they were in short supply.  In Syria, the US and its allies were already engaged with some of the motley array of Syrian rebel groups. But they never amounted to the kind of focused, cohesive forces that the Coalition was looking for - they were fragmented, fractious, increasingly Islamist in tone, and largely bent on overthrowing the Assad regime rather than turning on IS.  In Iraq, the regular armed forces were in disarray after collapsing like a house of cards in the face of the onslaught on Mosul by a few hundred IS militants. Much work would have to be done to weld them into a motivated and competent fighting force.  In both countries it was to the Kurds in the north that the Americans and their Coalition partners first turned as their most hopeful immediate allies.  The Syrian Democratic Forces emerged as a reliable partner for the US in the fight against IS The Kurdish Peshmerga forces in northern Iraq had a long relationship with the Western Coalition powers. In 2003, US special forces fought alongside them to clear Islamist militants from mountain positions near the Iranian border just before the invasion against Saddam Hussein, in which they were partners.  Humiliated by the loss of vast areas of territory to the lightning IS assault in early August 2014, the Peshmerga needed no encouragement to hit back. Less than two weeks later, with Coalition air support, they recaptured the strategic Mosul dam.  In the months that followed, they slowly clawed back much of the ground they had lost, including Sinjar in November 2015, in operations closely co-ordinated with Coalition air strikes. But in the rest of Iraq, the picture was much messier. Iraqi government forces were able to halt the IS thrust southwards towards the capital, Baghdad, but made little early progress pushing back into the mainly Sunni areas where the militants had dug in.  It was Iranian-backed Shia militias, whose emergence was consolidated under the IS threat, that made the running in the initial phases of the campaign to oust the militants, driving them out of areas north-east of Baghdad near the Iranian border and pursuing them westwards until the eventual recapture of Saddam Hussein's hometown Tikrit in the Tigris river valley in March 2015.  ""If it weren't for Iran, the democratic experiment in Iraq would have fallen,"" said Hadi al-Ameri, leader of the Iranian-backed Badr Organisation, one of the biggest Shia fighting groups, known as the Hashd al-Shaabi or Popular Mobilisation (PM), that rose in defence of Baghdad and the south.  ""Obama was sleeping, and he didn't wake up until IS was at the gates of Irbil. When they were at the gates of Baghdad, he did nothing. Were it not for Iran's support, IS would have taken over the whole Gulf, not just Iraq."" But in the Sunni heartlands of Anbar province to the west of Baghdad the Iraqi state forces were struggling.  In May 2015, IS militants captured the provincial capital, Ramadi. At the same time, they spread their grip in Syria, taking the iconic city of Palmyra (Tadmur) in the desert east of Homs. It was a clear signal that while the organisation may have been dealt some setbacks it was still at the height of its powers and capable of exploiting any weaknesses it found.  But the Americans were quietly busy preparing for the real war on IS. They had poured billions into rebuilding the Iraqi army after 2003, only to see much of it go to pieces under pressure because so much was wrong with its foundations.  Now, putting in several thousand advisers, they focused on training and equipping the key Iraqi special forces - the Counter-Terrorism Service (CTS), otherwise known as the Golden Division - that was to play a crucial role spearheading the drive against the militants.  The systematic lashback began with Anbar province and the eventual recapture of Ramadi at the end of 2015 and early 2016, a grinding and costly operation with close Coalition air support. There was huge destruction and the displacement of most of the city's largely Sunni population. There were also tensions over the deployment of Iranian-backed, mainly Shia militias in core Sunni areas, though they were largely kept out of the city itself.  Pro-government forces patrol Ramadi The recapture of Ramadi tightened the noose around the even more iconic centre of Sunni sentiment at nearby Falluja, where militants had fought two major battles with the Americans in 2004. Government and PM forces began closing in around the city in early 2016, soon after taking Ramadi. By now, after a lot of testing and assessing, the Americans and their allies, working closely with local forces, were clearly embarked on a comprehensive strategy to ""degrade and ultimately destroy"" IS wherever it could be found. The broad lines were spelled out in February 2016 by Lt Gen Sean McFarland, then the commanding general of the Coalition's Combined Joint Task Force - Operation Inherent Resolve. ""The campaign has three objectives: to destroy the ISIL parent tumour in Iraq and Syria by collapsing its power centres in Mosul and Raqqa; two, to combat the emerging metastases of the ISIL tumour worldwide; and three, to protect our nations from attack."" Next step on the road to Mosul, the battle for Falluja was joined in late May 2016 and took just over a month of assaults, bombardments and air strikes to complete, with civilians again paying a heavy price. IS fighters deployed their full range of battle tactics, with snipers, booby-traps and suicide bombers making advance difficult and dangerous for the attacking forces.  Despite the attrition suffered by the Iraqi forces, especially the elite CTS forces, it was not long before eyes turned to the big prize - Mosul. With President Obama due to bow out early in the new year, the Americans were getting impatient.  In peacetime roughly 10 times the size of either Falluja or indeed the IS ""capital"" Raqqa, Mosul was never going to be an easy nut to crack. It had fallen to the militants in a matter of hours in 2014. By the time the government and Coalition campaign to dislodge them was finally launched in mid-October 2016, IS had had nearly two-and-a-half years to dig in and prepare its defences.  There is a moment in the journey into Raqqa when you leave the real world behind. After the bombed-out Samra bridge, any signs of normal life vanish. Turn right at the shop that once sold gravestones - its owner is long gone - and you are inside the city. Ahead lies nothing but destruction and grey dust and rubble. This is a place drained of colour, of life, and of people. In six days inside Raqqa, I didn't see a single civilian. The city fit for no-one Marshalled against a band of militants variously estimated at between 2,000 and 12,000 with a hard core probably closer to 4,000 or 5,000, was a vast assembly of government and auxiliary forces, estimated at around 100,000, counting regular army and federal police units, Kurdish Peshmerga forces, and the Popular Mobilisation, including some Sunni and minority volunteers as well as Shia militias. It was an epic battle that was to last nine months. Government forces slowly battered their way in around the city through dozens of outlying villages and finally into Mosul's eastern half, which was declared ""liberated"" towards the end of January 2017. Then it was on to the western side of the river and the old city, with its dense warren of narrow streets.  The area around the ancient Great Mosque of al-Nuri, where Abu Bakr al-Baghdad had made his only public appearance as the newly-anointed ""caliph"", was the last to fall. The mosque was blown up, almost exactly three years after the declaration of the IS ""caliphate"". The evidence was that IS itself had destroyed it, rather than let it fall into ""infidel"" hands. The Iraqi Prime Minister, Haider al-Abadi, saw this as ""official recognition of defeat"" by the militants. It signalled, he said, ""the collapse of the IS caliphate and a grand military victory"". This video can not be played The Iraqi military circulated a video it says shows the destruction of Mosul's Great Mosque of al-Nuri. It was indeed a monumental achievement, a massive body-blow to the IS state project. The city had been, as a senior Western official in northern Iraq put it, ""the beating heart of IS"", in real terms much more important than Raqqa in Syria.  But it came at huge cost. The years of preparation and months of battering that it took to dislodge a few thousand militants stood in stark contrast to the ease with which they had rolled into the city virtually unopposed in June 2014. Some estimates put the number of civilians killed at more than 40,000. At least 1,200 Iraqi security personnel also died in battle. The damage was estimated at $50bn. Hundreds thousands of mainly Sunni inhabitants were displaced, and there were widespread allegations of abuses.  The weeks that followed saw a further rapid erosion of the group's territorial position in Iraq. By the end of August 2017, it had been driven out of Tal Afar, an important town controlling the main road from Mosul towards Syria. A month later, another long-standing IS pocket in and around the mainly Sunni town of Hawija, west of Kirkuk, was also largely overrun by government and auxiliary forces.  In Iraq, that left IS in control only of the area in and around the town of al-Qaim, on the River Euphrates by the Syrian border in the far west of Anbar province.  Its presence in the country had been very radically degraded. But the organisation was still far from destroyed. Across in Syria, the overall picture by the autumn of 2017 was roughly the same, despite the country's very different, extremely complex and fast-moving situation. In 2014 and 2015, IS had substantial holdings in Syria - it looked as though someone had spilled a bottle of black ink on its map. They controlled virtually the whole of Syria's stretch of the Euphrates, from Albu Kamal on the Iraqi border, up through Deir al-Zour and Raqqa, the Tabqa dam, and on to Jarablus on the border with Turkey, one of several crossings that were lifelines for the militants. They held towns and villages to the east and north of Aleppo (including the near-mythical Dabiq) and other pockets further south, including Palmyra and nearby oilfields.  But this heyday did not last. In Syria, IS found itself facing, not one motley coalition of enemies as in Iraq, but three.  The Americans, despairing of Syrian rebel groups whose interests lay elsewhere, adopted the experienced Syrian Kurdish fighters of the YPG, the Popular Protection Units, as their main on-the-ground partners. They added on as many Arab and minority fighters as they could find to produce the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), their favoured vehicle against IS in Syria. A cruise missile is fired from Russian ship in the Mediterranean Sea (Russian Defence Ministry handout) This did not go down at all well with the US's Nato ally Turkey, which sees the YPG and their parent political body, the Democratic Unity Party (PYD), as terrorists because of their affiliation to Turkey's own Kurdish rebels, the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK).  Often seeming to be working at cross-purposes to the Americans, Ankara set up its own coalition from among the Syrian opposition groups it had been backing and facilitating for years.  IS also received attention from a third coalition, grouping Syrian government forces, Iran and Russia. The Russians carried out air strikes against IS positions partly with the same kind of motivation as the Western Coalition - revenge for the downing by IS of the Russian airliner over Sinai in October 2015 - but their real strategic interest was different.   The Russians and Iranians were bent on securing their investment in the Assad regime, helping it restore its authority in the country, and pre-empting any move by the Americans and their allies to block a link-up between eastern Syria and western Iraq that would give Tehran a direct land connection from Iran all the way to Lebanon.  That thought may have been somewhere in Washington's head, but its primary concern was hitting and destroying IS.  Turkey for its part had a different overriding preoccupation: to prevent the Syrian Kurds from expanding and joining up the areas they controlled along the southern side of the Turkey-Syria border.  Despite these conflicting motivations, for IS the result was the same - pressure on many fronts. The US-backed SDF made the most headway, systematically whittling away IS assets step-by-step, but Turkey and Syrian government forces were also on the march.  As early as September 2014, US air strikes had helped prevent IS taking over the Kurdish-held town of Kobane on the border with Turkey. After that, the SDF were pushing forward. By October 2016, IS had lost all access to the Turkish border, a huge logistical setback - virtually all foreign jihadists bound for both Syria and Iraq had come that way, apart from other advantages.  Smoke rises from a bombed building in Deir al-Zour The Turkish-backed Syrian rebels also played their part, taking over IS-held areas north and east of Aleppo - including Dabiq, which fell in a mundane enough manner with none of the apocalyptic ""burning of the Crusader armies"" heralded in IS mythology.  Gradually the militants' tide receded further and further down the Euphrates valley, with the SDF, backed by perhaps 2,000 US special forces with artillery and air power, doing most of the pushing. By November 2016, the SDF were in a position to launch a campaign to isolate and eventually attack the IS ""capital"", Raqqa. The assault on the city itself began in early June 2017.  By then, much of the population and many IS fighters had already fled, with most of the militants heading further downstream to the final major city largely under their control - another provincial capital, Deir al-Zour.  But before the recapture of Raqqa had been completed, Russian- and Iranian-backed Syrian government forces were already thrusting towards Deir al-Zour, where a military base and airport had held out against the IS militants for almost three years. To get there, the government forces had recaptured Palmyra (for the second time) in March and pushed eastwards along the road to take Sukhna in August before reaching Deir al-Zour itself in September.  US-backed SDF forces had already bypassed the yet-to-fall Raqqa and moved into oil-rich areas to the east of Deir al-Zour, laying claim to oil and gasfields that would greatly bolster the Kurds' ambitions to run their own area in the north of the country - or at least strengthen their hand in eventual negotiations with Damascus. So as 2017 moved into its final months, IS territorial control in Syria seemed to be as doomed as it was in Iraq - bottled up in a small patch straddling the border around al-Qaim in western Iraq and Albu Kamal in Syria. Rooting the militants out from there would not necessarily be a simple task in a fiercely tribal area prone to defying governments.  But to all intents and purposes, the IS dream of administering and expanding a thriving Islamic state in the two countries as the core of a growing global caliphate had crashed in flames.  So had IS been virtually destroyed as well as severely degraded? Was it time to celebrate its demise?  It had certainly been dealt crippling blows in terms of functioning as a territorial state. That project lay in ruins. The administrative structures it had set up had been swept away. Major sources of finance had been cut off - from the oilfields it had controlled, taxes imposed on the millions of Iraqis and Syrians it had ruled, and cash coming in across the border with Turkey. It could no longer attract thousands of foreign jihadists or recruit locals to replace the 60,000 IS fighters the Americans believe have died since the heady days of June 2014.  With virtually all of their urban holdings lost, the militants were shrinking back into the shadows and deserts. Many of their leaders had also been killed, although Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi himself apparently eluded the hunt, issuing a defiant audio statement in September 2017. Among the known dead were Mohammed Emwazi, ""Jihadi John"", killed by a drone strike in Syria in late 2015. But all of this had been long foreseen by the leadership. In May 2016, the man regarded as the organisation's real Number Two, spokesman and head of external operations Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, made a lengthy statement already foreshadowing the next phase of IS existence.  ""You will never be victorious. You will be defeated,"" he told the Americans. ""Do you think that victory comes by killing one leader or another? That would be a fake victory!"" ""Or do you consider defeat to be the loss of a city or the loss of territory? Were we defeated when we lost the cities in Iraq [in 2007-8] and were in the desert without any city or land? And would we be defeated, and you victorious, if you were to take Mosul or Sirte or Raqqa, or even all the cities, and we were to return to our previous situation? Absolutely not! True defeat is the loss of will and desire to fight."" Abu Muhammad al-Adnani Adnani, who as spokesman had announced the birth of ""Islamic State"" and the caliphate in June 2014, may not have lost the will and desire to fight. But he did lose his life. He was killed by an American air strike near Aleppo in August 2016. He was right to suggest that the targeted killing of militant leaders has in general had little discernible impact on the course of movements, psychologically important though it may be.  But the Iraqi expert on radical movements, Hisham al-Hashemi, believes the case of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi might be different. The Americans are unlikely to rest until they have killed Baghdadi, not least because of their belief that he personally repeatedly raped an American NGO worker, Kayla Mueller, and then had her killed in early 2015. ""IS's future depends on Baghdadi,"" Hashemi said, speaking at a time when IS still controlled huge swathes of territory in Iraq and Syria.  ""If he is killed, it will split up. One part would stay on his track and announce a new caliphate. Another would split off and return to al-Qaeda. Others would turn into gangs following whoever is strongest."" ""The source of his strength is that he brought about an ideological transformation, blending jihadist ideas with Baathist intelligence security methods, enabling him to create this quasi-state organisation."" Baghdadi's death might not have such an impact in the new situation. But his special talents could come into their own again should conditions in either or both of those countries, or elsewhere, once again favour a comeback by the militants.  That is not so fanciful, even amid the smoking wreckage of the IS above-ground infrastructure.  In Iraq, the burning Sunni grievances against the Shia-dominated Baghdad government that allowed IS to make its astonishing advances in 2014 have not been seriously addressed. American officials are already referring to the danger of an ""AQI-2"" emerging - a second al-Qaeda in Iraq. It has happened before.  The wholesale destruction of Sunni towns and cities in the drive against IS and the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Sunnis may even have aggravated those grievances, providing fertile ground for militants to infiltrate back.  There is an optimistic argument that the united cross-sectarian effort that it took to drive the militants out may have sown the seeds of a new Iraqi nationalism. But the fact remains that the Sunni community has been crushed, and the Shia majority dominates both politically and through the proliferation of its powerful militias. Political leaderships in Baghdad have signally failed to promote any serious national reconciliation since 2003.  ""IS was essentially an Iraqi creation,"" said a senior Western intelligence official, speaking shortly before the militants were ousted from Mosul.  ""The tragic reality is that at the moment, it is the main Sunni political entity in Iraq. From the West, it's looked at as a kind of crazed cult. Here in Iraq it represents an important constituency. It represents a massive dissatisfaction, the alienation of a whole sector of the population."" Thousands of IS cases are being tried in courts like Nineveh Criminal Court in Qaraqosh (above) A young man wearing a shabby, brown prisoner's outfit stands before three black-robed judges in a tiny, provincial courtroom, shaking nervously. After sipping some water, he confirms his name: Abdullah Hussein. He is accused of fighting for so-called Islamic State (IS). ""The decision of the court has been taken according to articles 2 and 3 of the 2005 Counterterrorism Law,"" states the judge. ""Death by hanging."" And then Hussein - who, like many suspects here, was picked up on the Mosul frontline - breaks down crying. Inside the Iraqi courts sentencing IS suspects to death Much work remains to be done if that sobering assessment is to be reversed. And Baghdad meanwhile faces multiple challenges that might help tip it back into the state of chaos in which the militants could thrive.  The state's coffers are empty at a time when the reconstruction bill is estimated conservatively at $100bn. Corruption is endemic. Apart from the Sunni issue, Baghdad politics is in turmoil, with deep rivalries between Shia factions with greater or lesser attachment to Iran. And the threat of secession by the Kurds in the north, after the September 2017 independence referendum, could bring further instability.  The very least that could be expected post-Mosul was an indefinite period of low-level insurgency, with bomb blasts and suicide attacks in different parts of the country, especially aimed, as before, at mainly Shia areas. It was already happening. The US military's Combating Terrorism Center reported that by mid-2017 there was already an average of 130 insurgent attacks taking place monthly in the ""liberated"" eastern half of Mosul.  And it was already happening next door in Syria too, with IS carrying out random deadly explosions in Damascus and elsewhere despite its stark loss of territory. Although it was obvious by late 2017 that the Assad government with its Russian and Iranian backers were prevailing, the final pattern of control and governance country-wide remained uncertain.  There were many ways in which further turmoil could ensue, not least the fact that, with US support, Kurdish forces had spread well beyond their own demographic comfort zone, causing huge resentment among some Sunni elements. As in Iraq, many Syrian Sunnis were bound to feel aggrieved by everything that had happened since the civil war broke out in 2011.  And where there were grievances, IS or its successors would surely be there to build on them.  Capitalising on chaos IS had in any case been busy spreading its bets and developing other territorial possibilities beyond the ""parent tumour"" of Iraq and Syria.  Libya initially proved the most promising. It had just the kind of failed-state anarchy, the state of ""savagery"", that left room for the jihadists to move in, forging alliances with local militants and disgruntled supporters of the overthrown regime of Muammar Gaddafi, just as they had done in Iraq. IS signalled its arrival there in typical style, issuing a polished video in February 2015 showing a group of 21 bewildered Egyptian Christian workers in orange jumpsuits being beheaded on a Libyan beach, their blood mingling with the waters of the Mediterranean as a warning to the ""Crusader"" European countries on the other side of the sea that radical Islam was on the way. The man who voiced that warning was believed to be the IS leader in Libya, an Iraqi called Wissam al-Zubaydi, also known as Abu Nabil. By coincidence, Zubaydi was killed in a US air strike on the same day IS struck in Paris, 13 November 2015.  A Libyan security official at a site used by so-called Islamic State near Sirte The militants took over a big stretch of the coast and the central city of Sirte, which was to Muammar Gaddafi what Tikrit was to Saddam Hussein. Another American air strike in February killed (among nearly 50 other people) Noureddine Chouchane, reputedly an IS figure responsible for the deadly attacks on Western tourists in his native Tunisia.  But the IS presence in Libya soon came under pressure, with militias loyal to the Government of National Accord, which been born out of UN efforts, dislodging the militants from Sirte in the second half of 2016.  But they did not disappear. The Americans launched an air strike on IS elements south of Sirte in October 2017, their first such action in Libya since President Trump took over.  The militants were undoubtedly on the defensive in Libya. But it remained a deeply fragmented country, and its new government far from powerful or universally accepted. There would likely continue to be pockets of chaos there for the jihadists to exploit. And there was no shortage of other possibilities being actively explored and developed - Yemen, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia, the Philippines, Nigeria... wherever there were dysfunctional states and angry Muslims, there would be opportunities for IS, competing strongly with a diminished al-Qaeda as a dominant brand in the jihadist market. Adding the extra risk for the West, that that competition could be another spur for spectacular terrorist attacks which they know are being actively plotted.  Long before IS lost almost all its territorial gains in Iraq and Syria, it was clear that the organisation, while trying its best to hold ground wherever it could, was trying to stay alive and assert itself (""Remaining and Expanding"") in other ways - renewed insurgency in the lost lands, constant propaganda and proselytising on the internet, and above all, a revitalised push to carry out acts of terror in the West, the more shocking the better.   As early as September 2014, just as IS was embarking on its provocative confrontation with the West, spokesman Abu Muhammad al-Adnani urged the movement's followers in graphic detail to kill the hated infidels. ""If you can kill a disbelieving American or European - especially the spiteful and filthy French - or an Australian, or a Canadian, or any other of the unbelievers waging war, including the citizens of the countries that entered a coalition against the Islamic State, then rely upon Allah, and kill him in any manner or way however it may be. Smash his head with a rock, slaughter him with a knife, run him over with your car, throw him down from a high place, choke him or poison him."" In his statement in May 2016, al-Adnani signalled the organisation's new stress on attacks inside Western countries in response to the drive against it in Iraq and Syria.  ""Truly, the smallest act you do in their lands is more beloved to us than the biggest act done here; it is more effective for us and more harmful to them... Know that your targeting those who are called ""civilians"" is more beloved to us and more effective, as it is more harmful, painful, and a greater deterrent to them."" Attacks in Europe and elsewhere intensified almost in direct proportion to IS' loss of terrain in Iraq and Syria. Among the more notable were the truck assault in Nice, France, in July 2016 (at least 86 killed) and a similar attack in Berlin in December (12 killed), the Istanbul nightclub bombing in January 2017 (39 killed), and two vehicle and knife attacks in London in March and June 2017 (15 killed).  The attacks in London broke new ground for IS, and even more so the suicide bomb attack at the Manchester Arena in May 2017 in which more than 20 people died. A van attack in Barcelona in August in which 13 people were killed was also seen as an advance for the militants.  Twenty-two people were killed in the Manchester bombing in 2017 These kinds of attacks, often carried out by ""lone wolves"" and involving everyday implements that are impossible to control, were clearly a nightmare for security services.  Their job was made all the more challenging by studies showing that fewer than 20% of  ""successful"" attacks in Europe and North America were carried out by jihadists who had gone to Syria or Iraq, and that most were perpetrated by citizens of the countries under attack.  While IS had managed to plant a small number of activists in the crowds of refugees and asylum seekers besieging the gates of Europe and the West, simply vetting them carefully would obviously not be enough.  Clearly, IS internet messaging was still powerful, resonating among the disaffected, the resentful, the alienated and disempowered.  The Americans, focusing largely on the military defeat of the militants, seemed taken aback by IS's ability to keep up and even expand the challenge.  ""When I consider how much damage we've inflicted and they're still operational, they're still capable of pulling off things like some of these attacks we've seen internationally, we have to conclude that we do not yet fully appreciate the scale or strength of this phenomenon,"" said Lt Gen Michael Nagata, one of the top US Special Operations officers, quoted by the Combating Terrorism Center.  ""We spend an inordinate amount of time and resources as the United States, but also as our partners, trying to not only defeat ISIS and their control of the physical caliphate, but their virtual space that they own,"" added Thomas P Bossert, President Trump's adviser on homeland security and counter-terrorism adviser.  ""They're proselytizing. It's troubling."" Clearly, tackling such a vague, ethereal and pervasive threat was a far cry from the clear-cut task of confronting IS fighters on the battlefield. The threat was not going to go away. Cyber-inspired lone wolf attacks could materialise at almost any time, any place. The price of relative safety would be eternal vigilance.  Battle for minds The US and its allies were starting to come to grips with the cyber dimension of the challenge - and giving much less priority to the crucial problem of poor governance in the countries whose dysfunctionalities provided opportunities for the radicals to take root.  But there were other parts of IS' complicated root system that were even harder to get at. The New York-based security consultancy Soufan Group estimated that more than half of the 27,000 foreign jihadists making their way to Syria and Iraq in the first 18 months of the ""Islamic State"" were from the Middle East and North Africa.  Clearly, the ""Caliphate"" had appeal, despite - perhaps in some cases, because of - its graphically publicised brutality. While vowing to degrade and destroy the organisation, President Obama put his finger on the real challenge: ""Ideologies are not defeated with guns, they are defeated by better ideas, a more attractive and more compelling vision,"" he said. On a relatively normal day... there was a total of 50 distinct pieces of propaganda. The photo reports and videos included depictions of an IS offensive in northern Syria and eulogies for the dead in Salahuddin... Overwhelmingly, though, the propagandists were preoccupied with a carefully refined view of 'normal' life. Fishing and ultraviolence The problem is that when disenchanted people in the region look around them - especially the young, the idealistic, or the hopeless unemployed who have no future - they see scant evidence of ""better ideas"" or attractive and compelling visions. They see the ruins of an ""Arab Spring"" which raised hopes only to dash them cruelly. The brutal, corrupt dictatorships which it shook have either fragmented into chaos and sectarian and tribal upheaval, like Syria itself, Libya, Yemen and (with Western intervention) Iraq, or the sinister ""deep states"" of their former regimes came back, even more harshly in the case of Egypt, less so in the case of Tunisia. While many of the European jihadists may have heeded the call for other reasons, socio-economic factors play an important part in radicalising some of the Arab jihadists, and will continue to do so unless addressed. Unidentified IS fighter Mohammed is giddy with excitement as he films the discovery of three IS fighters on his mobile phone. ""Shoot him,"" he shouts, gesturing at one of them. His nervousness gives him away as the unit's cook. He's unarmed, but his fellow soldiers from the Iraqi police special forces - known as the Emergency Response Division - are armed to the teeth and are not taking any chances. The secret lives of young IS fighters One of the biggest contingents is from Tunisia, where a detailed survey, external in the poorest suburbs of the capital Tunis showed clearly that the radicalisation of young people there had far less to do with extreme Islamic ideology as such than it did with unemployment, marginalisation and disillusion after a revolution into which they threw themselves, but which gave them nothing, and left them hopeless.  IS is also filling a desert left by the collapse of all the political ideologies that have stirred Arab idealists over the decades. Many used to travel to the Soviet Union for training and tertiary education, but communism is now seen as a busted flush. Arab socialism and Arab nationalism, which caused such excitement in the 1950s and 1960s, mutated into brutal, corrupt ""republics"" where sons were groomed to inherit power from their fathers.  In this vacuum, IS took up the cause of punishing the West and other outsiders for their actions in the region over the past century:  the carve-up by the colonial powers 100 years ago, drawing  a border between Iraq and Syria which IS has now erased  the creation of Israel under the British mandate for Palestine, and its subsequent unswerving political and financial support by the US Western (and indeed Russian) backing for corrupt and tyrannical Arab regimes the Western invasion and destruction of Iraq on the flimsiest of pretexts, with the death of uncounted thousands of Iraqis the Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo prisoner abuse scandals.... The roots of IS also lie in a crisis within Islam.  ""Isil is not Islamic,"" said President Obama, echoing statements by many Western leaders that ""IS has nothing to do with Islam"". But it has. ""It is based on Islamic texts that are reinterpreted according to how they see it,"" says Ahmad Moussalli, professor of politics at the American University of Beirut. ""I don't say they are not coming out of Islamic tradition, that would be denying facts. But their interpretation is unusual, literal sometimes, very much like the Wahhabis.""  Hisham al-Hashemi, the Iraqi expert on radical groups, agrees. ""Violent extremism in IS and the salafist jihadist groups is justified, indeed blessed, in Islamic law texts relied on by IS and the extremist groups. It's a crisis of religious discourse, not of a barbaric group. Breaking up the religious discourse and setting it on the right course is more important by far than suppressing the extremist groups militarily.""   Because ancient texts can be interpreted by extremists to cover their worst outrages does not implicate the entire religion, any more than Christianity is defined by the Inquisition, where burning at the stake was a stock penalty.  Extremist ideas remain in the dark, forgotten  corners of history unless their time comes. And IS time came, with Afghanistan, Iraq, and everything that followed.  ""Salafism is spreading in the world, in Afghanistan, Pakistan, the Arab countries,"" says Prof Moussalli.  He blames the Saudis for stifling the emergence of a moderate, democratic version of Islam, the ""alternative Islamic discourse"" to salafism that President Obama wanted to see. ""A moderate Islamic narrative today is a Muslim Brotherhood narrative, which has been destroyed by the Gulf states supporting the military coup in Egypt,"" says Prof Moussalli, referring to the Egyptian military's ousting of the elected President Mohammed Morsi, a senior Muslim Brotherhood figure, in July 2013.  ""We lost that opportunity with Egypt. Egypt could have paved the way for real change in the area. But Saudi Arabia stood against it, in a very malicious way, and destroyed the possibility of changing the Arab regimes into more democratic regimes that accept the transfer of power peacefully. They don't want it."" Saudi Arabia's ultra-conservative Wahhabi religious establishment and its constant propagation have raised ambiguity over its relations with radical groups abroad. Enemies and critics have accused it of producing the virulent strain of Wahhabism that inspires the extremists, and even of supporting IS and other ultra-salafist groups.  But Jamal Khashoggi, a leading Saudi journalist and writer who spent time in Afghanistan and knew Bin Laden, says that simply is not true ""We are at war with IS, which sees us as corrupt Wahhabis."" he says.  ""IS is a form of Wahhabism that has been suppressed here since the 1930s. It resurfaced with the siege of the Grand Mosque in Mecca in 1979 and spread here and there. But Saudi Arabia didn't back it at all, it saw it as a threat. So it's true that salafism can turn radical, just as the US right-wing produces some crazy lunatics."" Hundreds of people died in a two-week siege when extremist salafists took over the Grand Mosque, the holiest place in Islam, in protest at what they saw as the Kingdom's deviation from the true path.  More recently, Saudi Arabia's security forces and its Shia minority have in fact been the target of attacks by IS, and the kingdom has executed captured militants. It has an active deradicalisation programme.  This video can not be played Saudi Arabia's 'creative' approach to de-radicalisation But the Kingdom's extreme conservatism, its distaste for democracy, and its custodianship of the shrines in Mecca and Medina to which millions of Muslims make pilgrimage every year, have made it one of the main targets for calls for a hard-to-achieve reformation within Islam as part of the battle to defeat IS and other extremist groups.  The winds of change do now seem to be starting to blow through the desert kingdom, with cautious reforms behind which the young Crown Prince, Muhammad Bin Salman, is seen as the driving force.  Although the 2017 decree allowing women to drive caused a stir, it remains to be seen how deep such changes can go in a country where the grip of the ultra-conservative clergy is still strong, and where official primary schoolbooks still teach that all religions apart from Islam are ""false"".  Changing some of the fundamental interpretations of religion is a monumental undertaking that could take generations. But it cannot come fast enough for a senior Sunni politician in Iraq.  ""We must accept the fact that Islam has a crisis,"" he says. ""IS is not a freak. Look at the roots, the people, the aims. If you don't deal with the roots, the situation will be much more dangerous. The world has to get rid of IS, but needs a new deal: reformation, in Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, al-Azhar [the ancient seat of Sunni Islamic learning and authority in Cairo].""   ""You can't kill all the Muslims. You need an Islamic reformation. But Saudi and Qatari money has been blotting out the voices so we can't get anywhere. It's the curse of the Arab world - too much oil, too much money."" Sunni Axis v Shia Crescent The demise of the IS as a ""state"" straddling Iraq and Syria has huge geo-strategic implications, few of them positive for the US and its regional allies.  While President Trump railed and tweeted against the evil of Iran and its sponsorship of terrorism, Tehran was quietly benefitting from everything the Americans were doing against IS.  They were non-speaking, arms-length partners in the campaign against the militants in Iraq. US air power, training and hardware directly helped the official Iraqi forces. But the Iranian-backed Shia militias played their part in a series of campaigns ending in a victory which greatly expanded their presence. The rise and fall of the IS phenomenon in Iraq left Iran's influence there stronger than ever.  While the distance between the American and Iranian roles in Syria was even bigger, with Iran on the side of the regime and the US originally backing the rebels, both were fighting IS, and its defeat would ultimately benefit the Assad regime and its Iranian backers. The Americans and their Coalition allies will not be around forever. Iran and its local allies will.  Hadi al-Ameri, leader of the Badr Organisation, one of the biggest Shia fighting groups The US had little choice but to do what it did. The superpower could not allow itself to be goaded and provoked with impunity.  But it had earlier opened the floodgates to Iranian influence through a war that was purely elective, a war of choice and ambition rather than necessity: the invasion of Iraq in 2003, launched on pretexts (Saddam Hussein's possession of weapons of mass destruction and his support for terrorism) that turned out to be totally spurious.  By dismantling the Iraqi state in 2003, the US-led coalition was breaking down the bulwark that had contained Iran, the region's Shia superpower, seen as a threat by the Saudis and most of their Sunni Gulf partners since the Islamic Revolution in 1979. The empowerment of the majority Shia community in Iraq after 2003 gave Iran unrivalled influence over Iraqi politics. For years, it had been backing anti-Saddam Iraqi Shia factions in exile. Now they came home to rule the roost.  The arrival of the IS threat led to even more Iranian influence, through the arming, training and directing of the burgeoning Iraqi Shia militias.  For Saudi Arabia and its allies, Iranian penetration in Iraq threatens to establish, indeed largely has, a Shia crescent linking Iran, Iraq, Syria under its minority Alawite leadership, and Lebanon dominated by the Iranian-created Shia faction, Hezbollah. From the outset of the war in Syria in 2011, the regional Sunni powers - the Saudis and their Gulf partners, and Turkey - backed the Sunni rebels in the hope that the overthrow of Assad would establish Sunni majority rule. A north-south Sunni axis running from Turkey through Syria to Jordan and Saudi Arabia would split the Shia crescent and foil the Iranian project, as they saw it. That is essentially what IS did in 2014, when it moved back into Iraq, took Mosul and virtually all the country's Sunni areas, and established a Sunni entity that straddled the suddenly irrelevant border with Syria, blocking off Shia parts of Iraq from Syria. Now that Sunni stake through the heart of the Shia crescent has been removed by the military defeat of IS and the failure of the Saudis, Turks and others - all American allies - to bring about regime change in Damascus.  It's intriguing to wonder what would have happened had IS halted its advances and provocations after the seizure of Mosul in 2014, toned down its rhetoric, perhaps made some local compromises and accommodations.  Just after the fall of Mosul, I asked the Iraqi Kurdistan President, Masoud Barzani, whether he could live with his new neighbours.  ""You don't choose your neighbours,"" was his reply. But five weeks later, IS attacked and overran his areas, threatening the Kurdistan capital Irbil, and inflicting genocide on the Yazidis.  ""Had they not become international terrorists and stayed local terrorists, they could have served the original agenda of dividing the Arab east so there would be no Shia crescent,"" says Prof Moussalli. We may never fully understand why IS did it. Perhaps its virulent strain of Salafism just had to keep pushing outwards: ""Remaining and Expanding"". The Islamic State in its original form has been smashed. But for all the reasons that brought it about, IS and everything it represented will still be around in one form or another for a very long time to come.

Yield Spread Sentiment,China takes a victory lap over US protests,2024-09-14,2020-06-05,By Zhaoyin Feng,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52912241,"The US mass protests are raising eyebrows around the world, but China is watching with particular interest. As anti-racism protests sweep across the US, Beijing has seized upon them to hit back at Washington for supporting last year's Hong Kong pro-democracy demonstrations. Chinese state media have given extensive coverage to the protests, highlighting the chaotic scenes and alleged police brutality in America to claim that China enjoys greater social stability. Speaking to an international audience, Chinese diplomats are attempting to portray Beijing as a responsible global leader, standing in solidarity with other countries in condemning the racial disparity and injustice in the US.  China's state news agency Xinhua described the US civil unrest as ""Pelosi's beautiful landscape"" - a reference to US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's comment last summer that the Hong Kong protests were ""a beautiful sight to behold"". State media Global Times' chief editor Hu Xijin wrote that American politicians now can ""enjoy this sight from their own windows"".  Beijing has long condemned American politicians, including Ms Pelosi, for ""glorifying violence"" coming from the Hong Kong demonstrators, who are categorised by China as ""rioters showing signs of terrorism"".  Protests paralysed Hong Kong for most of last year, prompting Beijing to impose a new national security law in the territory in May, only two weeks ahead of the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square crackdown. Aynne Kokas, senior faculty fellow with the University of Virginia's Miller Center for Public Affairs, says that both the US and China are contending with a high level of domestic instability triggered by the global coronavirus pandemic and political events.  ""Now is a key moment through which China is able to leverage the lack of stability in the US, in order to more efficiently promote its own national security goals,"" she says.  Chinese and Hong Kong officials have also called out the US for applying ""double standards"" in its response to civil unrest. ""You know there are riots in the United States and we see how local governments reacted,"" said Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam. ""And then in Hong Kong, when we had similar riots, we saw what position they adopted then.""  The officials' view is shared by many Chinese social media users, who dub America ""the double standard nation"".  Allegations of excessive use of police force during the US protests have been put under the spotlight by Chinese state media, to delegitimise Washington's position on upholding freedom and democracy. In one example, state broadcaster China Central Television reported on American journalists being pepper sprayed and a freelance photographer partially blinded by a rubber bullet while covering the protests. Georgia State University Global Communication Assistant Professor Maria Repnikova says that the scale and intensity of Chinese state media coverage on the US protests is unprecedented.  ""It's powerful, because they are not making it up,"" Prof Repnikova says, but she points out that Chinese state media have cherry-picked the more peaceful pictures of Hong Kong police and the most violent ones from the US. China itself has been heavily criticised for cracking down on press freedom, which is rarely mentioned by the government and state media. On Weibo, many see America's freedoms and democracy as at risk, as police fired tear gas at peaceful protesters and military was deployed to quell the protests.  Ms Kokas says: ""Chinese state media don't have to craft a narrative, they can just talk about the objective events that have happen in Washington DC, that undermines the very principle of freedom of speech and freedom of assembly.""  The US's rhetoric about the democratic rights of Hong Kong now seems ""very hollow""，she adds, ""when military helicopters are flying over [Washington] DC"". The increasingly outspoken Chinese diplomats have seized the chance to spotlight the US's governing failure and promote Beijing as a more responsible global leader.  Ms Kokas describes this as a continuation of the country's propaganda strategy on the Covid-19 pandemic - when America fails, China is here to help. Chinese diplomats on Twitter retweeted messages of UN and African Union officials, condemning racial discrimination and police brutality in the US. The Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying tweeted ""I can't breathe"", with a screencap of the US state department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus' previous criticism over Beijing's handling in Hong Kong.  But another of Hua's messages denouncing anti-black racism backfired on Twitter, as she included ""all lives matter"", a phrase often used to undermine the ""black lives matter"" movement. Meanwhile, there are reports that African residents in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou have been discriminated against and forced into quarantine during the coronavirus pandemic.  Beijing has not officially apologised for any mishandling, only stating that there were some ""misunderstandings"".  One Weibo user expresses ""disappointment"", as the person sees ""some Chinese criticise others for racial discrimination, but when it comes to their own anti-black racism, they take it for granted"". China is also accused of detaining hundreds of thousands of Uighurs and other Muslim minorities in high-security prison camps in its far western Xinjiang region. There's no doubt  US protests have sparked heated discussion on Weibo - the topic is one of the most popular on the site this week. Related posts have earned more than 25 billion views. Many Weibo posts ""congratulate"" the US for the civil unrest and push back at its support for the Hong Kong demonstrations.  One user writes: ""The US government has been inflaming violence around the world, now the American people have finally woken up. The US government deserves this!""  And Beijing and its state media spread the theory that Washington was fomenting the protests in Hong Kong, calling it a ""black hand"" behind the unrest. As US-China relations have soured due to the Hong Kong protests, trade conflicts and the pandemic, anti-America sentiment appears to be on the rise in China. Thousands of Weibo comments describe the US protests as ""karma"" for Washington. But some Chinese seem genuinely saddened by the situation.  ""This is trampling on human rights! Democracy in the US came to an end at this exact moment,"" a Weibo user commented under a video showing the CNN reporter getting arrested, receiving thousands of likes.  Many on Weibo also voice support for the civil rights movement. ""Nothing much has changed after generations of fights. I hope this time will yield better results,"" a comment reads. Some Chinese also reflect on the weaknesses of their country. One Weibo user writes about being ""envious of the freedom of expression"" in the US, as anti-government protests are often forcefully cracked down in China. Some posts urge the state media to cover China's domestic police violence and injustice with the same level of dedication.   But liberal voices are often met with harsh criticism. State-affiliated yet liberal leaning newspaper Beijing News published a commentary advocating for empathy and respect for the American people, but it was quickly slammed as taking a ""pro-America"" stance and received tens of thousands of negative comments on Weibo.  Social media has always been an imperfect window to observe China's public opinion. Its echo chamber effect is exacerbated by the country's information censorship.  Prof Repnikova says that the relatively liberal views may become even more marginalised on Chinese social media, as cyber nationalism, a combination of bottom-up sentiments and top-down propaganda tactic, is increasingly dominant on the sites. ""The more aggressive, nationalistic and vocal voices are taking over the space,"" she says. Additional reporting by Yitsing Wang"

One Weibo user writes about being ""envious of the freedom of expression"" in the US, as anti-government protests are often forcefully cracked down in China. Some posts urge the state media to cover China's domestic police violence and injustice with the same level of dedication.   But liberal voices are often met with harsh criticism. State-affiliated yet liberal leaning newspaper Beijing News published a commentary advocating for empathy and respect for the American people, but it was quickly slammed as taking a ""pro-America"" stance and received tens of thousands of negative comments on Weibo.  Social media has always been an imperfect window to observe China's public opinion. Its echo chamber effect is exacerbated by the country's information censorship.  Prof Repnikova says that the relatively liberal views may become even more marginalised on Chinese social media, as cyber nationalism, a combination of bottom-up sentiments and top-down propaganda tactic, is increasingly dominant on the sites. ""The more aggressive, nationalistic and vocal voices are taking over the space,"" she says. Additional reporting by Yitsing Wang"
Yield Spread Sentiment,'I'm in coronavirus lockdown with my abuser',2024-09-14,2020-03-31,By Megha Mohan,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-52063755,"With much of the world on coronavirus lockdown, there are warnings that those living with domestic abuse could become hidden victims of the pandemic. In the UK, calls to the national abuse hotline went up by 65% this weekend, according to the domestic abuse commissioner for England and Wales. Meanwhile, the UN has warned that women in poorer countries and smaller homes are likely to have fewer ways to report abuse. The BBC has spoken to two women who are currently under lockdown with men who they say have abused them.  This interview was conducted the day before India announced a 21-day complete lockdown in order to curb the spread of coronavirus. Geeta wakes up at 5am, her husband is lying next to her on the floor. He's snoring loudly.  The previous night he had come home drunk and upset. The coronavirus outbreak meant fewer people were using public transport, so as an autowallah, or rickshaw driver, Vijay's income had dropped from 1,500 rupees a day (just over £16), to 700 rupees a day. ""How many days will be like this?"" he'd shouted, throwing a bottle of the spirit he'd been drinking against the wall. Geeta's children scrambled behind her for shelter.  Thankfully, Vijay climbed onto the small mattress the whole family share and fell asleep soon after his outburst.  ""It took a while to calm the children,"" says Geeta. ""They've seen their father angry many times in their life but the past few weeks it has been worse. They've seen him throw things against the wall and pull me by the hair.""  Geeta's husband has hit her more times than she can remember, the first time on their wedding night. She tried to leave him once, but he wouldn't let her take the children.  They live in a low-income neighbourhood, called a mohalla, in a rural area.  On a typical day she would walk a kilometre to the nearest well to fetch water for the day. Once she had taken it home, she'd chat with neighbours waiting for the grocer to arrive with his cart of vegetables.  After buying the household food for the day, Geeta would start preparing breakfast. Her husband would leave at around 7am, returning for lunch and a nap, leaving again after the two older children returned from school.  ""But things changed when the school closed on the 14th,"" she says. ""Then the children were home constantly and they began to irritate my husband. ""Usually he saves his anger for me, but he has begun to yell at them for minor things like leaving a cup on the floor. I then say something to divert his attention so he can be angry at me, but the more time we are together, the less I can think of to distract him."" Geeta had a plan. While her husband was at work, and after cleaning the house, she would walk to a nondescript office building just outside the neighbourhood. There she used to attend a secret class set up by community organisers where women learn to sew, read and write.  Geeta wants to get enough skills to be financially independent and move out with her children. At the class, she also met with counsellors who are trained to help domestic violence victims.  But India's 21-day lockdown, which began on 24 March, has put a stop to this. The classes have ended and it's impossible for community counsellors to visit vulnerable women.  Vimlesh Solanki, a volunteer for a Sambhali Trust, an organisation that supports women in Jodhpur, the second largest city in Rajasthan, says coronavirus has put women in danger. ""A complete lockdown means every day is completely disturbed. There are now no local grocers with carts so they need to travel further to the supermarket for food every day.  ""Stressful situations like this means that there are more things that trigger their already abusive partners."" Kai got out her phone and typed slowly. ""Mom wants me to stay with you."" She pressed send. A reply came quickly: ""That's fine."" Last week, the teenager stepped back inside the house she vowed she would never enter again. ""The second I walked back in my brain shut down,"" she says softly. ""Everything turned off, every feeling."" She had moved back in with her father, the man who she says physically and sexually abused her for years. Two weeks ago Kai thought coronavirus was something that would blow over with a passing news cycle. Then things changed. The staff at the shop where her mother worked were getting restless. News that the virus had crossed shores, spread to more than 170 countries and now reached New York, was making people nervous.  Working at a shop meant interacting with customers on a daily basis.  Kai's mum and her co-workers worried about contact with the customers, but they didn't have to worry for long. The shop announced it would close indefinitely and staff would be made redundant.  Kai's mother lost her $15-an-hour (£12) job and was told she would only have health insurance for five days. It began to take a toll on Kai's mother, who had suffered from mental health challenges most of Kai's life. ""She had an episode,"" says Kai. ""She shouted 'things are crazy here, you should go to your dad's house'"".  The words sent a cold pang of distress through Kai's veins. She retreated to her room, hoping that if she gave her mother some time things may blow over. But when she returned downstairs her mother simply said: ""Why are you still here?"" It was only a few months since Kai had started therapy for the years of physical and sexual abuse she had experienced with her father. She says he had abused her since she was a toddler. She still hadn't confided the full extent of the abuse to her mother and sister.  It was early days, but Kai says the therapy was helping her and she felt more in control. She was feeling more hopeful for the future. Then the shelter where she saw her therapist announced that the coronavirus outbreak meant it had to close. And last week, she moved back in with her father. ""He's here the whole time,"" she whispers, ""during the day he watches TV on his computer in the living room. At night I hear him watching porn."" She knows he's awake when she hears him making his breakfast smoothie. ""I hate it so much, it's so loud, the sound of the blender petrifies me. It's the start of my day, when I have to be vigilant."" Kai hasn't slept much since she moved back in, her door doesn't have a lock.  There was a routine to the physical abuse, it happened only when Kai did something to upset him. So she plans to stay out of his way and now only leaves her room to run to the bathroom and make herself something to eat in the kitchen.  The last time they were stuck together the house lost power and the abuse was particularly bad.  ""He acts like we are living through a strange time in history, but doesn't mention anything about the abuse,"" she says. ""That makes me feel like I'm going crazy. He hasn't done anything yet but the anticipation is killing me."" Kai spends all day online. Recently she's been watching YouTube video essays on movies. She enjoys watching analysis of films she's never seen.  She hopes that her mother will let her come back soon, or the coronavirus outbreak ends and she can find somewhere else to live. Nicole Jacobs, domestic abuse commissioner for England and Wales says police are ready to deal with a spike in domestic abuse calls.  ""We're trying to make sure people realise that the police are anticipating that domestic abuse will increase, that they're planning for that,"" she told the BBC. ""And they're very clear that these are prioritised calls. So you can make silent 999 calls by waiting for the call handler to pick up making some kind of a cough or any sound at all, and pressing 5,5."" She added that women with insecure immigration status should have ""all barriers removed, without fear of deportation, when reporting violence at this time"", with more funding for key workers in refuges. She also called for workers in social care and within specialist services to receive protective equipment during the virus outbreak. This is a sentiment echoed by Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, Executive Director of UN Women, who told the BBC that there's an urgent need for people working with vulnerable women to be given protective clothing. ""What we need is funding for field workers with PPE to reach communities and check in on vulnerable women. This needs to be a priority and there needs to be urgent global government funding for this."" She said that unlike the US and the UK, where national abuse hotlines have seen increased calls, the opposite will likely be the case in more developing countries. ""It is impossible for women from lower socio-economic backgrounds, in several countries, to report cases of domestic violence as they are living in one or two room homes with their abusers.  ""It was only in the months after the worst of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa where we learned of increases in gender-based violence at home."" Meanwhile, Ms Jacobs says now is the time for a proactive approach to dealing with domestic abuse in the UK.  ""We've heard about these vast amounts of people who are recruited to be NHS volunteers. We need to make sure that they have the information they need to spot domestic violence because they will be our eyes and ears out and about in the community."" The names of the two women have been changed. Illustrations by James Mobbs Translations by Rohan Nair Video edit by Yousef Eldin"
Yield Spread Sentiment,Uganda social media ban raises questions over regulation in Africa,2024-09-14,2021-01-15,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-55618994,"After Facebook's suspension of some Ugandan accounts, followed by the authorities' shutdown of social media and then the entire internet, the BBC's Dickens Olewe looks at the wider implications for Uganda, and elsewhere in Africa. Facebook has said it was trying to implement its rules but that is not how President Yoweri Museveni saw it. ""There is no way anybody can come [here] and play around with our country and decide who is good [and] who is bad,"" he said as he railed against the company's decision to remove accounts linked to the ruling National Resistance Movement (NRM) just days before Thursday's general election. The president accused Facebook, which he and other candidates had been using to campaign, of ""arrogance"".  His press secretary Don Wanyama, whose account was among those affected, told the BBC that the social media platform was being ""dictatorial"".  ""It is simply a platform, it should not morph into a political party. There must be regulation of these platforms and independent oversight bodies,"" Mr Wanyama said, adding that Uganda's communications commission should get involved to set a ""level playing field"". In a statement, Facebook said it acted after an investigation found that the accounts were involved in a coordinated effort to undermine political debate in the country.  Regardless of the merits of the case, analysts have told the BBC that popular social media platforms like Facebook need to pay attention to the context in which they are operating. They suggest that the companies should hire more people based on the continent and create an election response unit that works with civil society groups to enable them to tailor responses instead of relying on one-size-fits-all policies. Mr Wanyama accused leading opposition presidential candidate Robert Kyagulanyi - better known by his stage name Bobi Wine - of being behind the removal of the accounts. This was denied by researcher Tessa Knight from Digital Forensic Research Lab, whose investigation uncovered the coordinated campaigns by NRM targeting the opposition.  ""After I completed my investigation, I sent through the data to Facebook. They conducted their own, independent investigation and concluded that the network of accounts were engaged in Coordinated Inauthentic Behaviour (CIB) in an attempt to influence public debate ahead of the election,"" Ms Knight told the BBC, adding that she did not work with Bobi Wine as alleged.  CIB, as described by Facebook, is when groups of pages or people work together to mislead others about who they are or what they are doing while relying on fake accounts. In one instance, some of the accounts identified in the Uganda investigation posted exactly the same message on Facebook and Twitter, backing a police crackdown on opposition supporters: Late last year Facebook announced that it had uncovered similar attacks by France- and Russia-based accounts seeking to influence voters' opinions in the Central African Republic.  But according to Kenyan internet policy researcher Odanga Madung, banning the NRM-linked accounts exposed how sensitive the subject of content moderation can be and handed the Ugandan government the perfect excuse to do what it had already planned. ""Any casual observer of Ugandan politics expected the government to impose internet restrictions ahead of the elections, so Facebook's decision - especially the absence of tact when punishing infringements of its terms of service - offered Museveni a timely ruse to clothe the inevitable shutdown as a retaliation,"" said Mr Madung. ""What is clear from this fallout is that we'll see more of such collisions in Africa, especially in authoritarian countries, as social media companies come under pressure to implement their terms of service,"" he told the BBC. ""But I think this is an opportunity for Facebook and other platforms to increase their presence on the continent, beyond the few officials already here, and the fact-checking collaborations,"" Mr Madung said, adding that ""we must remember that these are private corporations so their profit motives comes first"".  Some commentators have noted that unlike in the US, where social media platforms banned a president, in Uganda it was the other way round. Popular Tanzanian cartoonist Gado artfully captured this sentiment.  In justifying the social media ban, the Ugandan government has mimicked the words of the social media companies. ""There has been a lot of misuse of social media to spread unfounded information that has been discrediting government officials... really if we are to practice democracy we need people to present facts as they are,"" minister Betty Amongi told the BBC. Political analyst Nanjala Nyabola, who has written extensively about technology in Africa, said the banning of US President Donald Trump from using the main social media platforms had opened a new phase in what had been a ""very fraught conversation"" internationally. She believes that the context in which the action is taken is crucial. ""The social network could take the exact same action in different places and the interpretation would be completely different.  ""It all depends on the pre-existing relationship between citizens and the government. In Uganda the government is saying that the ban is undemocratic but so is mass arrest and intimidation of opposition candidates. And the history of violence from the government against civilians changes the perception of the removal of these sites,"" she told the BBC. There has also been a history of the Ugandan government trying to limit the use of social media. In 2018 it introduced a controversial tax on the sites, which President Museveni defended as way of reducing ""gossip"" on the platforms.  The policy has instead made internet access more costly and resulted in the loss of revenue for telecoms companies.  The economic impact of the current internet restrictions will only compound the situation.  According to recent research by Top1OVPN looking at the cost of internet shutdowns in the year 2020, more than 50 million people in sub-Saharan Africa were affected by a shutdown, resulting in an economic cost of $237m (£173m). In Uganda, NetBlocks - which calculates the cost of internet shutdowns - estimates the country will lose at least $1.7m (£1.2m) a day, the amount is an aggregated cost of indirect losses as well as a direct consequence of businesses staying offline.  This also raises troubling questions about the relationship between social media companies and governments in places where there are moves towards greater regulation. Ms Nyabola is concerned that if there is a tightening of rules, then it could tilt the balance even more in favour of the state.  She added that social media companies now need to have a greater presence on the continent with local staff and a commitment to understand the social and political context to prevent the enforcement of their policies playing into the hands of authoritarian governments.  ""If these corporations know that their platforms are increasingly going to play a part in elections around the world then they need to have an election response unit,"" Ms Nyabola said. ""There shouldn't be a single rule but a flexible approach that can be rolled out in different contexts."" The social media platforms would argue that their rules apply equally to everyone, including presidents.  However, the global debate about their power and influence in moderating speech, and whether their policies should be universal, or are fair, will not end with Mr Museveni, or Mr Trump."
Yield Spread Sentiment,A seafaring people with five genders,2024-09-14,2021-04-12,Daniel Stables,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20210411-asias-isle-of-five-separate-genders,"The Bugis people of South Sulawesi are a powerful ethnic group remarkable for its recognition of five separate genders. But the future of their unique culture looks bleak. The Indonesian island of Sulawesi sprawls like a drunken starfish in the western Pacific Ocean, its four emerald limbs reaching into the Celebes, Molucca and Flores seas. On its south-western tip sits the smog-choked port city of Makassar, long an important trading post and Indonesia's eastern gateway to the world. In the grey dawn I stood on the waterfront and watched the curved prows of prahu sailing ships proceed elegantly into the chaos of Paotere Harbour, here to unload their bounty of sea cucumbers, cuttlefish and other strange creatures of the deep. These vessels belong to the Bugis people, a seafaring society remarkable for its recognition of five separate genders. ""The Bugis have words for five genders,"" explained Sharyn Graham Davies, an anthropologist at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, ""that map onto five ways of being in the world."" The Bugis are the largest ethnic group in South Sulawesi. Their heartland is in Makassar and the rice-growing countryside north of the city, but their prowess as seafarers and traders established their influence across Indonesia and the Malay Archipelago (and struck fear into the hearts of European colonisers, who regarded them as ruthless pirates). Despite only numbering around six million in a country of 270 million, the Bugis are highly influential: prominent examples include Jusuf Kalla, two-time vice president of Indonesia; and Najib Razak, former prime minister of Malaysia. ""The Bugis are among the strongest ethnic groups in the archipelago, politically, economically and culturally,"" said Sudirman Nasir, a Bugis who works in public health in South Sulawesi. Davies explained that in Bugis society, makkunrai and oroani correspond to Western concepts of cis female and cis male. Calalai are born with female bodies but take on traditionally male gender roles; they may wear shirts and trousers, smoke cigarettes, wear their hair short and work manual jobs. Calabai are born with male bodies but take on female gender roles, wearing dresses and makeup and growing their hair long. ""Many calabai work in beauty salons,"" said Neni, a calabai from the village of Segiri, north of Makassar. ""We also help to plan weddings and perform at wedding ceremonies."" You may also be interested in:  • The third gender of southern Mexico  • The tiny island traded for Manhattan  • The islands where women make the rules Calabai do not impersonate women, Davies explained, but exhibit their own suite of feminine behaviours that would be frowned upon in makkunrai women, like wearing miniskirts, smoking and acting in a more outwardly sexualised manner. Within Bugis society, calabai and calalai people may be disapproved of in some quarters, but they are widely tolerated, even seen as playing an important role in society, and are generally not attacked or otherwise persecuted by their own community. The fifth Bugis gender is bissu, which is considered neither male nor female but representative of the totality of the gender spectrum. Bissu, like calabai and calalai, display their identity through dress: they often wear flowers, a traditionally feminine symbol, but carry the keris dagger associated with men. Many bissu are born intersex, but the term has implications beyond biology. While Bugis gender is often described as a spectrum, bissu are deemed to be above this classification: spiritual beings who are not halfway between male and female, but rather embody the power of both at once. ""It is said that on their descent from heaven bissu did not split and become male or female, like most people,"" Davies explained, ""but remained a sacred unity of both."" As such, they are perceived as intermediaries between worlds and occupy a shaman-like role in Bugis religion. A serene old lady and a clucking chicken were my travel companions in a battered sky-blue bemo (public minibus) as I left Makassar behind. As we rattled north, jagged shards of limestone karst, tufted with jungle, lurched skyward from the surrounding rice paddies. It was planting season, and we passed a field where a mechanical plough was being pushed along, preceded by a ritualistic parade of bissu, recognisable by their robes of red, gold and green and their headdresses adorned with colourful flowers. We drove on. The evening sun began to glow like coal, and the Bugis farmers, bending to tend the rice fields, cast hunched and lengthening shadows. As darkness fell, we arrived in the town of Segiri, where I followed a throng of locals into a large wooden house. Five bissu were gathered in the centre of the room around a pile of rice. Fragrant incense smoke swirled in the near-darkness, and the sound of drums and chanting quickened to fever pitch as the bissu danced jerkily into a trance-like state. In unison, they unsheathed their keris daggers and began to stab the wavy blades into their own temples, palms, even their eyelids – seemingly not feeling any pain or barely even drawing a drop of blood. To undergo this ritual, known as ma'giri', and come through it unharmed is seen as proof that the bissu have been possessed by the gods and are ready to give blessings. This ceremony, like the parade in the rice field, was geared towards ensuring a bountiful harvest; good health and successful pregnancies are among other outcomes hoped for from a bissu blessing. ""Becoming bissu is a call of the soul,"" explained Eka, the head bissu in Segiri. ""We travel at an early age to study with a senior bissu, and learn our secret language, Basa To Ri Langiq (Language of the Heavens), which only we can understand."" In addition to granting blessings, Eka officiates at weddings. ""The Bugis treat us very well,"" Eka said. ""They have to, because we oversee all the Bugis customs."" Although their religious rituals and conception of gender are infused with pre-Islamic ideas, most Bugis are Muslims, many devoutly so. ""There were complex interactions between Bugis values and Islamic teaching,"" explained Nasir. ""This led to forms of Islamic-Bugis syncretism."" For example, as Davies explained, Bugis people often seek out bissu to bless a forthcoming hajj to Mecca. Many calalai and calabai struggle with their sexuality and sense of self, she also noted, believing that their lifestyle (which may include same-sex relations) is sinful according to Islamic belief, but also that they are the way they are because it was prescribed by Allah. For the same reason, they do not have a concept of being born in the wrong body; even though some calabai may undergo cosmetic procedures to make them look more feminine, they will not consider themselves to be women, as Davies discovered in her fieldwork. Islam began to predominate across Indonesia in the 1400s, but for centuries the local people reconciled their variegated perception of gender with the new faith. ""European sailors were writing about their reflections on gender diversity in South Sulawesi since at least the 1500s,"" Davies explained. In 1848, the British colonialist James Brooke wrote in his journal: ""The strangest custom I have observed is that some men dress like women, and some women like men; not occasionally, but all their lives, devoting themselves to the occupations and pursuits of their adopted sex."" Upon visiting South Sulawesi, Brooke was further surprised by the social equality he observed between women and men, a sentiment shared by his fellow imperialist Thomas Stanford Raffles. A third gender known as waria (a portmanteau of wanita, meaning woman, and pria, meaning man) has long been acknowledged in societies across Indonesia. Since the mid-20th Century, however, wider Indonesian society has become less tolerant of non-binary ideas of gender, which has resulted in persecution towards calabai and bissu people in particular. Beginning in the 1950s, a wave of violent attacks started against the LGBTQ community. ""When Kahar Muzakkar's Darul Islam rebellion movement wanted to establish an Islamic state in the 1950s, the bissu were arrested, tortured and forced to repent,"" said Nurhayatai Rahman Mattameng, a Bugis philologist. Some bissu had their heads shaved so they could be publicly shamed; some were killed. ""During the New Order era under President Suharto (1967-1998), there was an initiative called Operation Repentance,"" Mattameng added. ""All bissu people were forced to [renounce] To Latang, the ancestral religion of the Bugis, and choose one of the officially recognised religions in Indonesia instead."" In 2001, Islamic extremists burned down the Makassar headquarters of GAYa Celebes, a gay rights organisation. In 2018, the Jakarta Post reported that transgender women were being rounded up and placed in detention centres in Indonesia's capital city, as a ""deterrent"" to people identifying as waria. ""Bissu, calalai and calabai are experiencing a lot of stigma and discrimination, which is sadly increasing alongside the growing assertiveness of political Islam,"" said Nasir. ""At the societal level, there is a strong tendency towards an increased piety and puritanism, which could be compared to that of born-again Christians in the West. The future for these persecuted people is not very promising."" Eka agreed that the future looks bleak. ""The number of teachers with knowledge of the bissu ways is decreasing. So is people's interest in living as calabai,"" said Eka. ""In the future, bissu will be threatened with extinction."" Not everyone is so pessimistic about the future, however. There is help at hand in the form of Halilintar Lathief, a Bugis activist, artist and anthropologist. Lathief's organisation, Latar Nusa, is fighting to revitalise bissu and calabai culture by preserving traditional literature and empowering them to harness the economic benefits of their traditional ritual roles by seeking paid work as bridal makeup artists, wedding planners and caterers and medicinal shamans. ""In the early days, the trauma of persecution they had faced meant no-one wanted to become or claim to be bissu,"" Lathief said. ""They were afraid of being arrested or killed; some were ashamed. Now, after several years, there are many more people who identify as calabai, and more who are proud to be called bissu.""

Yield Spread Sentiment,The teenage gamers earning six figures,2024-09-14,2018-03-23,Bryan Lufkin,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20180323-how-video-games-make-some-teens-millionaires,"From making their own games, to broadcasting live online, to playing professionally in packed stadiums – how entrepreneurs in their teens and twenties earn a living on video games. Alex Balfanz is an 18-year-old student at Duke University in North Carolina. Every day he has lectures or seminars, followed by assignments. Like many students his age, he devotes a couple of hours per day, and many more at weekends, to video games. But he’s not just playing them – he’s making them. And making a lot of money doing it. “In the 10 months that Jailbreak has been released, it has already yielded seven figure profits,” Balfanz says of his cops-and-robbers adventure game released last year. A few weeks ago, it was played for the billionth time. Balfanz is just one of thousands of young gaming entrepreneurs in their teens or twenties making money in an industry that made $36 billion last year. It's offering new ways to make a living that didn’t exist 10 or even five years ago, even within the games industry. Another 18-year-old student, Andrew Bereza, is the creator of Miner’s Haven and Azure Mines, two games he made over the last two years for Roblox, a kids-focused platform that allows children to build their own games and publish them online – it's the same platform that houses Balfanz’s Jailbreak. “While I’m not in the annual millions like a couple of my colleagues have recently hit, I’ve been steadily earning six figures every year since I started,” he says. He is using his earnings to pay for university, where he is studying computer science. If he didn’t have a platform to distribute his games, “I don’t know how I ever would have been able to afford college or the ability to do full-time game development”, he says. Making and selling your own games Today, thanks to online sales platforms like the App Store, Steam or Roblox, anyone with the right idea and some development nous can reach more than a billion people. But while the technology and ecosystem to reach this vast customer base has only appeared in the last decade, the DIY mentality of young app developers is nothing new: it’s actually not too different from wannabe rock stars starting bands in their garages in the 1970s, or aspiring directors filming home movies on a VHS camcorder in the 1980s. “With creative industries, that’s always been the case, particularly in young people,” says Roger Altizer, co-founder of the entertainment arts and engineering programme at the University of Utah. He says that young people have always come up with creative expressions and have tried to monetise them. With video games specifically, Altizer points out that in the 1980s, young designers made their own video games, stored them on floppy disks and put them in plastic bags, then sold them physically at stores, capturing a certain entrepreneurial spirit. Today? We have indie games like Flappy Bird that become worldwide sensations, achieving overnight success. However, there are now so many being published, it’s becoming an ever-more crowded market. Still, the idea of possible success in this field fuels dreams. Anthony Tan is a high-school student in Australia whose surreal adventure game, Way to the Woods, is due out next year, and has already generated a lot of excitement among games journalists. “You play as a deer and their fawn trying to find their way home in a sleepy, abandoned world,” Tan says. “I think I’d like to go to uni after my completing my current project,” says 18-year-old Tan, who “started off making crappy little Flash games on the side for fun in about Year 8 or 9.” While not everyone is going to make millions off their own game, it still scratches an entrepreneurial itch, Tan says: “Video games are fun for me because I get to dip my toes into all of those fields: creating, designing, modelling, sculpting, painting, engineering, composing.” ‘Serious games’ to promote a cause A lot of young people have used this democratisation of resources to be innovative in a particular way: promoting ideas to improve society. Games that touch on gender identity, cultural politics or mental health care. As a concept, this isn’t new, either. The World Food Programme released what it described as “the world’s first humanitarian video game” nearly 13 years ago: called Food Force, it was released in seven languages and aimed to teach kids about world hunger. But what is new is that young budding video game developers are doing this on their own, and even pursuing careers doing so at university. “We have people coming to school to make serious games because they want to make games that make a difference,” Altizer says. Altizer himself does this at the Therapeutic Games and Apps lab at the University of Utah, which focuses on creating games that help spinal cord injury patients do exercises that prevent pressure sores from wheelchair use, or games that give social workers VR tours of fictional homes to spot dangers for children inside. The internet doesn’t just allow today’s teens and young adults to make their own games to spread a message, though: a charismatic few are using it to make a living as performers. Streaming online in front of millions A relatively new way of making money is by playing video games – and getting strangers on the internet to watch you do it. “Let’s Play” videos, in which an online personality films themselves playing a video game as they add colour commentary for viewers, is a trend that grew so popular, it eventually led to a new platform, Twitch – an entire site devoted to streaming videos of other people playing video games. It is now one of the most popular websites on the internet globally, and was bought by Amazon in 2014 for nearly $1 billion. Being a streamer on a place like Twitch requires entrepreneurial skills, scrappiness and a tolerance for risk. Elspeth Eastman, a Twitch streamer with 103,000 followers, says that after university she spent $2,000 on a new computer to try her hand at streaming. Today, she says she makes a living doing what she loves full-time. “Right now, I’m sitting in a room that’s 90% wires and computers,” Eastman says over the phone from her filming studio. “It’s absolutely your own business. You have to do everything at once: you’re the lights guy, and you’re also the person on stage.” Eventually, it can lead to advertising partnerships, or paid subscriptions, with a cut of the funds going to the streamers. But for a lot of newer streamers, it’s asking for donations from subscribers. It takes a while to get enough viewers to be able to monetise. “This patronage model where people would sponsor artists is very common,” Altizer says. Eastman and another streamer, who goes by Valkyrae who has 200,000 followers and has had a full-time job streaming for three years, point to the importance of networking and self-promoting yourself on social media, or filming videos with streamers who have more subscribers than you. And like DIY app development, the community-centred nature of streaming can also drive a greater good. Valkyrae mentions a charity stream that she participated in last Christmas that raised $8,700 in six hours for St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. “One of my subscribers had cancer and he needed surgery,” she says. “And we raised enough money for his surgery, which was like $8,000. You can help people financially – I’m helping my mum financially because of all this extra income I’m getting.” Professional video game players But perhaps the most ambitious – and lucrative – avenue to success that didn’t exist in the mainstream a decade ago is the rise of the professional video game player. Many of these people are in their 20s or younger. The sport is estimated to attract 600 million viewers and be worth £1 billion ($1.4bn) by 2020. The International Olympics Committee is even thinking about adding it to the official roster of events. Sumail Hassan is the youngest gamer to win $1 million in eSports winnings. He’s made more than $2.5 million playing Dota, an online multiplayer game. He calls it a full-time job. “ESports have only gotten bigger since my career started in 2015,” Hassan says. He’s 19 now but has been gaming since he was seven. “I knew video games were the thing I was best at and so went pro.” Altizer says that the University of Utah offers eSports scholarships, and that the university has a varsity eSports programme that pits players against each other in games like League of Legends and Overwatch. Like professional athletes, the chances of becoming a world-renowned eSports player are very slim. “It might not be a path to fame and riches of winning the international tournament. That’s the same thing as going to school and playing lacrosse – there aren’t many people making millions of dollars as lacrosse players,” Altizer says. Hassan says he’s going to stay focused on his gaming career for now, but advises others looking to follow in his footsteps to stay in school and get an education. (This is a sentiment echoed by streamers Eastman and Valkyrae.) “Don’t bet on making a living playing games,” Hassan says. Plans for the future? Whether it’s eSports, streaming or developing indie video games out of your bedroom, the games industry has evolved rapidly over the last couple of decades, and many of these new career paths were born alongside the growth of the internet. Being successful here calls upon lots of skills beyond computer programming: having a bubbly on-air personality, marketing yourself on social media and more. But most won’t end up in a big studio making the next Call of Duty, or becoming the next champion World of Warcraft player, or a Twitch streamer with millions of followers. And that’s not a bad thing, because young people today have more opportunities to enter the industry. Altizer likens it to music: “There are probably more people working in the industry supporting music rather than making money as musicians,” he says. “It’s easier to get a job at the music store tuning guitars than opening for a band on stage.” -- Bryan Lufkin is BBC Capital’s features writer.

Yield Spread Sentiment,How the Plague made the rich richer,2024-09-14,2020-07-02,"Eleanor Russell, University of Cambridge and Martin Parker, University of Bristol",https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200701-how-the-black-death-make-the-rich-richer,"When a third of Europe’s population was lost, wealth concentrated into tiny groups. Could Covid-19 trigger something similar? This article originally appeared on The Conversation, and is republished under a Creative Commons licence. In June 1348, people in England began reporting mysterious symptoms. They started off as mild and vague: headaches, aches, and nausea. This was followed by painful black lumps, or buboes, growing in the armpits and groin, which gave the disease its name: bubonic plague. The last stage was a high fever, and then death. Originating in Central Asia, soldiers and caravans had brought bubonic plague – Yersina pestis, a bacterium carried on fleas that lived on rats – to ports on the Black Sea. The highly commercialised world of the Mediterranean ensured the plague’s swift transfer on merchant ships to Italy, and then across Europe. The Black Death killed between a third and a half of the population of Europe and the Near East. This huge number of deaths was accompanied by general economic devastation. With a third of the workforce dead, the crops could not be harvested and communities fell apart. One in ten villages in England (and in Tuscany and other regions) were lost and never re-founded. Houses fell into the ground and were covered by grass and earth, leaving only the church behind. If you ever see a church or chapel all alone in a field, you are probably looking at the last remains of one of Europe’s lost villages. The traumatic experience of the Black Death, which killed perhaps 80% of those who caught it, drove many people to write in an attempt to make sense of what they had lived through. In Aberdeen, John of Fordun, a Scottish chronicler, recorded that: This sickness befell people everywhere, but especially the middling and lower classes, rarely the great. It generated such horror that children did not dare to visit their dying parents, nor parents their children, but fled for fear of contagion as if from leprosy or a serpent. These lines could almost have been written today. Although the death rate from Covid-19 is far lower than that of the Black Death, the economic fallout has been severe due to the globalised, highly-integrated nature of modern economies. Add to this our highly mobile populations today and coronavirus, unlike the plague, has spread across the globe in a matter of months, not years. While the Black Death resulted in short term economic damage, the longer-term consequences were less obvious. Before the plague erupted, several centuries of population growth had produced a labour surplus, which was abruptly replaced with a labour shortage when many serfs and free peasants died. Historians have argued that this labour shortage allowed those peasants that survived the pandemic to demand better pay or to seek employment elsewhere. Despite government resistance, serfdom and the feudal system itself were ultimately eroded. But another less often remarked consequence of the Black Death was the rise of wealthy entrepreneurs and business-government links. Although the Black Death caused short-term losses for Europe’s largest companies, in the long term, they concentrated their assets and gained a greater share of the market and influence with governments. This has strong parallels with the current situation in many countries across the world. While small companies rely upon government support to prevent them collapsing, many others – mainly the much larger ones involved in home delivery – are profiting handsomely from the new trading conditions. The mid-14th Century economy is too removed from the size, speed, and interconnectedness of the modern market to give exact comparisons. But we can certainly see parallels with the way that the Black Death strengthened the power of the state and accelerated the domination of key markets by a handful of large companies. Black Death business The sudden loss of at least a third of Europe’s population led to a redistribution of wealth for everyone else. In the longer term, however, people responded to the devastation by keeping money within the family. Wills became highly specific and wealthy businessmen, in particular, went to great lengths to ensure that their patrimony was no longer divided up after death, replacing the previous tendency to leave a third of all their resources to charity. Their descendants benefited from a continued concentration of capital into a smaller and smaller number of hands. At the same time, the decline of feudalism and the rise of a wage-based economy following peasant demands for better labour conditions benefited urban elites. Being paid in cash, rather than in kind (in the granting of privileges such as the right to collect firewood), meant that peasants had more money to spend in towns. This concentration of wealth greatly accelerated a pre-existing trend: the emergence of merchant entrepreneurs who combined trade in goods with their production on a scale only available to those with significant sums of capital. For example, silk, once imported from Asia and Byzantium, was now being produced in Europe. Wealthy Italian merchants began to open silk and cloth workshops. These entrepreneurs were uniquely positioned to respond to the sudden labour shortage caused by the Black Death. Unlike independent weavers, who lacked the capital, and unlike aristocrats, whose wealth was locked up in land, urban entrepreneurs were able to use their liquid capital to invest in new technologies, compensating for the loss of workers with machines. In southern Germany, which became one of Europe’s most commercialised areas in the late 14th and 15th centuries, companies such as the Welser (which later ran Venezuela as a private colony) combined growing flax with owning the looms on which workers span that flax into linen cloth, which the Welser then sold. The broad trend of the post-Black Death 14th and 15th centuries was a concentration of resources – capital, skills, and infrastructure – into the hands of a small number of large companies. The age of Amazon Rolling forward to the present, there are some clear similarities. Certain large organisations have stepped up to the opportunities provided by Covid-19. In many countries across the world, entire ecologies of small restaurants, pubs and shops have suddenly been closed down. The market for food, general retail and entertainment has gone online, and cash has pretty much disappeared. The percentage of calories that restaurants provided has had to be rerouted through supermarkets, and much of this supply has now been taken up by supermarket chains. They have plenty of large properties and lots of staff, with the HR capacity to recruit more rapidly, and there are many underemployed people who now want jobs. They also have warehouses, trucks and complex logistics capacity. The other big winner has been the giants of online retail – such as Amazon, who run a “Prime Pantry” service in the US, India and many European countries. High street shops have been suffering from price and convenience competition from the internet for years, and bankruptcies are regular news. Now, much “non-essential” retail space is closed, and our desires have been re-rerouted through Amazon, eBay, Argos, Screwfix and others. There has been a clear spike in online shopping, and retail analysts are wondering whether this is a decisive move into the virtual world, and the further dominance of big companies. Keeping us distracted as we wait at home for our parcels is the streaming entertainment industry – a market sector which is dominated by large companies including Netflix, Amazon Prime (again), Disney and others. Other online giants such as Google (which owns YouTube), Facebook (which owns Instagram) and Twitter provide the other platforms that dominate online traffic. The final link in the chain is the delivery companies themselves: UPS, FedEx, Amazon Logistics (again), as well as food delivery from Just Eat and Deliveroo. Through their business models are different, their platforms now dominate the movements of products of all kinds, whether your new Toshiba branded Amazon Fire TV, or your stuffed crust from Pizza Hut (a subsidiary of Yum! Brands, which also owns KFC, Taco Bell and others). The other swing to corporate dominance has been the move away from state-backed cash towards contactless payment services. It’s obviously a corollary of online marketplaces, but also means that the money moves though large companies that take their slice for moving it. Visa and Mastercard are the largest players, but Apple Pay, PayPal, and Amazon Pay (again) have all seen increases in their transaction volume as cash sits unused in people’s purses. And if cash is still imagined to be a vector for transmission, then retailers won’t take it and customers won’t use it. Small business has taken a really decisive hit across a wide range of sectors as Covid-19, like the Black Death, results in big companies gaining market share. Even those working at home to write pieces like this are working on Skype (owned by Microsoft), Zoom and BlueJeans, as well using email clients and laptops made by a small number of global organisations. Billionaires are getting richer while ordinary people lose their jobs. Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s CEO, has increased his wealth by US$25 billion since the start of the year. But this is not the whole story. The other big trend in the response to the virus has been the strengthening of the power of the state. Governing pandemics At a state level, the Black Death caused the acceleration of trends towards centralisation, the growth of taxation, and government dependence upon large companies. In England, the declining value of land and consequent falls in revenue prompted the crown – the country’s biggest landowner – to attempt to cap wages at pre-plague levels with the 1351 Statute of Labourers, and to impose additional taxes upon the populace. Previously, the government was expected to fund itself, only imposing taxes for extraordinary expenses such as wars. But the post-plague taxes set a major precedent for government intervention in the economy. These governmental efforts were a significant increase in the crown’s involvement in people’s daily lives. In subsequent plague outbreaks, which occurred every 20 years or so, movement began to be restricted through curfews, travel bans, and quarantines. This was part of a general concentration of state power and the replacement of the previous regional distribution of authority with a centralised bureaucracy. Many of the men running the post-plague administration, such as the poet Geoffrey Chaucer, were drawn from English merchant families, some of which gained significant political power. The most outstanding example of this was the de la Pole family, who in two generations went from being Hull wool merchants to earls of Suffolk. With the temporary collapse of international trade and finance after the Black Death, Richard de la Pole became the crown’s greatest lender and an intimate of Richard II. When Italian mega-companies re-emerged in the late 14th and 15th Centuries, they also benefited from the crown’s ever-growing reliance upon merchant companies. The Medici family, who eventually came to rule Florence, are the most striking example. Merchants also gained political influence by purchasing land, the price of which had fallen after the Black Death. Land ownership allowed merchants to enter the land-based gentry or even the aristocracy, marrying their children to the sons and daughters of cash-strapped lords. With their new status, and with the help of influential in-laws, the urban elites gained political representation within parliament. By the end of the 14th Century, the government’s extension of state control and its continued ties to merchant companies drove many nobles to turn against Richard II. They transferred their allegiance to his cousin, who became Henry IV, in the (vain) hope that he would not follow Richard’s policies. This, and the subsequent Wars of the Roses, generally depicted as a clash between the Yorkists and the Lancastrians, were actually partly driven by the nobility’s hostility towards the centralisation of government power. Henry Tudor’s defeat of Richard III in 1485 ended not only the war but also quashed any further attempts by the English baronage to regain regional authority, paving the way for the continued rise of companies and central government. The state we are in The power of the state is something that we largely assume in the 21st Century. Across the world, the idea of the sovereign nation has been central to the imperial politics and economy of the last few centuries. But from the 1970s onwards, it became common among intellectuals to suggest that the state was less important, its monopoly of control within a given territory contested by multinational corporations. In 2016, of the largest 100 economic entities, 31 were countries and 69 were companies. Walmart was larger than the economy of Spain, Toyota larger than India. The capacity of these large companies to influence politicians and regulators has been clear enough: consider the effects of oil companies on climate change denial. And since Margaret Thatcher, prime minister of the UK from 1979 to 1990, pronounced that she intended to “roll back the state”, more and more parts of previously state-owned assets now operate as companies, or as players in state engineered quasi-markets. Roughly 25% of the UK’s National Health Service, for example, is delivered through contracts with the private sector. Across the globe, transport, utilities, telecommunications, dentists, opticians, the post office and many other services used to be state monopolies and are now run by profit-making companies. Nationalised, or state owned, industries are often described as slow, and in need of market discipline in order to become more modern and efficient. But thanks to coronavirus, the state has come rolling back in again like a tsunami. Spending on a level which was mocked as “magic money tree” economics only a few months ago has been aimed at national health systems, addressed the problem of homelessness, provided universal basic income for millions of people, and offered loan guarantees or direct payments to a host of businesses. This is Keynesian economics on a grand scale, in which national bonds are used to borrow money backed by future income from taxpayers. Ideas about balancing the budget appear to, for now, be history, with entire industries now being reliant on treasury bailouts. Politicians the world over have suddenly become interventionist, with wartime metaphors being used to justify gigantic spending. Less often remarked is the astonishing restriction on personal freedoms. The autonomy of the individual is central to neoliberal ideas. “Freedom loving peoples” are contrasted with those who live their lives under the yoke of tyranny, of states that exercise Big Brother surveillance powers over their citizens behaviour. Yet in the last few months, states around the world have effectively restricted movement for the vast majority of people and are using the police and armed forces to prevent assembly in public and private spaces. Theatres, pubs and restaurants are closed by fiat, parks have been locked, and sitting on benches can get you a fine. Running too close to someone will get you shouted at by someone in a high vis vest. A medieval king would have been impressed with this level of authoritarianism. The pandemic seems to have allowed the fiscal and administrative powers of big government to bulldozer arguments about prudence and liberty. The state’s power is now being exercised in ways that haven’t been seen since the second world war, and there has been widespread public support. Popular resistance To return to the Black Death, the growth in wealth and influence of merchants and big business seriously aggravated existing anti-mercantile sentiment. Medieval thought – both intellectual and popular – held that trade was morally suspect and that merchants, especially wealthy ones, were prone to avarice. The Black Death was widely interpreted as a punishment from God for Europe’s sinfulness, and many post-plague writers blamed the church, governments, and wealthy companies for Christendom’s moral decline. William Langland’s famous protest poem Piers Plowman was strongly anti-mercantilist. Other works, such as the mid-15th Century poem the Libelle of Englysche Polycye, tolerated trade but wanted it in the hands of English merchants and out of the control of Italians, whom the author argued impoverished the country. As the 14th and 15th Centuries progressed and large companies gained a greater share of the market, popular and intellectual hostility grew. In the longer term, this was to have incendiary results. By the 16th Century, the concentration of trade and finance into the hands of large companies had evolved into a near-monopoly upon royal and papal banking by a small number of companies who also held monopolies or near-monopolies over Europe’s major commodities – such as silver, copper, and mercury – and imports from Asia and the Americas, especially spices. Martin Luther was incensed by this concentration and especially the Catholic Church’s use of monopolistic firms to collect indulgences. In 1524, Luther published a tract arguing that trade should be for the common (German) good and that merchants should not charge high prices. Along with other Protestant writers, such as Philip Melancthon and Ulrich von Hutten, Luther drew upon existing anti-mercantile sentiment to criticise the influence of business over government, adding financial injustice to their call for religious reform. The sociologist Max Weber famously associated Protestantism with the emergence of capitalism and modern economic thought. But early Protestant writers opposed monopolistic companies and the commercialisation of everyday life, drawing upon anti-mercantile sentiment that had its roots in the Black Death. This popular and religious opposition eventually led to the break from Rome and the transformation of Europe. Is small always beautiful? By the 21st Century we have become used to the idea that capitalist firms produce concentrations of wealth. Whether Victorian industrialists, US robber barons or dot com billionaires, the inequalities generated by business and its corrupting influence over governments have shaped discussion of commerce since the industrial revolution. For critics, big business has often been characterised as heartless, a behemoth that crushes ordinary people in the wheels of its machines, or vampirically extracts the profits of labour from the labouring classes. As we have seen, the arguments between small business localists and those who favour corporations and the power of the state date back many centuries. Romantic poets and radicals bemoaned the way that the “dark satanic mills” were destroying the countryside and producing people who were no more than appendages to machines. The idea that the honest craftsman was being replaced by the alienated employee, a wage slave, is common to both nostalgic and progressive critics of early capitalism. By the 1960s, the idea that there was some fundamental difference between small and large forms of business added environmentalism to these longstanding arguments. “The man” in his skyscraper was opposed to the more authentic artisan. This faith in local business combined with a suspicion of corporations and the state have flowed into the green, Occupy and Extinction Rebellion movements. Eating local food, using local money, and trying to tilt the purchasing power of “anchor institutions” like hospitals and universities towards small social enterprises has become the common sense of many contemporary economic activists. But the Covid-19 crisis questions this small is good, big is bad dichotomy in some very fundamental ways. Large scale organising has appeared to be necessary to deal with the huge range of issues that the virus has thrown up, and the states that appear to have been most successful are those which have adopted the most interventionist forms of surveillance and control. Even the most ardent post-capitalist would have to admit that small social enterprises could not fit out a gigantic hospital in a few weeks. And though there are plenty of examples of local businesses engaging in food delivery, and a commendable amount of mutual aid taking place, the population of the global north is largely being fed by large supermarket chains with complex logistics operations. After coronavirus The long-term result of the Black Death was the strengthening of the power of big business and the state. The same processes are happening much more rapidly during the coronavirus lockdown. But we should be cautious of easy historical lessons. History never really repeats itself. The circumstances of each time are unique, and it simply isn’t wise to treat the “lesson” of history as if it were a series of experiments that prove certain general laws. And Covid-19 will not kill a third of any population, so though its effects are profound, they will not result in the same shortage of working people. If anything, it has actually strengthened the power of employers. The most profound difference is that the virus comes in the middle of another crisis, that of climate change. There is a real danger that the policy of bouncing back to a growth economy will simply overwhelm the necessity of reducing carbon emissions. This is the nightmare scenario, one in which Covid-19 is just a prequel to something much worse. But the huge mobilisations of people and money which governments and large companies have deployed also shows that big organisations can reshape themselves and the world extraordinarily rapidly if they wish. This gives real grounds for optimism concerning our collective capacity to re-engineer energy production, transport, food systems and much else – the green new deal which many policy makers have been sponsoring. The Black Death and Covid-19 seem to have both caused concentration and centralisation of business and state power. That is interesting to note. But the biggest question is whether these potent forces can be aimed at the crisis to come.

Yield Spread Sentiment,50 ‘grand challenges’ for the world,2024-09-14,2017-04-01,Bryan Lufkin,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20170331-50-grand-challenges-for-the-21st-century,"We asked experts from the world of science and technology to describe the societal challenges that they think matter in 2017 and beyond. Read the full list of responses below. Over the past month, Future Now has been covering the “grand challenges” we face as a society in a series of articles, videos and graphics. We polled a panel of people from various fields about the vital issues they believe deserve more attention – you can browse 50 of those responses below, which we’ll continue to draw on throughout this year. There’s a lot to digest in one sitting – so dip in, reflect, come back... You can also catch up on the stories inspired by these responses that we’ve published to date here: The Grand Challenges. * * * danah boyd, Principal Researcher at Microsoft Research Data-driven technologies are increasingly being integrated into many different parts of society, from judicial decision-making processes to automated vehicles to the dissemination of news. Each of these implementations raises serious questions about what values are being implemented and to whom these implementations are accountable. There is increasing desire by regulators, civil society, and social theorists to see these technologies be “fair” and “ethical,” but these concepts are fuzzy at best. Meanwhile, there are significant trade-offs and local decisions that technical actors face on a day-to-day basis that shape the very structure of these systems. Developing responsible sociotechnical systems will require bridging the social-technical gap that can easily emerge as social actors and technical actors speak past one another. Missy Cummings, Professor, Humans and Autonomy Lab, Duke University I think one of the most important challenges faced by robotic systems of the future, which include driverless cars, drones, surgical and manufacturing robots, is how will we be able to certify these systems as safe, particularly those that embed artificial intelligence? By their very nature, artificial intelligence algorithms reason probabilistically and as uncertainty increases in the world, uncertainty increases in an algorithm’s ability to successfully and safely come to a solution. Presently we have no commonly-accepted approaches and without an industry standard for testing such stochastic systems, it is difficult for these technologies to be widely implemented. Kate Darling, Research Specialist at MIT Media Lab. Fellow at the Harvard Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society Companies are going to follow their market incentives. That’s not a bad thing, but we can’t rely on them just to be ethical for the sake of it, for the most part. It helps to have regulation in place. We’ve seen this in privacy, or whenever we have a new technology, and we figure out how to deal with it. Ezekiel Emanuel, Vice Provost for Global Initiatives and chair of the Department of Medical Ethics and Health Policy at the University of Pennsylvania I think one of the big issues is going to be unemployment: automation, artificial intelligence, virtual reality. It seems pretty inevitable it’s going to create displacement of workers, ie unemployment. If you look at what gives people meaning in their lives, it’s three things: meaningful relationships, passionate interests, and meaningful work. Meaningful work is a very important element of someone’s identity. Viktor Mayer Schonberger, Professor of Internet Governance and Regulation, Oxford Internet Institute My #1 issue is not the future of democracy (or related issues such as fake news, Trump, social networking bubbles, or even cybersecurity), but the future of humanity. As we are developing more and more ways to let computers take over reasoning through adaptive learning, we are faced with an existential question: what is it – long term – that makes us human? It used to be doing calculus, playing Chess (or Go), flying airplanes, driving cars, having a conversation, playing Jeopardy, or cooking (to name a few). What if data-driven, learning algorithms can do all that? What’s the essence of being human – is it radical creativity, irrational originality, craziness and illogicality? And if so, are we then shaping our learning institutions to help humans develop and nurture exactly these skills (our competitive advantages). In short, for me 2017 marks the year, when intra-human problems slowly begin to pale when compared to this more fundamental and existential one. Peter Norvig, Director of Research, Google Artificial intelligence has proven to be quite effective at practical tasks – from labeling photos, to understanding speech and written natural language, to helping identify diseases. The challenge now is to make sure everyone benefits from this technology. It's important that machine learning be researched openly, and spread via open publications and open source code, so we can all share in the rewards. Richard Alan Peters, Associate Professor of Electrical Engineering, Vanderbilt University In my opinion, the most important breakthrough in robotics and AI to come is the learning of concepts by learning sensory-motor coordination. An intelligent agent (animal or robot) that can manipulate the physical world while sensing the results of said manipulation forms one half of a complex dynamical system. The other half is the world. Complex dynamical systems form patterns in nature. In the case of an animal (including humans) that pattern occurs in the brain and spinal cord system. It relates sensing to action and vice-versa. In a robot, I like to call this “natural intelligence” to distinguish it from artificial intelligence which is usually acquired by a disembodied computer. Among other things this approach solves the symbol grounding problem (how an agent’s internal symbols relate to the physical world. This has been puzzled over since Aristotle.) And it solves the “frame problem” by providing a physical context for deliberative thought. AI, although very useful, will never approach human intelligence until it is embodied. That is, of course, a hypothesis, a conjecture that has yet to be proven. But I believe we are close. These ideas were first set down by Rodney Brooks at MIT in the 1980’s. Brooks hypothesis is Intelligence is an emergent phenomenon that is the result of embodiment, situatedness, development and interaction. Bruce Schneier, international security technologist The Internet of Things is giving computers the ability to affect the world in a direct physical manner. As this happens to more and more things, the particular ways in which computers fail will become the way everything fails. This means more catastrophic failures, as bugs and vulnerabilities affect every instance of a piece of software. This will completely change how we think about the risks of computerised cars, computerised appliances, computerised everything. Tomotaka Takahashi, founder of Kyoto University’s Robo Garage In 2017, cloud funding and hardware start ups are going to collapse. Because of the fake demo videos, people’s expectations to technology is getting too high, and no product can satisfy them. Only a few strong companies and products, such as Amazon Echo, can survive. I believe people are going to demand Echo with more humanity and portability, and social robots like RoBoHoN will find its market in five years. Jonathan Zittrain, Professor of International Law at Harvard Law School and the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, Professor of Computer Science at the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Director of the Harvard Law School Library, and Faculty Director of the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society I'm concerned about the reduction of human autonomy as our systems -- aided by technology -- become more complex and tightly coupled. Artificial intelligence is making some real progress right now, and our work is less to worry about a science fiction robot takeover, and more to see how technology can be used to help with human reflection and decisionmaking rather than to entirely substitute for it. If we ""set it and forget it,"" we may rue how a system evolves, and that there is no clear place for an ethical dimension to be considered. Mary Barra, CEO, General Motors The auto industry stands at an inflection point where rapidly advancing technology and evolving customer needs offer a unique opportunity to transform our relationship with customers, communities and the environment. Thanks to connectivity, electrification, autonomous vehicles and car- and ridesharing, the way customers interact with our vehicles is going to change in a way that hasn't happened since the industry was born more than 100 years ago. Some view this as a disruption – we believe it represents a tremendous opportunity to make people’s lives safer, simpler and better. Realising these changes demands the ability to recruit from a talented pool of diverse candidates with Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) expertise. Today, there is more demand for some STEM areas than there is available new talent and the demand continues to grow. It’s one of the reasons we are committed to doing all we can to encourage young people to pursue careers in STEM, particularly in Technology and Engineering. Nootan Bharani, Lead Design Manager, Place Lab – ‎Place Lab, University of Chicago A pivot from just climate change to segregation. Specifically, the widening gap between wealthy and impoverished people, worldwide. Climate change is a causal factor in the increased(ing) disparity. So too are racism and classism. Climate change exacerbates the challenges thrust upon impoverished people. The use and habitation of spaces demonstrates this clearly – the quantity, quality, and increasingly, the ability of one’s space to protect from harsher and unexpected elements. Solutions should be structural as well as grass roots. Sound policy as well as micro-local community-based. Intentional systems got us into this pickle, and intentional systems will need to be part of the process to reach toward common vision and goals. Scratching the surface are programmes offered by governments and utilities, to assist homeowners to weatherise their structures. Impoverished communities still lack the resource/capacity to capture full use of technologies – methods are already known and commonplace in sustainable new construction. The most robust and innovative energy efficiency programs are yet to benefit those that would feel the greatest impact from the captured savings. Culture is intersectional, is an arbiter. Culture is part of the solution to finding common ground between wealthy and impoverished (and all in-between). Vernacular architectures are expressions of the people and culture in a particular locale, in particular climates. My “dream” of seeing more vernacular architecture overlapped with contemporary design is a desire to see cultural identities expressed as much as it is a desire to see climate adaptive solutions for space. Larry Burns, former corporate vice president of Research and Development for General Motors According to the World Health Organisation, over 1.2 million people a year die from crashes on the world’s roadways. This is epidemic in scale. Traffic safety experts predict that over 90% of roadway fatalities can be eliminated when driverless vehicle technology reaches its full potential. Regulators, police organisations and liability experts responsibly caution that we cannot let driverless technology get in front of safety. However, like with all epidemics, we also have a responsibility to realise the full potential of cures as soon as possible. While we must be prudent, we also must not let those with vested interests in human driven cars slow progress. We must work together to safely accelerate the realisation of driverless vehicles. Reaching this imperative one-day sooner could save over 3,000 lives! Vishaan Chakrabarti, Associate Professor of Practice at Columbia Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation The major new challenge for the fields of architecture and urbanism will be to build what I call the ""Public Metropolis,"" which means cities that are more ecologically sound, more equitable, more humane in their deployment of technology, more intense in their creation of new infrastructure, and more fervent in their roles as beacons for a free, diverse and open global society in a time when nativism and fascism are on the rise. The debate of whether to build dense, transit-based cities as the most environmentally sound growth model in a world in which billions are reaching the middle class is largely settled: the question that remains is not whether to build better cities, but how. Great civic architecture for both public and private projects will be pivotal to this question by enabling the creation of new cultural buildings, commercial projects, and infrastructures that read and write with the specifics of a place, so that we maintain local identities in a global world. Lucy Jones, Science Advisor for Risk Reduction for the United States Geological Survey We do a great job as a society of funding and supporting innovative research – we really admire that aspect of it. What we do a very bad job at is making the interface between that esoteric research and how people can actually use the information. People want predictions (for earthquakes). But people have to understand the scientific process. That’s problem number one: The communication phase. People on the outside turn to us (researchers) for answers, and we are so caught up in the scientific process that we know no answer that we’re talking about is final. There’s this gap that we’re not helping people understand, and it’s actively discouraged – if you have a young scientist who’s brilliant on TV explaining earthquakes, they may say no, I’m not going to do this because it’s going to hurt my career. Rochelle Kopp, founder and Managing Principal of Japan Intercultural Counseling I would say that one of the biggest challenges for the 21st Century as relates to Japan and Asia, and indeed the rest of the world, is related to questions of immigration (which includes refugee issues). These have of course received a lot of attention in the media, but the discussions are often stuck at a basic level, and governmental policies and programs are often not sufficiently addressing the issues. Specifically as for Asia: Japan, as well as Korea and China, are rapidly ageing and thus there will be increasing demand for labor in those countries, whereas many surrounding countries have surplus amounts of labour. Already we see Japan is very dependent on foreign labor in sectors like agriculture and construction, although not through formal immigration but rather through exploitative “trainee” programs. Part of the debate around immigration and acceptance of refugees, both in Japan and other countries, relates to how to integrate people from another culture into a society. This is my field, of cross-cultural communication and understanding. There is a lot of room for further application of the lessons of the cross-cultural field in areas outside of business (where they are most often being utilised today), to help countries address issues related to immigrants and refugees. Chris Leinberger, Nonresident Senior Fellow – Metropolitan Policy Program, Brookings Institute The real political and societal changes I’m seeing are taking place at the micro-local level: the biggest sociopolitical movement has been the organisation at the “place” level of the neighbourhood level, at least in this country. It’s under the radar screen – we are fundamentally inserting a new level of governance in society, and it’s taking the form of neighbourhood associations at the super local level, taking the form of improvement districts, special assessment districts, like in Midtown Manhattan. All of these places are becoming organised. Every neighbourhood in this country has a neighbourhood organisation – 30 years ago this didn’t exist. Today, virtually every neighbourhood is organised. Business improvement districts in particular are making leaps and bounds in the management of our society and they are recognising and working with technology firms to far better understand how these places work. The next big technological jump is a software jump: we now have the hardware. The issue is coming up with software that will create the mega database that will understand every part of the built environment at the place level, and eventually, the metropolitan level. Right now, nobody knows what’s in Midtown [Manhattan]. We don’t know what percentage of that is office; what percentage of that is retail. We didn’t have those data sets 15 years ago, and we didn’t have the software, and we certainly didn’t have the computing capability. So when a city or when a business improvement district makes a major capital investment in the future, you could foresee the time that we’ll be able to say, ‘okay, let’s build the Second Avenue subway. It’ll cost us $5bn and this is the expected economic and tax revenues we will get from that based on this data set, and we will then decide what to do – and we will look at secondary consequences like gentrification and see how we’re going to address that based upon those future projects we make.’ We will learn much better how to plan, build, and pay for these places; invest in the right thing. Right now conclusions are based on guestimations, like ridership. We’re getting closer to saying this is going to be the economic and fiscal benefit of doing that, and here are the unintended consequences we need to be concerned about: congestion, gentrification, displacement, whatever. All those tools will help place managements. This is a new field of place management. Edward Paice, Director, Africa Research Institute In Africa, very rapid urban growth – spatial and demographic – is occurring without adequate planning (or, in many locations, any planning at all). Even where master plans have been drawn up, these tend to be either ‘fantasy designs’ drawing on wholly inappropriate models such as Dubai or Singapore; or they mimic equally inappropriate plans drawn up for cities in Europe or the US. Urbanisation in Africa is occurring in its own distinctive fashion and there are significant variations within and between countries. But one common feature is that the economies of nearly all towns and cities are predominantly informal. The creation of long-term, decent jobs by the state and private enterprise is woefully inadequate; industrialisation remains for the most part absent. For African urbanisation to become a positive economic and social development, as opposed to a ticking time-bomb, urban planning needs to incorporate total populations, not simply the rich and middle classes; this is the only way that the economic potential of the majority can be harnessed for the national good. How can this be done? Firstly, citizens have to be involved. Community participation in slum redevelopment initiatives has proven to be a far more productive and cheaper way of going about things than imposing ill-conceived, expensive schemes from above. Secondly, the technology exists to facilitate the rapid planning required – for example, data collection with mobile phones and satellite imagery have already been beneficial. Thirdly, urban-dwellers everywhere – voters – can mobilise even more effectively to ensure that their elected representatives deliver more. We are seeing this occurring in more and more towns and cities and it is a very positive development for cities, for infrastructure development and for democracy. Even in autocracies there is always room for citizens to organise and thereby secure services or rights that they have been denied. The final, essential, component is political will. This has been conspicuously lacking, but more determined and competent mayors and city leaders are emerging and the power of example is considerable. The majority of Africans will live in towns and cities by 2050. Management consultancies and international financiers routinely claim that rapid urbanisation is one of the great pluses in the investment case for Africa. As things stand, this is hyperbolic nonsense. For towns and cities to drive economic growth and livelihood improvement, more imaginative and effective urban planning and management are imperative; and the provision of public goods must replace a narrow focus on the wellbeing of elites. Nick Reed, Academy Director at the Transport Research Laboratory Safety of travel – by that I mean not just the 1.3m that die on the roads each year (clearly unacceptable) but also the broader implications (effects on mental health and respiratory illness through poor air quality; need to move sustainable travel – walking and cycling to tackle obesity, diabetes etc) Automation – as we move towards automated, electric vehicles, need to consider the effect on employment and wider implications of how we access mobility. Travelling on busy roads at peak hours could become the preserve of those who can afford to pay – how does that affect commuting etc; how will this change urban planning etc. AI – automated vehicles are one application of AI but what are the wider implications for employment (need for universal basic income?), privacy and security Shin-pei Tsay, ‎Executive Director, Gehl Institute Within urban areas, a significant constraint today and into the future will be how people move around the city. Many extoll the potential of technology to overcome that problem. Whatever technology may accomplish, we will still need to think about how space is used: automated and ride-sharing vehicles take up as much room as regular cars, whether they're on the road or parked off the street. Going into the future, urban space still needs to be designed to maximize places for people to congregate, which are key to building social connections, fostering a sense of belonging, and encouraging community efficacy. Space for human connection is often not considered at all against technological solutions in cities. Without the design of places to support a social dimension, cities will not thrive regardless of how much technology we attempt to integrate, design for, and adopt. Public health outcomes increase when isolation diminishes and people connect. We save billions in environmental costs if we plan for places that encourage people to spend time outside. We even reduce economic limitations in labor markets when we plan for places that allow people to shorten their commute distances and have access to stores, schools, and other daily services. It's always fun to consider panaceas that can theoretically solve age-old problems (in this case, growing populations with increasing travel needs). However, not nearly enough attention is given to the social impacts of these new solutions. We must carefully consider how they may change the physical shape and design of our cities in the future. Most importantly, we must be aware of how they might isolate us. After all, by limiting our ability to socialize, technology may only generate new problems to replace the ones it ""solved."" Nicholas Agar, professor of ethics at the Victoria University of Wellington Recent advances in gene editing suggest a future in which we can radically upgrade human genomes. We might use tools including CRISPR to rewrite genes that influence traits such as intelligence and lifespan. We should bear in mind when we contemplate this enhanced future that the obvious answers aren’t always the right ones. The human genome isn’t something we should seek to build a wall around, protecting it from all change. But a rush to enhance ourselves may erase aspects of our humanity that proper reflection reveals as valuable. More IQ points aren’t better than fewer in the straightforward way that more money is better than less. We risk oversimplifying what’s involved in enhancement. Proper reflection on what about us we might want to preserve takes time – it should draw on a wide range of perspectives about what it means to be human. It’s difficult to set aside this time for ethical reflection when new technological possibilities seem to be coming thick and fast. Luke Alphey, visiting professor, Department of Zoology, University of Oxford Agricultural pest insects, and mosquitoes transmitting diseases, are long-standing problems for which we still have no satisfactory solution, indeed the problems are becoming more pressing. Modern genetics can potentially provide powerful new means for controlling these ancient enemies with greater effectiveness and precision – for example minimal off-target effects on the environment – than currently-used methods. Gene drives are just one aspect of this, but perhaps encapsulate some of the issues. One gene drive system, involving inserting into mosquito cells a large amount of foreign (to the mosquito) DNA in the form of an intracellular bacterium (Wolbachia), has entered field trials in several countries. This specific system has avoided the “genetic” or “GMO” label and regulatory system by adroit marketing and some technicalities and perhaps illustrates what could be done if the field were not caught up in the baggage and polarised politics of the GM crops “debate”. Potential applications of genetic methods in public health and conservation biology, for example, have very little in common with GM crops; lumping them together risks poor debate, poor policy and – in my view – potential delay or loss of huge human and environmental benefits. Elizabeth Bradley, Professor of Grand Strategy, Head of Branford College, Professor of Public Health and Faculty Director of the Yale Global Health Leadership Institute The tremendous impact that social, environmental and behavior factors have on our health overall. Recent research has shown that a country’s ratio of health to social service spending is predictive of some key health outcomes, like life expectancy, infant mortality, and maternal mortality. Genetics and health care play a role, but social, environmental, and behavioral factors have far greater impact on the whole health of a population. Some examples of social service investments include job training, supportive housing, and nutritional support – all of which have traditionally had an underestimated focus of attention. Health and social services should be better integrated toward the achievement of common metrics, like lower rates of smoking, obesity, and depression. More research is needed, to measure the health care cost savings of early childhood education or income support programs, and to identify the most sustainable integrated models. Meaningful change in our world’s health may come less from investing in medical care than in addressing the social determinants of health. Chelsea Clinton, Vice Chair, Clinton Foundation Read Clinton’s extended response about the US opioid epidemic. Jennifer Doudna, Professor of Molecular and Cell Biology and Chemistry at the University of California, Berkeley, co-inventor of CRISPR-Cas9 technology As ​a​ co-inventor of CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology, I am delighted to see that this groundbreaking ability to “cut and paste” genes so efficiently is being harnessed ​as ​a strategy to create new food, therapeutics, materials and ​methods for controlling the spread of diease​.​ A challenge moving forward is how to best engage the public with this fundamental science that really can positively impact human life and the world we live in. I believe that we must continue to discuss and consider the profound societal and ethical impact​s​ of CRISPR​ technology​ and ensure that ​it is not abused.c Joel Garreau, author, journalist, Professor of Law, Culture and Values, Sandra Day O’Connor College of Law, Arizona State University The major challenge consuming me is that the wheels are coming off the Enlightenment right now, on our watch, and it’s our own damn fault. The GRIN technologies – the genetics, robotics, information and nano revolutions – are advancing on a curve. Meanwhile, we humans are trying to process this exponential change with our good old v. 1.0 brains. With precious little help at all from those creating this upheaval. Folk are not stupid. They can clearly detect the ground moving beneath their feet, and that of their children and jobs and futures. When the ground moves beneath her feet, any sane primate looks for something apparently solid to hold onto. Anybody with apparently simple stories about what’s going on, forcefully told, *will* get attention. You’ve doubtless seen the data about how the most common job in the vast majority of states is truck driver. So what are we doing? We’re obsoleting these jobs as fast as we can, with a hand wave about how, “Oh, they’ll find better jobs.” While, meanwhile, the rate of suicide and drug addiction and protest voting among the solid middle-aged former middle-class soars. These guys are not stupid. They know they’ve been had. And we’re going to pay for it. And don’t tell me the solution is to have the robots just give them a guaranteed income. Humans require meaning as surely as food. The days when scientists could not [care] about the impact of their work on cultural, values and society are over. If they ever existed, which they didn’t, but that’s water over the dam. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve talked to guys working on, oh, something like massively increasing the number and power of mitochondria in human cells. And I’m like, you know that if you massively increase the amount of energy creation in cells, you’re talking about changing what it means to be human, right? Are you intentionally trying to create supermen? And the answer every time is “Wow, what a fascinating question, I never thought of that.” It’s not that these scientists are stupid, obviously. It’s that they’re tunnel-vision. They don’t wake up thinking about how they can change the human race. They wake up thinking about how they’re going to wire the goddamn monkey. That’s just the way these guys are. Fix it. Get out of your silo. If you can’t figure out the societal and cultural implications of what you’re doing, start seeking out people who might, and start systematically having lunch with them. And then invite the most interesting ones into your lab with the goal of them becoming partners. One example of this was the scientist who was spending her life finding the biomarkers for a disease for which there was no cure. Mercifully, her lab was among the first to start systematically bringing in partners from entirely outside. One of them asked, “What’s the point of creating despair? Might it be possible for you to find it interesting to search for a biomarker for a disease to which there is a cure?” To which she replied, of course, “Wow, what a fascinating question, I never thought of that.” But once it was pointed out to her, she happily did find another interesting biomarker problem that was culturally useful. Culture moves slower than does innovation. That’s just what humans are like. Deal with it, or watch the collapse of the Enlightenment as they ever increasingly come at you with torches and pitchforks – and correctly so. Mary Shelley knew her humans. My wife and I used to raise border collies. Border collies make terrible pets. You can not give an intelligent species nothing to do. If you don’t give them sheep, or something comparably interesting, they will come up with something to occupy their great minds. And you may not like it. Laurie Garrett, Pulitzer Prize-winning science journalist, senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations 1. Greatest frustration: It is deeply annoying and vexing that CRISPR-cas9 and other gene editing techniques are being applied to treatment of rare diseases and a host of pharmacology development, but little investment is directed toward application of state-of-the-art gene editing or metagenomic sequencing and detection for point-of-care diagnostics creation. There are many exciting developments at the lab bench level that could translate into ""Star Trek""-like abilities to wade into epidemic hysteria and swiftly identify who is infected, and with what organism. There are even innovations that allow identification on-the-spot of infections with previously unknown microbes, based on conserved genetic regions found in classes of viruses or bacteria. But nobody seems interested in bankrolling such game-changing innovations for production on a mass scale. It's a market failure issue – a where's-the-profits problem. If Ebola broke out somewhere tomorrow we are better off today in that some methods for quickly identifying the virus in blood samples exist, but even now they remain noncommercial, require a laboratory and have no relevance to real-world conditions. 2. In 2009-10 some in the national security community were obsessed with concern about gain-of-function research, mainly on flu viruses. Researchers were deliberately creating forms of H5N1 and H7N9 and H1N1 that could be passed mammal-2-mammal, probably human-to-human. The goal on researchers' parts was to understand what genetic switches had to occur to turn a bird flu into a potentially catastrophic human airborne transmissible pandemic strain. But of course the work was very dangerous – especially if it got into the wrong hands. That was then, this is now: The technology of gene modification is far more advanced, and application of cutting edge gene excision and incision techniques makes gain-of-function work potentially far easier, and more dangerous. The two governments that were taking the lead on dual-use research of concern issues (UK and US) are both preoccupied now with very different problems and new leadership. And the WHO was the lead global agency – it is facing a major leadership change. So we have no guidance regarding how governments are likely to view these issues. Tim Jinks, Head of Drug Resistant Infections at Wellcome Trust Modern medicine depends on doctors having effective drugs to treat infections. But many common infections are becoming more difficult to treat because bacteria are becoming resistant to the drugs available. Drug-resistant infection – or antimicrobial resistance – is a very serious health threat to us all. Already it results in around 700,000 deaths a year globally. Within a generation it could be 10 million; it could mean we can no longer safely carry out not only complex, lifesaving treatments such as chemotherapy and organ transplants but also more routine operations like caesareans and hip replacements. More needs to be done to improve our ability to diagnose, treat and prevent drug resistant infections and to speed up development of new antibiotics to replace those no longer effective in protecting us against deadly infections. Anit Mukherjee, policy fellow at the Center for Global Development Technological innovation is progressing rapidly not only in the digital sphere but also in areas such as health, education, nutrition, food safety and life-saving/enhancing drugs. However, the gains of these new technologies are being captured by a minority of the population both domestically and internationally. While the digital divide has received more attention (and being bridged significantly), inequality is manifesting in other sectors that ultimately affect peoples’ well being. One outcome is human migration which is not only political but also economic and social. The other is the more frequent outbreaks of diseases, epidemics and pandemics such as ebola, MARS and Zika. In a world where there is a sentiment against movement of goods and people, how can developing societies adapt to increasing inequalities and build systems of governance to ensure human security? Pardis Sabeti, Associate Professor of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology and of Immunology and Infectious Diseases, Harvard University The recent Ebola and Zika epidemics exposed our global vulnerabilities to deadly microbial threats and highlighted the need for proactive measures in advance of outbreaks and swift action during them. At the same time it shows our ability to prevent, diagnose, and treat deadly infectious diseases through new technologies. It is a time of great potential for devastation or advancement for one of the greatest challenges of our lifetimes. Robert Sparrow, adjunct professor, Centre for Human Bioethics, Monash University What does justice require of wealthy Northern states when confronted by mass migration from increasingly impoverished Southern countries as a result of accelerating climate change? How should we respond, both ethically and emotionally, to the knowledge that we are living through one of history’s fastest periods of extinction and that this catastrophe is the result of humankind’s activities? As technological developments increasingly drive social change, how can democratic societies empower ordinary people to have a say in the decisions that shape the technological trajectories that will in turn determine what the future looks like? How can the public have meaningful input into the character of the algorithms that will increasingly determine both the nature of their relationships with other people on social media and their access to various important social goods? How can we prevent an underwater arms race involving autonomous submersibles over the coming decades? Should we use “gene drives” to try to eliminate disease vectors in nature? How can we ensure that questions about meaning and values, and not just calculations of risks and benefits, are addressed in decisions about human genome editing? Eric Topol, Scripps Transatlantic Science Institute Our major challenge is related to our new capability of digitizing human beings. That is, via biosensors, DNA sequencing and imaging, we can define each individual’s medical essence. But the problem is that this generates many terabytes of data, which includes real-time streaming of key metrics like blood pressure. Aggregating and processing the data, derived from many sources, with algorithms and artificial intelligence (particularly deep learning) is a daunting task. Once we can do this, we’ll be on our way to a virtual medical coach – your smartphone providing instantaneous feedback on all your health and medical metrics to help prevent you from getting sick. Mike Turner, Head of Infection and Immunobiology at Wellcome Trust Infectious disease outbreaks are a growing threat to health and prosperity in our modern world. Vast amounts of international travel, increasing urbanisation and a changing climates means that viruses can cross borders and spread around the globe faster than ever before. Recent outbreaks like Sars, Ebola and Zika have all shown how unprepared the world is to deal with epidemics. To stand any chance of tackling this threat, we need new vaccines, stronger healthcare systems and a better coordinated global response. At Wellcome, we’re working to address this threat in a variety of ways; we are a founding partner of the Coalition for Epidemics Preparedness Innovations (Cepi) that will develop new vaccine candidates against infections we know could cause a serious epidemic. The WHO also needs to be much better funded and have the mandate to respond swiftly and effectively when diseases do begin to spread. Only by investing, coordinating and working together can we expect to prepare the world for the next inevitable epidemic. Watch our animation with words by Bill Gates on Cepi’s vaccine plans. Gavin Yamey, professor of the practice of global health, Duke University Global Health Institute I believe one of the most urgent global issues that we face in 2017 and beyond, and one that we are woefully ill-prepared for, is the threat of epidemics and pandemics. We have three enormous gaps in the global system of preparedness. First, many countries have weak national systems for detecting and responding to outbreaks. Second, we have too few vaccines, medicines, and diagnostics for emerging infectious diseases with outbreak potential. Third, at the international level, we simply don’t yet have a robust, joined-up approach to providing the essential components of a preparedness and response system – like surge capacity in producing vaccines in a crisis, an inter-connected global surveillance system, or a global reserve corps of emergency responders. Closing these three gaps is one of the most urgent global priorities if we are to avert a potential world catastrophe. For example, if we suffer another flu pandemic similar to the 1918 “Spanish flu,” the World Bank estimates that there could be 71 million deaths and a global recession costing over $3 trillion. Homi Kharas, senior fellow and deputy director of Brookings Institute’s Global Program The battle for sustainable development will be won or lost in cities. 150 million people are moving to cities each year. By 2050, over 7 billion people will live in cities (80% of the world), and cities will be responsible for 75% of global carbon emissions. Cities are places where infrastructure gets locked in for decades, if not centuries, but city planners must make investments now in a world where technology is changing rapidly where people live, work and play, and how they access buildings, transport, energy and waste management. The fastest growth is happening in thousands of secondary cities where mayors and city managers are not well schooled in technical urban planning. Often, these secondary cities must collaborate with each other to deliver services effectively across boundaries within larger metropolitan areas. Carey King, assistant director, University of Texas at Austin Energy Institute We need a discussion as to what political leaders, business leaders, and citizens think is an appropriate distribution of wealth across the entire population. This focuses on the real question (how many people have what, independent of the size of the economy, though the two are linked) instead of discussing how to shape policies and taxes to achieve an unspecified growth target independent of wealth distribution. Trump, Brexit, and Le Pen are representations that people understand growth only for the elite in the West is no longer tenable. An issue that has not received enough attention in the media and popular understanding is that the Earth is finite and this fact will have real world physical, economic, social, and political implications. Neoclassical economics ignores this obvious fact, yet it is used to guide most policy (eg, economic projections and scenarios), including that for climate change mitigation. Thus, we are using an economic theory that is simply incapable and inapplicable for informing an unprecedented transformation of the economy. Vijay Padmanabhan, Asian Development Bank, Technical Advisor (Urban) The one major challenge we will face due to urbanisation will be 'water security'. We are already grappling with this problem across our developing member countries and with deteriorating river or surface water quality, lack of sufficient ground water sources and increasing dependence on sea water as a supply source, we have to bring in innovations in water management. Treatment technology, water aquifer mapping, recycling and reuse of wastewater, etc. are areas of R&D investment. ADB is working with a large number of utilities to address these issues and as we engage on a long term basis with many cities and utilities, we will be actively exploring opportunities to bring in value for money propositions so that the utility benefits in the long term. We are also connecting with industry leaders to understand market trends so that we can bring the best to our developing member countries. William Ryerson, founder and president, the Population Institute and Population Media Center Perhaps a summary is that the human enterprise has outgrown the long-ability of the planet’s renewable resources to support us at our current numbers and our current rates of consumption and waste generation. Climate change is just one piece of evidence of this fact. Technological improvements, while potentially important in reducing per capita impact, are not sufficient to make us sustainable unless we also stop growth in human numbers and reduce average consumption, while simultaneously lessening the gap between the richest and the poorest people on the planet. Sustainability is a term that is not well understood and is misused, but the reality is that any activity that is not sustainable will stop. So far, non-renewable resources are what are primarily driving our economic engine. But by definition, non-renewables are being depleted and for the most part will stop being economically available in this century. So we must plan rapidly for the day when humanity can live using just renewable resources, while maintaining the biodiversity that makes the planet habitable. In truth, sustainability is the ultimate environmental issue, the ultimate health issue, and the ultimate human rights issue. Strategies that help to bring about changes in societal behaviour, including reproductive behavior, are critically important in achieving sustainability. Use of entertainment media is a key component of such strategies, since a large share of humanity consume entertainment mass media during free time. For that reason, Population Media Center utilises long-running serialised dramas in various countries to create characters that gradually evolve into positive role models for the audience to bring about changes in social norms on a broad array of critical issues. Attached are three documents that describe this work and its effects. Jim Watson, Director of the UK Energy Research Centre We need to think about how the system will fit together as our energy systems change. Globally speaking there is still a lot of people – 1.5 billion or so – who do not have access to modern energy services. There is going to be a lot of rising demand from regions like Africa. One of the big challenges of deploying new energy technologies, particularly these intermittent renewables like wind and solar, is the impact they have on the system. It used to be that in the summer it was a really quiet time for the grid operator compared to the winter, but now they are having this peak in generation in summer due to solar energy when demand is low. They are having to juggle this as we cannot store electricity in large quantities yet. This is a new way of operating for them. With the sort of changes we are seeing in energy systems around the world, cheaper and better storage is going to be a big part of the solution. When it comes to heating for somewhere like the UK, you might need storage that lasts several months. You get a lot of energy generated in the summer and you might need it in the winter to heat homes. This is an area that is really ripe for innovation and we are really only at the start of deploying and trailing those. It is a critical part of this new system we are trying to create. Peter Barron, VP Communications, EMEA, Google Google was built on providing people with high-quality and authoritative results for their search queries. We strive to give users a breadth of diverse content from variety of sources and we’re committed to the principle of a free and open web. Judging which pages on the web best answer a query is a challenging problem and we don’t always get it right. When non-authoritative information ranks too high in our search results, we develop scalable, automated approaches to fix the problems, rather than manually removing these one-by-one. We recently made improvements to our algorithm that will help surface more high quality, credible content on the web. We’ll continue to change our algorithms over time in order to tackle these challenges. Rohit Chandra, VP Engineering, Yahoo Search providers face a confluence of human and technology challenges. While we provide the portal for users to find information, we depend on content creators and distributors to apply journalistic discipline to what they are creating. The scale of popular social networks has democratized publishing, which effectively lets anyone – regardless of their intentions or qualifications – produce content that can appear journalistic. Another challenge is that technology-driven online engines like ours learn through click-feedback or “crowd-sourcing.” That runs the risk of perpetuating a “herd-mentality” – in which if lots of users start chasing a particular news source (maybe based on shock value rather than credibility), our AI-systems could accidentally “learn” and treat that source as highly valued or credible. I do see a need in the market to develop standards, perhaps from an organization like Nielsen. Facebook and others are working on this, too. The answer has to be a combination of technology and editorial; we can’t fact-check every story, but there must be enough human eyes on the content that we know the quality bar stays high. Eddie Copeland, director of government Innovation at Nesta, a UK charity that has looked at the future of democracy in the digital world Rather than waiting for politicians to make decisions and then we all argue over whether what they say reflects reality, we could have tools that engage people much earlier in the process so they can be involved in formulating ideas and drafting legislation, following the course of how ideas go from concept to becoming laws and how effective they are in reality. It might just give you a fighting chance of making people feel part of a system rather than observing it from the outside. Nonny de la Pena, virtual reality journalist and CEO of Emblematic Group Call me idealistic, but I really believe if you have an informed global citizenry, then people are going to make better decisions. We are going through the pain of, how do we convey information that’s accurate? People may not be looking at traditional media for their solutions. I think for audiences, VR is a totally different type of story. There is nothing in print or radio or broadcast that can let you walk around in actual space. That kind of effort, of making those kinds of pieces, is going to get easier and easier. You’ll be walking around the scene, not looking at flat screen or video. When you walk around, it’s a whole other level. Now your body can engage. Now when I go to the movies, I find the frames so artificial – I can see the box. I see the square. When I put on a headset, I see the world. The fact that audiences are going to be engaged with this kind of storytelling make sit a very important opportunity for journalism to embrace. Ben Fletcher, senior software engineer at IBM Watson Research who worked on a project to build an AI fact checker We got a lot of feedback that people did not want to be told what was true or not. At the heart of what they want, was actually the ability to see all sides and make the decision for themselves. A major issue most people face, without knowing it, is the bubble they live in. If they were shown views outside that bubble they would be much more open to talking about them. Kevin Kelly, founding executive editor of Wired Magazine The major new challenge in reporting news is the new shape of truth. Truth is no longer dictated by authorities, but is networked by peers. For every fact there is a counterfact. All those counterfacts and facts look identical online, which is confusing to most people. The only way a fact becomes accepted as true is to be networked with other facts consider to be true. Like in Science, all truth is provisional, although some is more provisional than others. The Truth is really a network of truths, and each of these true facts is probabilistic. The probability of a fact being true is increased by the degree it is networked with other true facts and the reliability of truthfulness by its source. So the challenge before us is to begin to construct a truth signaling layer into the fabric of facts, particularly online. This will be a multi-generational effort that will resemble the construction of wikipedia, but goes far beyond it. Stephan Lewandowsky, a psychologist at University of Bristol who studies persistence of misinformation in society Having a large number of people in a society who are mis-informed and have their own set of facts is absolutely devastating and extremely difficult to cope with. There are solutions available – using the technology that has given rise to this problem. Turning it upside down by changing the algorithms in Facebook or on Google to nudge people into sharing or consuming news that are slightly outside their normal comfort zone. What is happening now is that the cookies you gather as you browse the web will tell the website what it is you like. The way to get out of this polarisation is for these algorithms to suggest something that I might not like or agree with but is not so offensive to me that I wouldn’t look at it. That way you can keep people from self-radicalising in these ecological bubbles. That sort of technological solution is one good way forward. I think we have to work on that. Alexios Mantzarlis, chair of the International Fact Checking Network I see a challenge in the flood of reasonable-looking information out there making it harder to distinguish between sources of information. Search algorithms are as flawed as the people who develop them. We should think about adding layers of credibility to sources. We need to tag and structure quality content in effective ways. Will Moy, director of Full Fact, an independent fact checking organisation based in the UK Even if we have structures that impose constraints on people in power and we put pressure on powerful people to be honest with us, in a sense, all of that is being circumvented by social media. On Facebook, political bodies can put something out, pay for advertising, put it in front of millions of people, yet it is hard for those not being targeting to know they have done that. They can target those people based on how old they are, where they live, what skin colour they have, what gender they are. These messages are so common and so targeted, they are capable of having a massive influence on public decisions. We have never had a time when it has been so easy to advertise to millions of people and not have the other millions of us notice. You can’t take out an advert in a newspaper and not have the people you are not targeting not notice. that is a really profound change. We shouldn’t think of social media as just peer to peer communication – it is also the most powerful advertising platform there has ever been. We need a more equipped environment - we need watchdogs that will go around and say hang on, this doesn’t stack up and ask them to correct the record. There is a role for watchdogs and there is also a role for all of us. Paul Resnick, professor of information at the University of Michigan who developed a tool for identifying rumours on social media called RumourLens The fundamental challenge we now face is how to handle a setting where anybody can get their views disseminated without intermediaries to prevent the distribution. Somehow there still has to be some process of collectively coming to some agreement of what we are going to believe and what we think are consensual facts. A lot of what I have seen in terms of approaches to deal with that are trying to do things that are focused on assessing the content of factual claims to try to verify whether they are true or not. I don’t think that at its heart will be the mechanism. I think that it is going to be not figuring what to believe but who to believe. Most individuals can’t personally verify most factual claims that we hear. If you think about some of the things you personally believe that are fact, there are many that you have not personally verified. It would be tremendously inefficient for all of us to try to personally verify all of these things. We have to have a setting where we trust other people. Victoria Rubin, director of the language and information technology research lab at Western University, Ontario, Canada If there are people who are willing to blatantly refuse to believe that something is a lie, no matter how hard you try, they won't listen. I'm not sure what amount of evidence is needed in this new paradigm of journalism to get newsreaders out of their new bubbles. Human psychology is the main obstacle, unwillingness to bend one's mind around facts that don't agree with one's own viewpoint. We're studying how news framing affects attribution of blame for events described in the news, and whether there is mitigating effect of partisan beliefs. The second newer misleading type of fakes that's gaining traction is native ads (specifically, in news), or sponsored content that's disguised as editorials, or what's formerly known as advertorials. Such misleading practice constitutes an internal threat to the profession of journalism and may further deteriorate mainstream media trust. If information users are unaware of the Native Ads original promotional nature, they may find themselves insufficiently informed or misled by its content.
