Bond Market Volatility,What is the US Federal Reserve doing?,2024-09-14,2017-09-20,By Andrew Walker,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-41320675,"The US Federal Reserve has decided to start running down the stock of financial assets it bought in its quantitative easing scheme. Quantitative easing was a policy that the Fed, and other central banks, used to prevent the recession that followed the financial crisis from becoming an even deeper downturn.  It involved buying financial assets with money newly created by the central bank. In the US the assets were bonds or debts issued by the Federal government and by official agencies that support lending to home buyers. One aim of the policy was to reduce the interest rates paid by businesses and households borrowing money.  Normally central banks try to do that by using their own interest rate policies, which in the case of the Fed means a target it sets for overnight borrowing between commercial banks, known as the Federal Funds Rate. But when that official rate got to almost zero, as it did in December 2008, the Fed's policy makers thought that it couldn't, or shouldn't go any lower.  The Fed's own research suggests that its QE policy has helped reduce long term interest rates. The consequence of all that QE is that the Fed now holds about four and a half trillion dollars of assets. Before it started the programme the figure was less than a quarter of that amount.  Assessments of the impact of QE vary, but many economists take the view that it has helped the US economy.  Many also fear it has created a new danger of financial market instability.  Share and bond prices are high. Some argue that there is a bubble that could burst and trigger a new financial crisis.  The Fed's asset purchases mean there has been more demand for the assets it is buying which tends to push the prices up. In addition, the sellers of those assets need to do something with the money they receive. They may repay debt, but in many cases they buy other assets, often assets with more risk of losing money - such as shares or assets in emerging economies. That in turn tends to push their prices up.  That is what lies behind the concerns about possible financial instability.  All the major developed world central banks, apart from Canada's, have used quantitative easing and several are still actively buying financial assets. In the US however, the Fed stopped in 2014.  But that doesn't mean that it stopped buying assets at the time.   Bonds are debts which (mostly) have a repayment or maturity date when the holder receives the face value of the bond from the borrower or issuer of the bond.  The debt is in effect repaid to whoever owns the bond on the date it matures. In the case of US government bond, it's the Treasury that would repay the central bank.  So far, the Fed has used the proceeds of these repayments to buy more bonds in the financial markets keeping its holdings roughly constant.  Now it is going to reduce the amount that it 'reinvests' in that way. So over time, as more bonds mature its holdings of them will decline.  It also means that over time the extra money it created in the first place to buy the bonds will decline.  As an aside it's worth emphasising that the newly created money is not something that can be spent on goods and services. It is money called reserves, which is held in accounts owned by commercial banks at the central bank.  It's used for transactions between banks and is an important part of the financial and monetary system. But other types of business and households can't use this type of money. Having said that, adding to the total amount of reserves can lead to an increase in money held by the public but it is an indirect effect.  Running down the Fed's holdings of assets will also mean that the amount of reserves held by the banks will decline too.  As with interest rate increases the Fed's approach is cautious. There is no hurry to get things back to what might be considered normal. The decline in its bond holdings in the first month will be no more than ten billion dollars, rising gradually over the course of the following year.  We haven't been told what the ultimate level will be. But the Fed has said that the amount of reserves held by the banks when this process is complete is likely to be higher than before the crisis. All the time there is a degree of wariness among central bankers in the US and other developed economies that they could set back the recovery if they were to raise interest rates or change their QE policies too quickly.  There was a warning in 2013 with an episode that came to be known as the ""taper tantrum"". That was a time when the Fed's QE bond purchases were in full swing. The then Chair of the Fed, Ben Bernanke suggested that it might start to slow down the purchases - or taper its QE. That led to significant volatility in financial markets.  It most likely didn't too much lasting economic damage, but it has probably reinforced the cautious instincts of the current Fed Chair Janet Yellen. She certainly doesn't want to see another tantrum. She has said she wants the Fed's unwinding of its QE to be like ""watching paint dry"". "
Bond Market Volatility,Shares of India's 'family silverware' go on sale,2024-09-14,2022-05-04,By Nikhil Inamdar,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-61296184,"Shares in the Indian state-run insurance giant Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) went on sale this week in a $2.75bn (£2.18bn) initial public offering, witnessing strong demand from investors. The government is offering a 3.5% stake in what will be India's largest share sale, despite both the size and valuation of the issue being slashed significantly to reflect current market conditions. The issue was fully subscribed on Thursday, a day after it opened for sale to retail investors, employees and policy holders. The date for share listing is 17 May, the government's Department of Investment and Public Asset Management said. Bids for anchor investors opened on 2 May but share sale for the public opened on 4 May and would close on 9 May. General investors can buy equity shares at a price band set at $11.75-12.36 (£9.38-9.87) per share. The company's policyholders, employees as well as small mom and pop investors will be entitled to an additional discount of up to 60 rupees, according to papers filed by the company with India's securities watchdog.Broking firm Zerodha expects at least 8-12 million additional online trading accounts to be opened by investors keen to apply for the IPO, a 10-15% bump up from the 80 million accounts currently in operation. LIC is nearly as old as independent India. Formed by nationalising and merging 245 private insurance companies, it started issuing policies in 1956, holding a monopoly on India's insurance sector until the turn of the millennium.   More than two decades after private competition was allowed, LIC continues to hold a leadership position, with 66% market share as of 2021.   Its sheer size makes the insurance behemoth a systemically important company for India.    At over $500bn, its asset base is bigger than the GDP of several countries. And with nearly 280 million policies in force, it manages four times more policies than the entire population of the UK.   It is also India's largest asset manager, with massive investments in state and central securities as well as the stock market.   According to the ratings agency CRISIL, LIC's equity investments in listed companies represented 4% of the total market capitalisation of the National Stock Exchange. It has also been the default financier of the government in trying times, bailing out flailing state-run companies.   LIC also owns a sprawling portfolio of real estate across India.   With 1.3 million distributors selling policies across pretty much every nook and corner in India, the ubiquitous ""LIC agent"" has held a unique place in independent India's public consciousness.   Srinivasalu Naidu, a septuagenarian who has sold policies door to door for the past 30 years, told the BBC he was known in his heyday as ""LIC Naidu"", a much revered figure in his village in the southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh.    Agents like him have been critical to the company's growth and mission to build trust and create a savings culture across the remote corners of the country.   ""People didn't buy policies from me just as insurance, they did it as an investment. For their kids' education or wedding. They trusted their life savings with me,"" said Naidu.   Private banking giant UBS estimates 10 out of every 100 rupees saved by Indian households go into LIC, a much larger amount than even the deposits attracted by India's largest bank, the State Bank of India.   Given LIC's social relevance and scaled-down valuation, India's opposition politicians have accused the government of selling ""family silverware"" and prioritising shareholders over politicians.  According to analysts, even at the upper price band, LIC's issue has been valued far lower by the government than its three listed private peers - HDFC Life Insurance Co., SBI Life Insurance Co. and ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Co.   ""It is not justified at all. You should also involve the opposition (in deliberations), when you are disinvesting something like the LIC which is a social security net,"" Dr Shama Mohamed, a spokesperson of the Congress party, told the BBC.   Last month, PM Narendra Modi's government decided to defer the mega IPO amid global stock market volatility due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. It had initially planned to raise about $8b by selling 5% of LIC to fund its widening fiscal deficit - the gap between earnings and expenditure.   Amid surging fuel costs and lower growth projections, the pruned fundraising target is expected to put additional pressure on New Delhi's already stretched finances.  But analysts say the size and price are appropriate given the current environment, with foreign investors pulling out nearly $20bn from Indian equities since October 2021. And the government is confident that LIC's dominant leadership position and fair valuation will attract significant investor interest.    ""Even if we have a bit of a constrained environment, we can still pull it off because that's the kind of optimum demand scenario which exists,"" Tuhin Kanta Pandey, secretary at the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management, told journalists in Mumbai last week.   In the long run, a stock market listing is expected to improve how the firm is run and bring in more transparency.  But at a time when its competitors have all gone digital, LIC's overt dependence on physical distributors has been flagged as a cause of concern by analysts, who believe it will continue losing market share in the years ahead.   ""On the margin front, it will be kind of hard for LIC to compete if it sticks to the distributor model. They will have to re-innovate the company and become relevant for what the insurance market will be tomorrow,"" says Nikhil Kamath, co-founder of Zerodha.   According to economic commentator Vivek Kaul, LIC pays agents twice as much in commissions in the first year, compared to private insurers, which is not sustainable in the longer run.   Covid-19 has also had an impact on the company. Its growth in new business premiums declined significantly as lockdowns disrupted operations, reiterating the need for LIC to significantly leverage technology to drive operating efficiency.   But analysts expect India's young population and massive under-penetration of life insurance to give LIC a long runway for expansion.   According to analysis from the broking firm Anand Rathi, India's protection gap - or the difference between the insurance required and actually available - was 83% or US$16.5 trillion in 2019, the highest in Asia-Pacific, ""thereby presenting a huge potential for growth""."
Bond Market Volatility,Goldman Sachs results beat expectations,2024-09-14,2017-10-17,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-41648796,"US banking giant Goldman Sachs has reported a fall in third-quarter profits following a further fall in bond trading revenue. However, the 26% drop in bond trading revenue was smaller than expected, following a slump of 40% in the second quarter.    Goldman's net income for the quarter fell by 3% from a year earlier to $2.04bn (£1.55bn).   Rival Morgan Stanley posted a stronger-than-expected rise in profits. Net income rose 11% to $1.69bn in the third quarter, helped by record revenues in its wealth management division which offset the decline in trading activity.  ""Our third quarter results reflected the stability our wealth management, investment banking and investment management businesses bring when our sales and trading business faces a subdued environment,"" said Morgan Stanley chief executive James Gorman. Goldman's bond-trading division has seen three consecutive quarters of declines as a result of low volatility in the market for trading fixed income, commodities and currencies.  However, Oppenheimer analyst Chris Kotowski said: ""After two quarters in a row severely missing Wall Street's bond trading estimates, Goldman's 26% decline did not look so bad. ""While we did not see a sharp rebound in (bond) trading, one can, at a minimum, say that this quarter Goldman looked pretty much like everyone else.""   Goldman's bond trading results were of particular interest because it is more dependent on trading than rivals and it does not have a significant retail operation to offset recent declines. The bank's better-than-expected overall results were also fuelled by its performance in private equity investments and from higher fees that it earned through dealmaking."
Bond Market Volatility,Botticelli painting fetches record $92m at auction,2024-09-14,2021-01-28,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-55839330,"A portrait by Sandro Botticelli has sold for $92m (£67m) at auction, breaking a new record for the Italian renaissance painter. Young Man Holding a Roundel is believed to have been painted in the 1470s or 1480s and is considered one of Botticelli's finest portraits. It sold on Thursday at a Sotheby's auction in New York. The sale marks the first major indicator of the state of the art market this year. Prior to its sale, questions hung over the willingness of global art collectors to pay nine-figure sums for trophy works amid the coronavirus pandemic and market volatility. The successful sale of the Botticelli piece could help boost prices for other such paintings at a time when many art collectors are chasing newer works from post-war and contemporary artists. Sotheby's senior vice president Christopher Apostle described Young Man Holding a Roundel as a ""masterpiece"" ahead of the auction. ""This Botticelli is so much more spectacular in every way than anything we've seen coming to the market,"" he told the AFP news agency. ""This image symbolises and exemplifies the Renaissance in Florence. We haven't seen anything like it in my lifetime,"" he added. The painting shows a man in his late teenage years with long golden hair sitting holding a disc - the roundel - which features a bearded saint with his right hand raised. The roundel is an original 14th Century artwork attributed to Sienese painter Bartolommeo Bulgarini. Sotheby's displayed the painting around the world to collectors and potential bidders in advance of the auction in an effort to increase demand. ""The young man in the painting has done more travel during Covid than probably anybody we know,"" joked Charles Stewart, CEO of Sotheby's. It was displayed in Los Angeles, London and Dubai and accompanied by a catalogue with scholarly essays and technical analysis. The painting sold for $80m (£58.2), but the final price will be $92.2m (£67.1m) when fees and commissions are added. The auction was live streamed from New York and lasted less than five minutes with only two competitors for the painting, according to The New York Times. The selling price establishes the work as one of the most significant portraits to have ever sold at auction. The previous record for a Botticelli was set in 2013 when Madonna and Child with Young Saint John the Baptist sold for $10.4m (£7.6m). Other paintings which have sold for prices in this range include Gustav Klimt's Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer II, which sold for $87.9m (£64m) in 2006 and Vincent Van Gogh's Portrait of Dr Gachet, which fetched $82.5m (£60m) 1990. It is understood Young Man Holding a Roundel has been handed down through several generations of an aristocratic family in Wales for about 200 years. Art scholars were unaware of the painting's existence until it first appeared on the market in the early 20th Century. It has spent much of the last 40 years on public display since its current owner acquired it in 1982 for just £810,000. The painting has appeared at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art, the National Gallery in London and elsewhere. Botticelli, who lived from the 1440s to 1510, is one of the most celebrated painters of the early Renaissance period, but only about a dozen examples of his work survive today. Botticelli was forgotten for centuries after his death, but his work was rediscovered in the 19th Century, and the artist has since become one of the biggest names in art history. His best-known works are The Birth of Venus and Primavera. In 2016, an exhibition at London's V&A Museum, Botticelli Reimagined, explored the artist's enduring impact, particularly on today's pop culture.  The exhibition included a 2009 recreation of The Birth of Venus by photographer David LaChapelle, as well as interpretations of the same painting by Andy Warhol. The front cover of Lady Gaga's 2013 album Artpop also incorporated elements of the The Birth of Venus, and the painting inspired one of the lead singles from the album, Venus.

Bond Market Volatility,China pumps billions into economy as coronavirus hits,2024-09-14,2020-02-02,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51347497,"China is to pump a net 150 billion yuan ($22bn; £16.3bn) into its economy on Monday to help protect it from the impact of the coronavirus outbreak.  China's central bank said the move would ensure there was enough liquidity in the banking system and help provide a stable currency market. The virus has so far infected more than 14,000 people and claimed 305 lives - all but one inside China. The money will be deployed when China's markets reopen on Monday.  It comes after a holiday to mark the Lunar New Year was extended in the hope of reducing the spread of the virus. Financial regulators in the country have said they believe the impact on China's already slowing economy will be ""short term"".  But analysts say the impact of the virus - which has left major cities in full or partial lockdown - could harm growth if it lasts for a prolonged period. China's travel and tourism sectors have already taken a hit over an unusually quiet Spring Festival break, while cinemas were forced to close to try to contain the virus.  Meanwhile, numerous factories have suspended production while companies have instructed employees to work from home  Foxconn, Toyota, Starbucks, McDonald's and Volkswagen are just a few of the corporate giants to have paused operations or shuttered outlets across China. The country saw economic growth of 6.1% last year - the slowest in around three decades, in part because of its prolonged trade war with the US. A partial trade deal easing tensions was struck earlier this month, but most tariffs remain in place. Economist George Magnus, associate at Oxford University's China Centre, told the BBC the size of central bank's injection reflected ""policymakers' concerns about the state of the economy"". ""The coronavirus repercussions on the economy mark the latest in a series of setbacks in the economy over the past year, including a handful of bank failures sparking contagion fears, forcing the central bank to become ever more generous with the provision of liquidity to markets."" In total, the central bank will inject 1.2 trillion yuan into the financial system on Monday - the largest single day addition on record.  The net figure will be considerably lower, however, although the bank said it could make more cash available throughout the week.  China's central bank has announced other economic measures in the face of a deepening coronavirus epidemic, including providing banks with 300 billion yuan to lend to affected companies. Authorities have also relaxed tariffs on goods imported for use in the virus fight - including those from the US. Investors are bracing for volatility when Chinese markets reopen on Monday. The country's stock, currency and bond markets have all been closed since 23 January and were due to reopen last Friday.  Global markets have been rattled by the epidemic, with the US S&P 500 notching up its worst week since October on Friday. "
Bond Market Volatility,Apple iPhone sales fears rock Wall Street,2024-09-14,2018-11-12,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46186131,"Apple shares sank by 5% on Monday, dragging down US markets and wiping more than $40bn (£31bn; €35bn) off the tech giant's market value. The fall followed a profit warning from some of the firm's suppliers, which exacerbated concerns that demand for iPhones is slowing. The declines made the company one of the biggest losers on the Dow, which closed down 2.3%. The wider S&P 500 ended about 2% lower, while the Nasdaq fell more than 2.75%. Technology stocks led the Wall Street sell-off which saw shares in most sectors tumble.  Tech firms helped drive many of the stock market gains earlier in the year but now face rising calls for regulatory and tax changes that could hurt their growth. Amazon shares lost more than 4%, Alphabet dropped over 2.5% while Facebook fell 2.3%. Apple's share price fall came after Lumentum, a US manufacturer of facial recognition technology and Apple supplier, said one of its major customers had reduced its shipments. As a result, Lumentum downgraded its sales and profit outlook, sending its shares down over 30%. Lumentum's warning came shortly after another Apple supplier, Japan Display, also cut its full-year guidance blaming ""volatile customer demand"". The warnings from Apple suppliers extended a slide in Apple shares that started earlier this month after the firm's sales forecast disappointed investors. The shares closed at about $194, down 5% for the day and more than 15% below their peak in October. Apple has insisted that it is optimistic about its Christmas season outlook, attributing the weaker than expected forecast to one-off changes, such as the timing of the release of new phones, and temporary supply chain issues. It continues to make record profits, thanks to higher prices and growing income from its services business, which includes services such as the App Store, Apple Pay, Apple Music. But analysts have remained sceptical, especially after the firm said it would stop sharing the number of iPhones, iPads and Macs it sells with investors. They have warned that Apple's reliance on higher prices could also make it especially vulnerable if there is a broader pullback in consumer spending. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs, which has been embroiled in a corruption scandal at Malaysia's state-backed development fund, also dragged Wall Street indexes lower.  Shares in the investment bank ended down about 7.5%, after a Malaysian official said the country wanted a refund of the fees Goldman earned for work on bond sales for the 1MDB fund. A former Goldman executive this month pleaded guilty to US charges that he had participated in a scheme to use some of the money raised in those offerings for bribes. The US market declines come amid an extended period of volatility on Wall Street, with investors wary due to warnings of a slowdown in global growth, trade tensions, falling oil prices and rising interest rates. US companies are also facing a rising dollar, which hurts sales overseas.  The combination of factors has helped fuel speculation that corporate profits may be at their peak, especially after several companies, including Apple and Amazon, issued weaker than expected sales forecasts for the months ahead."
Bond Market Volatility,Recession fears prompt selling in global stocks,2024-09-14,2019-08-14,By Russell Hotten,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-49352760,"Global stock markets fell around the world as concerns about the US-China trade war and the global economy prompted investors to dump shares. The three main US stock markets closed 3% lower overnight, European stocks fell across the board, while Asian stock markets opened lower. Weak data from Germany and China on Wednesday helped fuel a rush for safe assets like bonds and gold. Bond market moves pointed to possible recessions in major economies. The US central bank also came under renewed pressure from US President Donald Trump for not doing enough to support the world's largest economy.  There are concerns that renewed attacks by Mr Trump on the Federal Reserve could erode investor confidence on its ability to make independent decisions. Analyst Oliver Pursche, from financial services company Bruderman, said the global picture was precarious. ""What's happening in Hong Kong, what's happening with Brexit and the trade war, it's all a mess,"" the chief market strategist said. ""Every central bank around the world is trying to prop up economies and every politician around the world is trying to destroy economies."" News that Germany's GDP contracted in the second quarter, and that China's industrial growth in July hit a 17-year low, had already spooked markets in Europe. The FTSE 100 closed more than 1% lower, while in Germany and France the markets finished more than 2% lower. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 dropped some 2% in early trading on Thursday, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng index opened 1.4% lower. Both later regained some ground. Disruptions related to pro-democracy protests have also weighed on the stock market in Hong Kong.  Another worry was that bond markets are flashing recession warnings.  The yield on two-year and 10-year Treasury bonds inverted for the first time since June 2007.  This means investor appetite for safety is such that they are willing to get lower returns for holding bonds for a longer period. Usually investors demand higher returns for holding bonds for longer due to the risks involved with parking your money away for a long time. Historically, such bond movements have been a reliable indicator of possible recessions, and preceded the last global downturn more than 10 years ago. The UK bond yield curve also inverted for the first time since 2008, while the yield gap between 10-year and 2-year German government bonds was at its tightest since the financial crisis. Meanwhile, the CBOE volatility index - the so-called fear index - jumped higher, and spot gold prices rose. On Wednesday, Mr Trump again attempted to deflect the market turmoil onto the US Federal Reserve and its interest rate policy, calling Fed chief Jerome Powell ""clueless"". In raising interest rates four times last year ""the Federal Reserve acted far too quickly, and now is very, very late"" in cutting borrowing costs, the president tweeted. ""Too bad, so much to gain on the upside!"" Recent presidents have avoided commenting on Fed policy, in a sign of respect for the bank's independence. Michelle Fleury, New York business correspondent The recession signal from the bond market will only heap pressure on the Federal Reserve to give the president what he wants - more rate cuts. Wall Street certainly thinks it's inevitable, pricing in a cut in September. Last month, America's central bank reduced its benchmark interest rate for the first time since 2008. That failed to impress Donald Trump who berated Fed Chair Jay Powell for not cutting rates quickly enough. And as the havoc on the financial markets was unfolding, President Trump was back on twitter defending his administration's tariff war with China and attacking the Fed, calling the chairman clueless.  But if Mr Trump gets what he wants, it may come at a steep price.  The Fed's recent rate cut didn't buoy the markets like it used to. So it's not clear that more rate cuts will blunt the damage from his ongoing trade war with China which is creating uncertainty and raising costs for businesses and consumers. Earlier on Wednesday, White House trade adviser Peter Navarro told Fox Business Network the central bank should cut rates by half a percentage point ""as soon as possible"", an action he claimed would lead to stock markets soaring. Despite the US delaying the 1 September imposition of tariffs on some Chinese imports into the US, it has done little to ease concerns.  ""The challenge is that Trump's trade policy has proven so erratic that you cannot relieve the sense of uncertainty,"" said Tim Duy, an economics professor at the University of Oregon.  As of September last year, the US central bank had a relatively rosy outlook for the economy, expecting that the stimulus from the Trump administration's massive $1.5tn tax cut package and spending in 2018 would sustain growth and justify steadily higher interest rates. Mr Trump wants to make the economy a central part of his case for his 2020 re-election campaign. In an interview scheduled to air on Fox Business Network on Friday, former Fed chief Janet Yellen said she felt the US economy remained ""strong enough"" to avoid a downturn, but ""the odds have clearly risen and they are higher than I'm frankly comfortable with""."
Bond Market Volatility,Holyrood Budget: growing pains,2024-09-14,2017-12-15,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-42363801,"A good budget requires a rabbit to be pulled from the finance minister's hat. That's ""good"" in the journalist's sense that it's at least interesting. As a financial magician, Derek Mackay still has plodding patter. Last year's budget speech from the finance secretary, likened to a pupil reading a lesson at the school carol service but only under protest, had improved to the point of sounding a bit like Jackanory. But when he reached into his hat of magic tricks to give his budget a bit of wizardry, it seemed as if said rodents had been breeding. Like rabbits. Not one new tax band, but two. A rate hike here, a cut there, contriving to make Scotland both the highest and lowest taxed part of the UK. By the time he sat down, Mr Mackay's bunnies were hopping all over Holyrood and beyond, their whiskers twitching at the prospect of some green shoots for a nibble.  Unfortunately, those are the frosty winter shoots on which an economic recovery depends. At first glance, this looked a politically astute budget. Going further than expected for the NHS. A raft of measures to please the business lobbyists. A big wad for rural broadband.  Most of those who speak for business were willing to welcome most measures, particularly on business rates. The tourist sector was particularly positive about both business rates being linked to a lower inflation index, and broadband reaching hotels on the periphery. Housebuilders like the business rate changes too, and a small cut to the Land and Buildings Transaction Tax levied on first time buyers. But the rest of the property sector was disappointed there wasn't more change to the LBTT, which has put a dampener on things towards the upper end of the market. Engineering Scotland liked the look of more research funding. The Scottish National Investment Bank is seen positively. The Federation of Small Businesses saw some positives, but remarked that it had sought ""ballast in choppy markets, but instead the Scottish government steered into uncharted economic waters"". Experts and analysts have more doubts than business. Reform Scotland, the think tank, thinks the tax cuts bring unnecessary risk and could lead to lower revenue.   IPPR Scotland reckons a lot of the tax cut on low earners will go to second, part-time earners in better off households, who may not be the most deserving. The Chartered Institute of Taxation noted the potential for some anomalies, as the new starter rate becomes entangled with the tapering of Westminster's benefits system. Hargreaves Lansdowne, the wealth managers, note that tax relief on pensions may now require a lot more paperwork. Politically, the tax reform showed Scotland can go its own way, without necessarily frightening the horses. With a bit of take and give, the reform is expected to bring in an extra £164m - merely 1.3% up on an income tax take of nearly £12bn. It had most of what will be needed to win over the Scottish Green MSPs with whom Mr Mackay hopes to get his budget over the line at Holyrood. But economically, the seismic change to Scotland's income tax is likely to overshadow one very small, very significant number that wasn't even in the budget speech: 0.7%. That's the amount by which the Scottish Fiscal Commission (SFC) expects the economy to grow next year.   For three years after that, growth is forecast to remain below 1%. Way off in 2022, it rises to the unimpressive heights of 1.1%. The UK growth forecast, from the Office for Budget Responsibility, was the main, unwelcome surprise of Phillip Hammond's November budget. Conceding it had been over-optimistic about Britain's return to productivity growth, it adjusted to the reality of very slow improvements. That delivered a growth forecast for next year of a dismal 1.4%. So using parallel assumptions about Scotland's productivity, which has been going backwards of late, the SFC forecasts a growth rate of only half as much. Some of that gap can be explained by faster population growth south of the Border, but not all.  In a cautiously worded document from the SFC, the warnings are stark: ""The growth that has been achieved in recent years has been driven by factors which include a boom in the construction industry, strong labour market growth, a falling savings ration and support form the oil and gas industry. These factors are unlikely to continue to support growth to the same extent in the coming years. ""Future downside risks include the UK's changing relationship with the EU, a weakening outlook for global trade, Scotland's industrial and demographic structure and weak onshore demand linked to activity in the oil and gas sector."" On earnings, it's starker still: ""Real household disposable income [that's the useful stuff that matters, including tax and benefits] is not expected to see any growth until 2020-21 because of a combination of slow wage growth, very limited employment growth and inflation"". And much of this has to do with productivity being so weak, having ""a profound impact on GDP and the Scottish economy as a whole"". This downgrade in growth forecast is measurable when compared with the Scottish government's forecast last February. Things have taken such a downward lurch that the increase in tax rates is wiped out by the reduction in tax revenue. Next year, Derek Mackay's income tax changes are expected to add £164m to the total revenue, yet total revenue is down more than £200m on expectations in February. That gap widens rapidly over subsequent years. By 2021-22, contrasting February's estimate with this month's figures adds £188m from the change to tax bands and rates, yet the total tax take is down by more than £900m - from £14.59bn to £13.66bn. Welcome to the world of tax revenue volatility, or what they sometimes like to call buoyancy. It's an exciting new world for MSPs, but forces them to think much harder about the ways in which growth can be increased. One last question that puzzled me about Derek Mackay's speech. Was this tax rise a one-off or not? Taxpayers who are being asked to pay more might well be willing to accept such incremental change this year, but probably want to know the big picture and the further horizon.  Will higher earners still be paying to counter Westminster's spending squeeze - which is expected to last into the mid-2020s - with further, unending tax hikes?"
Bond Market Volatility,Markets up after Bank of England bond-buying pledge,2024-09-14,2022-09-29,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63070445,"Stock markets in Asia and the US have risen after the Bank of England said it would buy £65bn of UK government bonds. The announcement came after Friday's mini-budget sparked financial market turmoil and the pound plunged. Investors also demanded higher returns on government bonds, or ""gilts,"" causing some to slide in value. Speaking in New York on Wednesday, new UK trade secretary Kemi Badenoch defended the government's economic policies. However, gains early in the trading day tapered off towards the close with Japan's benchmark Nikkei index ending 0.9% higher, Australia's ASX 200 up by 1.4% and the Kospi in South Korea less than 0.1% higher. Hong Kong's Hang Seng reversed earlier gains to trade 0.8% lower. That came after New York's main stock indexes rebounded from a six-day losing streak to end Wednesday's trading day around 2% higher. The pound was down by around 1% at below $1.08, after earlier making strong gains on Wednesday after the Bank of England's bond-buying announcement. The currency hit a record low on Monday after chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng unveiled plans to tax cuts, funded by borrowing, in a push to boost economic growth. Analysts said the Bank's pledge to buy government bonds at an ""urgent pace"" to help restore ""orderly market conditions"" had helped to calm market volatility. ""The Bank of England's intervention has supported market optimism,"" Jun Bei Liu, portfolio manager at Tribeca Investment Partners in Sydney, told the BBC. ""It reversed a previous view of the UK going into a hard landing and debt spiralling out of control,"" she said. Yeap Jun Rong, market strategist at online trading platform IG, said the move had ""provided some much-needed relief to recent market jitters."" In New York, the UK's international trade secretary used her first visit to the US since taking the role to try to shore up investor confidence. ""You would by now have heard the Bank of England is taking short-term measures to provide stability, as is their job,"" Ms Badenoch said. ""And we must look at all of this in the context of the fundamentals, which are that the UK economy is strong and we have a plan, a growth plan to cut taxes, promote enterprise, and cut red tape for business,"" she added."
Bond Market Volatility,Goldman Sachs results beat expectations,2024-09-14,2017-10-17,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-41648796,"US banking giant Goldman Sachs has reported a fall in third-quarter profits following a further fall in bond trading revenue. However, the 26% drop in bond trading revenue was smaller than expected, following a slump of 40% in the second quarter.    Goldman's net income for the quarter fell by 3% from a year earlier to $2.04bn (£1.55bn).   Rival Morgan Stanley posted a stronger-than-expected rise in profits. Net income rose 11% to $1.69bn in the third quarter, helped by record revenues in its wealth management division which offset the decline in trading activity.  ""Our third quarter results reflected the stability our wealth management, investment banking and investment management businesses bring when our sales and trading business faces a subdued environment,"" said Morgan Stanley chief executive James Gorman. Goldman's bond-trading division has seen three consecutive quarters of declines as a result of low volatility in the market for trading fixed income, commodities and currencies.  However, Oppenheimer analyst Chris Kotowski said: ""After two quarters in a row severely missing Wall Street's bond trading estimates, Goldman's 26% decline did not look so bad. ""While we did not see a sharp rebound in (bond) trading, one can, at a minimum, say that this quarter Goldman looked pretty much like everyone else.""   Goldman's bond trading results were of particular interest because it is more dependent on trading than rivals and it does not have a significant retail operation to offset recent declines. The bank's better-than-expected overall results were also fuelled by its performance in private equity investments and from higher fees that it earned through dealmaking."
Bond Market Volatility,Shares of India's 'family silverware' go on sale,2024-09-14,2022-05-04,By Nikhil Inamdar,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-61296184,"Shares in the Indian state-run insurance giant Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) went on sale this week in a $2.75bn (£2.18bn) initial public offering, witnessing strong demand from investors. The government is offering a 3.5% stake in what will be India's largest share sale, despite both the size and valuation of the issue being slashed significantly to reflect current market conditions. The issue was fully subscribed on Thursday, a day after it opened for sale to retail investors, employees and policy holders. The date for share listing is 17 May, the government's Department of Investment and Public Asset Management said. Bids for anchor investors opened on 2 May but share sale for the public opened on 4 May and would close on 9 May. General investors can buy equity shares at a price band set at $11.75-12.36 (£9.38-9.87) per share. The company's policyholders, employees as well as small mom and pop investors will be entitled to an additional discount of up to 60 rupees, according to papers filed by the company with India's securities watchdog.Broking firm Zerodha expects at least 8-12 million additional online trading accounts to be opened by investors keen to apply for the IPO, a 10-15% bump up from the 80 million accounts currently in operation. LIC is nearly as old as independent India. Formed by nationalising and merging 245 private insurance companies, it started issuing policies in 1956, holding a monopoly on India's insurance sector until the turn of the millennium.   More than two decades after private competition was allowed, LIC continues to hold a leadership position, with 66% market share as of 2021.   Its sheer size makes the insurance behemoth a systemically important company for India.    At over $500bn, its asset base is bigger than the GDP of several countries. And with nearly 280 million policies in force, it manages four times more policies than the entire population of the UK.   It is also India's largest asset manager, with massive investments in state and central securities as well as the stock market.   According to the ratings agency CRISIL, LIC's equity investments in listed companies represented 4% of the total market capitalisation of the National Stock Exchange. It has also been the default financier of the government in trying times, bailing out flailing state-run companies.   LIC also owns a sprawling portfolio of real estate across India.   With 1.3 million distributors selling policies across pretty much every nook and corner in India, the ubiquitous ""LIC agent"" has held a unique place in independent India's public consciousness.   Srinivasalu Naidu, a septuagenarian who has sold policies door to door for the past 30 years, told the BBC he was known in his heyday as ""LIC Naidu"", a much revered figure in his village in the southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh.    Agents like him have been critical to the company's growth and mission to build trust and create a savings culture across the remote corners of the country.   ""People didn't buy policies from me just as insurance, they did it as an investment. For their kids' education or wedding. They trusted their life savings with me,"" said Naidu.   Private banking giant UBS estimates 10 out of every 100 rupees saved by Indian households go into LIC, a much larger amount than even the deposits attracted by India's largest bank, the State Bank of India.   Given LIC's social relevance and scaled-down valuation, India's opposition politicians have accused the government of selling ""family silverware"" and prioritising shareholders over politicians.  According to analysts, even at the upper price band, LIC's issue has been valued far lower by the government than its three listed private peers - HDFC Life Insurance Co., SBI Life Insurance Co. and ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Co.   ""It is not justified at all. You should also involve the opposition (in deliberations), when you are disinvesting something like the LIC which is a social security net,"" Dr Shama Mohamed, a spokesperson of the Congress party, told the BBC.   Last month, PM Narendra Modi's government decided to defer the mega IPO amid global stock market volatility due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. It had initially planned to raise about $8b by selling 5% of LIC to fund its widening fiscal deficit - the gap between earnings and expenditure.   Amid surging fuel costs and lower growth projections, the pruned fundraising target is expected to put additional pressure on New Delhi's already stretched finances.  But analysts say the size and price are appropriate given the current environment, with foreign investors pulling out nearly $20bn from Indian equities since October 2021. And the government is confident that LIC's dominant leadership position and fair valuation will attract significant investor interest.    ""Even if we have a bit of a constrained environment, we can still pull it off because that's the kind of optimum demand scenario which exists,"" Tuhin Kanta Pandey, secretary at the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management, told journalists in Mumbai last week.   In the long run, a stock market listing is expected to improve how the firm is run and bring in more transparency.  But at a time when its competitors have all gone digital, LIC's overt dependence on physical distributors has been flagged as a cause of concern by analysts, who believe it will continue losing market share in the years ahead.   ""On the margin front, it will be kind of hard for LIC to compete if it sticks to the distributor model. They will have to re-innovate the company and become relevant for what the insurance market will be tomorrow,"" says Nikhil Kamath, co-founder of Zerodha.   According to economic commentator Vivek Kaul, LIC pays agents twice as much in commissions in the first year, compared to private insurers, which is not sustainable in the longer run.   Covid-19 has also had an impact on the company. Its growth in new business premiums declined significantly as lockdowns disrupted operations, reiterating the need for LIC to significantly leverage technology to drive operating efficiency.   But analysts expect India's young population and massive under-penetration of life insurance to give LIC a long runway for expansion.   According to analysis from the broking firm Anand Rathi, India's protection gap - or the difference between the insurance required and actually available - was 83% or US$16.5 trillion in 2019, the highest in Asia-Pacific, ""thereby presenting a huge potential for growth""."
Bond Market Volatility,What is the US Federal Reserve doing?,2024-09-14,2017-09-20,By Andrew Walker,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-41320675,"The US Federal Reserve has decided to start running down the stock of financial assets it bought in its quantitative easing scheme. Quantitative easing was a policy that the Fed, and other central banks, used to prevent the recession that followed the financial crisis from becoming an even deeper downturn.  It involved buying financial assets with money newly created by the central bank. In the US the assets were bonds or debts issued by the Federal government and by official agencies that support lending to home buyers. One aim of the policy was to reduce the interest rates paid by businesses and households borrowing money.  Normally central banks try to do that by using their own interest rate policies, which in the case of the Fed means a target it sets for overnight borrowing between commercial banks, known as the Federal Funds Rate. But when that official rate got to almost zero, as it did in December 2008, the Fed's policy makers thought that it couldn't, or shouldn't go any lower.  The Fed's own research suggests that its QE policy has helped reduce long term interest rates. The consequence of all that QE is that the Fed now holds about four and a half trillion dollars of assets. Before it started the programme the figure was less than a quarter of that amount.  Assessments of the impact of QE vary, but many economists take the view that it has helped the US economy.  Many also fear it has created a new danger of financial market instability.  Share and bond prices are high. Some argue that there is a bubble that could burst and trigger a new financial crisis.  The Fed's asset purchases mean there has been more demand for the assets it is buying which tends to push the prices up. In addition, the sellers of those assets need to do something with the money they receive. They may repay debt, but in many cases they buy other assets, often assets with more risk of losing money - such as shares or assets in emerging economies. That in turn tends to push their prices up.  That is what lies behind the concerns about possible financial instability.  All the major developed world central banks, apart from Canada's, have used quantitative easing and several are still actively buying financial assets. In the US however, the Fed stopped in 2014.  But that doesn't mean that it stopped buying assets at the time.   Bonds are debts which (mostly) have a repayment or maturity date when the holder receives the face value of the bond from the borrower or issuer of the bond.  The debt is in effect repaid to whoever owns the bond on the date it matures. In the case of US government bond, it's the Treasury that would repay the central bank.  So far, the Fed has used the proceeds of these repayments to buy more bonds in the financial markets keeping its holdings roughly constant.  Now it is going to reduce the amount that it 'reinvests' in that way. So over time, as more bonds mature its holdings of them will decline.  It also means that over time the extra money it created in the first place to buy the bonds will decline.  As an aside it's worth emphasising that the newly created money is not something that can be spent on goods and services. It is money called reserves, which is held in accounts owned by commercial banks at the central bank.  It's used for transactions between banks and is an important part of the financial and monetary system. But other types of business and households can't use this type of money. Having said that, adding to the total amount of reserves can lead to an increase in money held by the public but it is an indirect effect.  Running down the Fed's holdings of assets will also mean that the amount of reserves held by the banks will decline too.  As with interest rate increases the Fed's approach is cautious. There is no hurry to get things back to what might be considered normal. The decline in its bond holdings in the first month will be no more than ten billion dollars, rising gradually over the course of the following year.  We haven't been told what the ultimate level will be. But the Fed has said that the amount of reserves held by the banks when this process is complete is likely to be higher than before the crisis. All the time there is a degree of wariness among central bankers in the US and other developed economies that they could set back the recovery if they were to raise interest rates or change their QE policies too quickly.  There was a warning in 2013 with an episode that came to be known as the ""taper tantrum"". That was a time when the Fed's QE bond purchases were in full swing. The then Chair of the Fed, Ben Bernanke suggested that it might start to slow down the purchases - or taper its QE. That led to significant volatility in financial markets.  It most likely didn't too much lasting economic damage, but it has probably reinforced the cautious instincts of the current Fed Chair Janet Yellen. She certainly doesn't want to see another tantrum. She has said she wants the Fed's unwinding of its QE to be like ""watching paint dry"". "
Bond Market Volatility,China’s wine hangover,2024-09-14,2014-02-20,Rob Budden,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20140220-chinas-wine-hangover,"Understanding wine funds There are around a dozen or so specialist wine funds worldwide which can be bought and sold through brokers or direct. You’ll pay a one-off subscription charge of around 5% and funds charge annual management fees — typically between 1.5% and 2% of your total investment― for access. Some funds also charge performance fees of about 20% of any gains above a set return, typically 6% per annum. While a fund diversifies the investments in types of wine, which can lower volatility, some risks remain. Some funds, most notably the Vintage Wine fund in the Cayman Islands, have been forced to close down after a spate of redemptions by investors. This fund peaked at over 100m euro ($137 m) and was invested heavily in Burgundy wines but is now liquidating its portfolio. Funds that adopt an open-ended structure, which means the fund's size expands or contracts depending on whether investors are buying or selling, are most at risk. Rapid sales by investors can shrink the fund so much that annual management charges no longer cover the fixed costs of running the fund.  Is 2014 the year wine merchants and investors are finally able to snap up bargain bottles of excellent vintages? It’s a question many are asking after what wine market experts describe as a clear plateau for prices. Fine wine prices are still reeling from Chinese buyers souring on the market. Those buyers and others across southeast Asia helped lift prices to record highs back in late 2008. But since then, the market has experienced its toughest period on record, with traded prices―typically cases of wine― falling for a third consecutive year. According to London-based data analysis firm, Liv-ex, which tracks wine prices for professional investors around the globe, the market fell 15% in 2011, followed by a 9% decline in 2012. Although in 2013, the market saw only a 1.4% dip. The fine wine market, estimated to be worth several billion dollars annually, remains dominated by the big household names ―Bordeaux, Burgundy and Champagne― and attracts both drinkers and investors. Indeed wine analysts say how important both consumption and investment demand are in driving prices up or down. While the attractions for consumers are obvious, what draws investors in to the sector are a history of double digit returns and another way of diversifying their investments. Chateau Lafite Rothschild was the poster child of this China boom with even “poor vintages” soaring to around £8,000 ($13,000) a case from around £2,500 ($4,125) before the Chinese started entering the market in 2008, according to Justin Gibbs, co-founder of Liv-ex. Prices paid by an investor today for similar vintages have now settled back to around £5,000 ($8,250) a case, he said. Even so, over the last 30 years wine has produced 12% compound annual returns according to Liv-ex. “Ultimately wine is a play on global growth,” said Gibbs. “As people get richer they consume more fine wine.” With global wealth generally on the rise, wine analysts expect prices to resume their upward trend later in 2014. Even so, that trend will be fuelled not by Chinese investors. Few expect the Chinese to return in their droves – many stopped buying in mid 2011 put off by a proliferation of fake wines filtering through to the market and the beginnings of a crackdown on giving wine as corporate gifts by a new government. Wine experts say the next big buyers of fine wine will likely come from India, Africa or possibly even South America. In previous decades, when major regions entered the fine wine market it led to a bull-run for prices. Buyers from the United States in the 1960s and '70s helped send prices up around six-fold in the 15 years to 1975.And from the beginning of the 1990s to the peak of the market in October 1997, buyers from Japan helped usher in more dramatic price increases of around 24%annually. Buying smart There are two primary ways of investing in wine: buying actual cases or bottles and storing them until sale or simply putting money into wine funds. Fine wine expert Matthew Tipping of London-based wine merchant Berry Brothers and Rudd said investors who buy wine directly should ensure that it is stored professionally to maintain its value (you will pay, typically, £12 to £15 or $20 to $25 per year, to store a case). Look for a wine merchant with a long history and ensure the wine is stored in your own name, offering protection for the investment should the merchant go bust. Tipping also recommends buying and holding full cases; selling individual bottles can significantly reduce value. Also, keep in mind you will also incur transaction costs (private buyers will typically face spreads of 10% to15% on sought after wine cases, even higher on less mainstream stock). The main exit routes for investors are selling via auction or through a merchant or wine broker. For those looking to buy wine to store and later sell, the key is choosing the right region, maturity, vintage and wine grower, according to wine fund managers and analysts. Wine funds can offer the advantage that they allow people with more modest sums to invest a greater diversification across vintages, regions and growers and hence less volatile performance. These investors also gain access to an investment professional who is constantly monitoring prices and selecting wines they hope will outperform the wider market. Tipping, of Berry Brothers — which has traded wine since 1698 — said that 18 months ago, around 90% of the investing and trading market was purely in Bordeaux wines. The remainder was made up largely of Champagnes, Burgundies and so-called 'Super Tuscans', a label for more forward thinking wines from the Chianti region, said Tipping, which means the producers adopt more flexible rules for blending wine varieties and grapes. Today Bordeaux trading has fallen to just 78% of the entire market for trading as investors have switched to other varieties such as Burgundy, according to Liv-ex. This is an unusually low figure and has seen Bordeaux prices sink 30% from their peak in June 2011. Some wine investors, however, predict this year could see Bordeaux return to favour, opening an opportunity for savvy buyers. This type of volatility is problematic, though, for the average investor, and highlights the risks of wine investing in the medium term, although many wine experts continue to extol the virtues of the asset class as a longer-term diversification tool for conventional share and bond investment portfolios. Over shorter periods of two to three years or less, wine as an asset class displays remarkable correlation with stock markets according to Liv-ex's Gibbs. Since 2011, fine wines have closely tracked the Shanghai Composite index for example, China's main equity benchmark, Gibbs added. While wine has displayed an even closer correlation with Japanese equities, said Chris Smith, investment manager at the London-based Wine Investment fund, which holds around $50m of stock. Since 2008, wine prices have closely tracked Japan's Nikkei stock market index, he said, with only small signs of diversion over the last year. This close correlation may be a sign of the country's continued influence on the fine wine market globally. After the UK, Japan remains one of the biggest buyers of fine wines in the world and Tokyo has more Michelin-starred restaurants than London, Paris and New York combined, Smith said. Some investors are betting that quantitative easing initiatives in the UK, US and Japan, will herald a return to inflation and could also impact wine pricing. They believe global markets are yet to feel the full force of the extra dollars pumping extra liquidity in to the economy which could lead to a delayed reaction and the return of inflation. At which point inflation-busting asset classes such as gold – and wine – would likely return to favour. While a nightmare for central bankers, this scenario would likely favour fine wines “starting investors looking to inflation proof assets,” Smith says. Gibbs of Liv-ex is full of optimism on the wine market, but he said it might take longer for other merchants to feel safe investing in the market in a big way again. Many wine investors are still licking their wounds following the sharp correction experienced over the last few years. Gibbs concedes: “you won't find many optimistic merchants out there”."
Bond Market Volatility,Dow sheds more than 4% twice in week,2024-09-14,2018-02-08,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42991310,"Wall Street shares slid sharply again on Thursday, compounding losses on the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 which started last week.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by more than 1,000 points for the second time this week, plunging 4.15% to 23,860. The S&P 500 dropped 100.6 points or 3.75% to 2,581, while the Nasdaq slid 274.8 points or 3.9% to 6,777.1. The moves follow a day of losses on all key European exchanges. The 100 share index in London closed down 1.49% at 7,170.69 points. Germany and France fell 2.6% and 2% respectively. The dive extends a sell-off that started last week, as investors started to worry that inflation might rise more quickly than expected, leading policymakers to raise interest rates. On Thursday, the Bank of England seemed to offer support for that view. The bank left interest rates where they were at 0.5% at its meeting, but said a strengthening economy meant interest rates were likely to rise sooner than the markets were expecting. Also worrying markets was a government budget proposal US lawmakers in Congress have announced, which raises spending caps and could fan inflation.  Bond yields in the US have also risen in recent weeks, typically a signal of higher rates. Higher interest rates push up borrowing costs for companies and individuals, which can hurt corporate profits and curb economic activity. The uptick in volatility comes as investors react to the shifting conditions. Thursday's declines mean the Dow and S&P 500 have now fallen by more than 10% from the record highs set in January, a threshold analysts call a correction. Shares in financial, technology and consumer companies led the declines on Thursday, which infected every sector. American Express and Intel were the two biggest losers on the Dow. Analysts, who have said for months that the financial markets were due a correction after a long period of rising prices, urged calm. ""The latest decline takes us back to where we were 17 November,"" said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com, which tracks interest rates. ""We've just given back some recent gains, not wiped out anyone's life savings.""  But the declines have led to questions for President Donald Trump, who had repeatedly boasted of the market's rapid rise in value last year. The White House said on Thursday markets were reacting to data that is good news for the broader economy, including low unemployment and signs of wage growth. ""The president like the rest of the White House is concerned about long term economic indicators and factors,"" a White House spokesman said. ""The fundamentals in terms of the long term are very strong."""
Bond Market Volatility,Risk of £50bn bond sale sparked emergency Bank move,2024-09-14,2022-10-06,By Faisal Islam,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63161404,"The aftermath of the mini-budget could have seen a £50bn fire sale of UK government bonds by funds connected to the pensions industry, the Bank of England has said. There was risk of a downward ""spiral"", it said, as increases in the cost of government borrowing hit the funds. The Bank feared these funds would be forced to sell their government debt holdings, adding to the market turmoil. The cost of borrowing saw record increases for two days, the Bank said. The rise in borrowing costs over four days was ""three times larger than any other historical move"". The Bank stepped in to calm markets last week following fears that some types of pension funds were at risk of collapse.  It pledged to buy up to £65bn of government bonds after the mini-budget sparked turmoil on financial markets and the pound plunged. Investors had demanded a much higher return for investing in government bonds, causing some to halve in value. The Bank said that the market in long-term loans to the government lasting three decades, known as 30-year gilts, saw two days where the effective cost of borrowing saw record increases, on its data which starts in 2000.  A letter from the Bank's deputy governor John Cunliffe to the Treasury Select Committee contains a diagram depicting the trigger for the interest rate shock as the ""fiscal event"", another name for the mini-budget, and that the nature of the move in the UK was not seen in the US or eurozone. Jonathan Haskell, a member of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee, also said in a speech on Thursday that ""there was undoubtedly a UK-specific factor"" in the market turmoil. This contradicts the claims made by some government supporters that the mini-budget had nothing to do with last week's turmoil, which was instead caused by ""global factors"". The UK's independent economic forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), had offered to prepare a draft forecast in time for the mini-budget, but the government did not take this up. Mr Haskell added that the Bank uses OBR data in its own forecasts, and a ""sidelined"" OBR ""generates more uncertainty by worsening everyone's information base"". The risk the Bank feared was that the funds connected to the pensions industry, known as Liability Driven Investments, would become forced sellers of their holdings of UK government debt, in an already troubled market. A £50bn sale would represent four times the normal daily trade in the market, and would have pushed the effective cost of borrowing, or yield, even higher than 5%, leading to further problems. Before the mini-budget, this yield had stood at about 3.7%. While individual defined benefit pension funds were not at risk, because they are guaranteed by the sponsoring company, it could have led to a wider financial stability challenge. The Bank of England decided to intervene in the market last Wednesday, bringing down the effective borrowing cost from over 5% to under 4%. As the Bank has eased off its interventions, on Thursday these costs had risen notably again, as high as 4.4%. These rates feed into the costs of long-term mortgages and business lending. The Bank emergency intervention is due to end next week and it has so far bought a fraction of the government bonds it could have, spending just £3.7bn. On Thursday, the Bank said it would wind down its bond buying in ""a smooth and orderly fashion"" once it felt the market was functioning normally again. The Bank also said it is working with the UK's pensions and financial regulators to make sure that that investment strategies used by certain types of pension schemes can withstand market volatility."
Bond Market Volatility,US banks report gains but shares sink,2024-09-14,2018-04-13,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-43758938,"Profits at JP Morgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo rose in the first three months of the year, but their shares slumped on Friday despite the gains. JP Morgan's profits soared 35% year-on-year, with more modest increases reported at Citigroup and Wells Fargo. Analysts said the share decline was a sign investors had already factored in some of the rise. They were expecting more active stock markets and a lower tax rate to boost results. Shares in all three banks sank more than 2% in early trading, providing a sour start to earnings season, when companies report quarterly performance to investors.  JP Morgan reported profits of $8.7bn (£6.11bn) in the period from $6.4bn last year, despite a decline in investment banking. Revenue increased 10% to $28.5bn, as a strong economy boosted activity at its consumer banking unit and the return of market fluctuations boosted trading, leading its equities unit to a record quarter. Citigroup's profits rose 13%, reaching $4.6bn in the quarter from $4.1bn last year.  Revenues in the quarter were $18.4bn, a 3% increase from the same period in 2017. The firm said volatility boosted its equity trading unit, helping to offset a fall in bond trading. As with JP Morgan, investment banking took a hit. Wells Fargo reported preliminary profits of $5.9bn in the quarter, rising 5% from the same period last year. The results were overshadowed by the firm's ongoing problems with watchdogs. Wells said US regulators have proposed to resolve investigations of vehicle insurance and might force it to restate its results. ""At this time, we are unable to predict final resolution ... and cannot reasonably estimate our related loss contingency,"" the bank said. The firm has been under a cloud since revelations that the bank created more than two million fake accounts to meet sales goals and ignored or punished whistleblowers. Then last year, the bank said it had wrongly charged customers for car insurance, among other problems.  In February, the US Federal Reserve, which regulates banks, said it would restrict the firm's growth until it improved its risk management oversight. Revenue slipped from $22.3bn in the first quarter of 2017 to $21.9bn this period, hurt in part by ""customer-friendly"" changes the bank made to card and overdraft fees. "
Bond Market Volatility,Debenhams shares slip as sales dip,2024-09-14,2017-06-27,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-40415445,"Shares in department store chain Debenhams slid 2.3% after it reported falling sales amid ""volatile trading"". Like-for-like sales dropped 0.9% in the 15 weeks to 17 June, and it added that May was ""a tough month for retailers"". It said 2017 profits should be in the expected range, but added that if market volatility continued, profits could be at the lower end of forecasts. Its comments weighed on rival retail shares, with Marks and Spencer down 2%. Staying in the retail sector, Carpetright reported a sharp fall in profits but was upbeat about recent trading Full-year pre-tax profits at the floor coverings specialist sank to £0.9m from £12.8m last year, with much of the fall due to the firm putting aside more money to cover onerous lease costs on loss-making stores. But shares in the company ended the day over 10% higher after it said recent trading had been ""encouraging"" with UK like-for-like sales up 2%. By the end of trading, the benchmark FTSE 100 share index was barely changed, down just 12 points at 7,434.36. On the currency markets, the pound was up 0.5% against the dollar at $1.27870 but was down 0.8% against the euro at 1.12910 euros. The euro jumped on Tuesday morning after a speech by European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi was interpreted as suggesting that the bank's stimulus package - which includes a huge bond-buying programme and negative interest rates - could be tweaked. Mr Draghi noted that the risk of deflation had been averted, although he added that ""considerable"" monetary support was still required."
Bond Market Volatility,Investors wary as Kwarteng fast-tracks economic plan,2024-09-14,2022-10-10,By Daniel Thomas,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63129555,"The chancellor's decision to bring forward the date of his plan to balance the government's finances failed to reassure markets on Monday. Government borrowing costs rose sharply after Kwasi Kwarteng said he would fast-track his plan to 31 October. The plan will set out how he will fund tax cuts and reduce debt after his mini-budget sparked market turmoil. An independent forecast of the UK economy's prospects will be published at the same time. In the wake of the September mini-budget, the pound slumped to a record low, government borrowing costs surged and the Bank of England was forced to step in and take emergency action after the dramatic market movements put some pension funds at risk of collapse. The volatility eased but on Monday the yields - or effective interest rates - on UK government bonds were almost at the levels seen at the height of the market turmoil. Further efforts by the Bank of England to calm markets, along with the appointment of an experienced civil servant as Permanent Secretary to the Treasury also seemed to fall short.  Former Treasury chief Lord Macpherson warned the government that there could be an even tougher response from the financial markets in the coming weeks if the chancellor could not show his sums added up. ""Unless the government can restore economic credibility, the market response in the weeks ahead could be a whole lot worse than we've seen so far,"" he told the House of Lords.   Mr Kwarteng had initially said he would wait for 23 November to give details of his economic plan but faced mounting pressure from his MPs to change course. The new date means Mr Kwarteng's fiscal statement will be published before the Bank of England announces its latest decision on interest rates on 3 November.  The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is widely expected to raise interest rates for the eighth time since last December with many economists forecasting a sharper rise than previous increases.  But Mel Stride, chairman of the Treasury Select Committee, tweeted that he hoped Mr Kwarteng's decision to release the report earlier would result in a smaller rate rise.  He tweeted this would be ""critical to millions of mortgage holders"", Noting that that the plan will be published on Hallowe'en, Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner tweeted: ""Trick or cheat? The Tory horror show rattles on.""  The OBR, the independent budget watchdog, will now publish a report alongside Mr Kwarteng's statement at the end of October. Its forecasts will give an indication of the health of the nation's finances. By Dharshini David, BBC economics correspondent The chancellor bringing forward his explanation of how he intends to get down government debt and the official watchdog's assessment of his plans to Hallowe'en is aimed at quelling the market turmoil which has driven up borrowing costs for households and government.  Providing reassurance on that score will likely mean confirming unpalatable news for others. For most economists reckon that, even if the government can boost growth, it will realistically need to find savings of perhaps £40bn or more, if it is to bring down debt in a few years.  But by anyone's measure that's not small change, it's an amount greater than the defence budget, and won't be raised through efficiency savings. Many public services are already hampered by pandemic disruption and rising inflation. The Institute for Fiscal Studies reckons the latter means departments have to find £18bn from existing budgets just to provide planned services. On top of that balancing act, they'll be bracing for a new wave of austerity. Borrowers have faced paying the price for the markets' lack of faith in the government's plans - millions more may feel the cost of regaining it.  There was some confusion after the chancellor denied there had been any changes to the date of the fiscal statement. However, Treasury sources then clarified that the chancellor would, indeed, bring it forward and that it had simply been waiting to officially announce the change of date in Parliament. Since then the government has been forced into a series of embarrassing climbdowns under growing pressure from its own MPs. Last week, Mr Kwarteng scrapped a decision to cut the top rate of income tax.  And on Monday, James Bowler was announced as the new Permanent Secretary to the Treasury.  Ms Truss fired Sir Tom Scholar, the civil servant who previously held the job and planned to bring in a high profile outsider - a move some feared would further spook the markets.  Ms Truss still faces a potential rebellion from her MPs after declining to say whether she would increase benefits in line with inflation next April.  Her approval ratings have plummeted since the mini-budget. The prime minister says her tax cuts will boost the UK economy after years of lacklustre growth.   But there are fears the government will have to borrow huge sums to fill the spending gap. The cost of government borrowing consequently jumped, as investors demanded higher rates of interest on UK government bonds.  This has fed through to the mortgage market where hundreds of products were pulled due to concerns about how to price these long-term loans.  Last week, interest rates on typical two and five-year fixed rate mortgages topped 6% for the first time in over a decade. On Monday, the Bank of England announced measures to ensure an ""orderly end"" to an emergency bond buying scheme it was forced to launch after Mr Kwarteng pledged additional tax cuts on top of those outlined in the mini-budget. Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that the government and the Bank had launched ""a two pronged attempt to calm markets"" as the pound remained weak and government borrowing costs were rising again. ""Policymakers and politicians are clearly nervous about seeing a repeat of the mini-financial crisis unleashed following the presentation of the Truss administration's slash and spend plans,"" she said.  ""All eyes will be on the independent assessment of his spending plans, and the risk is that if the numbers don't add up, the markets could take fright again."""
Bond Market Volatility,US stocks fall for second consecutive day,2024-09-14,2018-01-30,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42880629,"US markets have suffered a second day of steep losses, as investors dumped health care companies and Apple.  The blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average sank nearly 1.4%, marking its biggest one-day decline in months. The fall followed the news that Amazon, JPMorgan Chase and Berkshire Hathaway would create a new healthcare company with the aim of lowering health costs for their US employees.  Bond yields also rose, reflecting last year's three US interest rate hikes. UnitedHealth Group and Pfizer were the two biggest losers on the Dow, while the insurance company Anthem saw the steepest losses on the S&P 500. Those are among the firms that would be threatened by the emergence of a major new competitor - or signs of a government crackdown on drug prices promised by US President Donald Trump. Apple dipped 0.6% on reports of weak demand for its latest iPhone, and energy firms also came under pressure. But the losses were widespread, touching nearly every sector. The Dow closed down 362.59 points at 26,076.89, while the wider S&P 500 fell 31.1 points or 1.09%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq shed 64 points or 0.86% to 7,402.48. Meanwhile, the closely watched Vix index, which measures volatility based on options prices, also shot up after months of calm, in what some investors say is a sign that more market fluctuation could be coming. The sell-off, volatility and rising bond yields mark a turn for US markets that have been making gains for months, racing past one milestone after another. All three major US indexes are up more than 5% since the start of this month. Eric Wiegand, senior portfolio manager at US Bank Private Wealth Management, said January's rise was driven by higher expectations, as global growth strengthened and the US approved major tax cuts. He said some investors were likely to be cashing in on their gains. They are also reacting to new information as companies update investors on their end of year earnings and provide forecasts for 2018. Others may be worried about the prospect of higher interest rates, which would drive bond yields higher. Bond yields have been relatively low in recent years, helping to make stocks the more attractive investment.  But yields have gained more recently, as the US has raised interest rates. The yield on the 10-year Treasury closed on Tuesday at its highest level since 2014. ""Investors are catching up to the fact that rates have risen,"" said Jonathan Mackay, investment strategist at Schroders. ""The market's finally catching up."" Investors are watching to see if the US Federal Reserve, which is in the middle of a two-day meeting in Washington, will signal when interest rates might rise again.  The bank is about to undergo a change of leadership as Janet Yellen, who is viewed as favouring low interest rates, steps down."
Bond Market Volatility,Bank of England wasn't briefed on mini-budget,2024-09-14,2022-10-19,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63319567,"The government did not tell the Bank of England about its tax cut plans before the mini-budget, one of its deputy governors has said. In the event, the mini-budget sparked market turmoil, with the Bank having to step in to stabilise pension funds.  The Bank could have advised the government on the possible market reaction, Sir Jon Cunliffe said. The government was criticised for bypassing some independent scrutiny of its plans before making them public. The mini-budget, which was put forward by former Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng and Prime Minister Liz Truss, included huge tax cuts but it was unclear how they would be funded. This led to a sharp drop in the pound against the dollar, and spooked investors about government debt, leading to the risk of some pension funds collapsing. The Bank of England was forced to step in to buy government debt to stop a fire-sale by some pension funds of assets which could have led to their collapse. Following the market turmoil, criticism by institutions including the IMF, and a huge drop in the polls for the Conservatives, Mr Kwarteng was sacked by his close political ally Liz Truss. At a meeting with MPs on Tuesday, Sir Jon said the Bank of England had not been consulted on the government plans before they were announced. ""We did not have a full briefing of the package the night before,"" he said. ""Had they asked us what the market reaction would be, we would have interacted with them. ""But it is not our responsibility to give the government advice on fiscal policy. This would have been for the Treasury to advise on the market reaction."" However, he said ultimately the decision on how to proceed lay with ministers. At Prime Minister's Questions in the House of Commons on Tuesday Labour accused Ms Truss of ""crashing the economy"". The prime minister did not address the mini-budget, but said: ""Interest rates are rising across the world and the economic conditions have worsened."" However, according to experts including the Bank of England, the mini-budget on 23 September also had a significant impact on the financial markets. In a letter to MPs on the Treasury Committee on Monday, Sir Jon wrote: ""There has been a particular increase in volatility in UK markets"" and pointed out that: ""The five largest daily moves in the 30-year inflation-linked gilt, in data that dates back to 2000, have all been since the 23 September"", which was when the mini-budget was unveiled. Gilts are a form of IOU which the government sells to borrow money to fund its spending plans. A career Bank of England official like Jon Cunliffe doesn't overstate the situation. But the two key answers he gave the Treasury committee are very serious. He said that the Bank wasn't told about the unpublicised measures in the mini budget, and that had it anticipated a risk to financial stability it would have warned the Treasury. Those are serious because it had every reason to anticipate instability. The day before the mini-budget, the Bank had announced it would start to sell some of the £895bn of government bonds it had bought to try and keep the cost of borrowing down. When more investors buy bonds than sell them, prices rise and the interest rate - known as the yield - drops.  In 2020/2021, the Bank's presence as a buyer in the market was crucial in enabling Rishi Sunak to borrow more than £300bn in to support the economy through Covid, without any offsetting tax rises or spending cuts. The Treasury could borrow vast sums by issuing as many bonds as it liked to investors who didn't insist on higher interest rates to compensate for the risk of lending to a hugely-indebted government - because they could always sell the bonds straight away to the Bank. By contrast, when the mini-budget was announced, there was no such buyer propping up bond prices, and therefore keeping down yields, because the Bank had announced it was now a seller.  That led to chaos. But you only get to hear about potential unintended consequences of budget measures if you ask the people who know."
Bond Market Volatility,Did robots trigger the market plunge?,2024-09-14,2018-02-06,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42959755,"Robot trading has accelerated this week's market dive and may have sparked the sell-off, experts say. Financial firms use computers programmed with complex sets of instructions known as algorithms. They identify trading opportunities and then strike faster than any human could. Algorithmic trading has become so ubiquitous that some estimate well over half of all trading of the S&P 500 Index is done this way.  Such automated trading almost certainly accelerated the sell-off on Monday, which saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average crashing 800 points in ten minutes. ""The explosive speed of the fall ... that is done by machines,"" said Tom Stevenson, Investment Director at Fidelity Personal Investing. Most analysts believe the market tumble was prompted by a report on the US job market, released on Friday, which showed strong wage growth. But the decision to sell on that news may have been made by robot traders. US government bonds, or Treasuries, fell in value after the US jobs report. Yields (the interest that bonds offer investors) rise as prices fall. It's thought that robot traders were waiting for that yield to hit 3% - a significant figure as it could prompt human investors to switch out of shares into bonds. Mr Stevenson said: ""Everyone looks for a reason for why the fall happened. One of them was that bond yields rose up towards the magic number of 3%. ""There seems to have been a trigger at 2.9% for automatic trading to sell and once that trigger was pulled the markets went into freefall."" Piers Curran, head of trading at Amplify Trading, explained that algorithms will be set up to react in certain ways to certain situations. He said: ""One might work by a stop loss criteria, selling an asset as it falls to prevent further losses.  ""So if the Dow Jones Index has dropped 5% it may trigger the machine to sell, but if you have a huge number of these algorithms hitting stop losses at the same time that produces further falls which produce further stop losses."" The algorithmic trading can also be triggered by ""correlation"" trades, when movement in one market will trigger a trade in a different market. Last week an Index called the VIX, nicknamed the Fear Index because it measures stock market volatility, started to rise sharply.  Mr Currant said: ""The VIX was very elevated last week, and doubled on Monday, and because there is often an inverse correlation between the VIX and the Dow Jones Index, the machine trades sold US equities.""  The triggers though can work in the opposite direction.  Many of the algorithms that sold equities on Monday were ""selling short"", that is selling stocks specifically to buy them back cheaper later and net a profit. Steep market falls created by algorithms can create equally steep recoveries. Mr Curran said: ""The markets were reacting to some very specific numbers on Monday, but they are only one set of figures. ""We are going to have to see wages growing strongly in February too and get at least four rises in interest rates this year before we can be sure inflation is going to be that much higher.  ""The market reaction to these single numbers was massively exaggerated because of the machine trades."" Mr Stevenson agreed: ""Algorithmic trading or quant trading does make markets more volatile."" Longer term Mr Stevenson is not pessimistic. ""There are two things that can cause a proper bear market - interest rates rising faster than expected, or a recession,"" he said. ""Rates may rise a little faster but not excessively so. As for a recession, all the evidence, bearing in mind the strength of the US economy, is against it."""
Bond Market Volatility,Market turmoil hits Citigroup revenues,2024-09-14,2019-01-14,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46866751,"US bank Citigroup has blamed the recent turmoil on global markets for a surprise drop in revenue. Fourth quarter revenue slipped 2% to $17.1bn (£13.3bn), falling short of analyst estimates of $17.5bn. The bank said income on its bond trading desks had slumped by a fifth following the fluctuations on financial markets in December. But chief executive Michael Corbat said the lender, which is America's third largest, was making ""solid progress"". ""A volatile fourth quarter impacted some of our market sensitive businesses, particularly fixed income,"" he said.  In the three months to the end of December, profit rose to $4.2bn, or $1.61 a share, from $3.7bn, or $1.28 a share, a year earlier. Citi is the first of the major US banks to post results in 2019, with JP Morgan, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs all due to issue fourth-quarter figures later this week. "
Bond Market Volatility,Bank warning pension help to end worries investors,2024-09-14,2022-10-12,By Tom Espiner & Faisal Islam,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63223894,"Investors remained nervous after the Bank of England insisted its emergency bond-buying scheme would end this week, dismissing reports it may be extended.  It said the help would end on Friday ""as it made clear from the outset"". The Bank is buying bonds to stabilise their price and prevent a sale which could put some pension schemes at risk. Bond sales rose after the statement, with borrowing costs almost as high as when the Bank first stepped in to calm market turmoil after the mini-budget. Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng's plans for huge tax cuts without a clear indication of how they would be paid for sparked a dramatic reaction on financial markets last month. The pound fell to a record low and bond prices also fell sharply forcing the Bank of England to step in to stop their price falling further. The government raises money it needs for spending by selling bonds - a form of debt that is paid back plus interest in anywhere between five and 30 years. Pension funds invest in bonds because they provide a low but usually reliable return over a long period of time. However, the sharp fall in their value after the mini-budget forced pension funds to sell bonds, threatening to create a ""downward spiral"" in their prices as more were offloaded, which left some funds close to collapse. On Tuesday evening Andrew Bailey told pension funds: ""You've got three days left now and you've got to sort it out."" The pound initially fell sharply against the dollar before steadying, after Mr Bailey's surprisingly blunt statement, which dashed hopes the support could be extended.  Mr Bailey told the BBC he had stayed up all night to try and find a way to calm markets and said the Bank was doing everything it could to preserve financial stability, but said it had always been clear that the help would be temporary. He said it was now down to financial firms to arrange their affairs, saying pension funds had ""an important task"" to ensure they are resilient. ""I'm afraid this has to be done, for the sake of financial stability,"" he said. Do you have a question on how you might be affected by the Bank of England's decision? Members of the Bank's Financial Policy Committee (FPC), which helps to protect UK financial stability, said on Wednesday that the governor was crystal clear the bond-buying programme would end, although other support measures would remain in place.  The recent turmoil has already fed through to the mortgage market, where hundreds of products have been suspended as the volatility has made it difficult for lenders to know how to price these long-term loans. Last week, interest rates on typical two and five-year fixed rate mortgages topped 6% for the first time in over a decade. The Bank's FPC said that this was likely to put households under severe pressure next year. Earlier, pensions industry body the Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association had warned against the help ending ""too soon"". It suggested the support should be extended until 31 October, when chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng is due to detail his economic plan explaining how he will balance the public finances. The statement will be accompanied by independent forecasts on the prospects for the UK economy. The government has said it remains confident in its tax cuts plan, with Mr Kwarteng telling MPs he was ""relentlessly focused on growing the economy"" and ""raising living standards"". But Mr Bailey's words further increases the pressure on the government, and the chancellor, to come up with an economically credible and politically viable debt plan, and quickly. Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said: ""This is a Tory crisis that has been made in Downing Street, and that is being paid for by working people."" Former IMF deputy director Mohamed El-Erian told BBC News that the economy was on ""shaky ground"". He said financial systems going into turmoil ""can cause a lot of damage"". In its latest World Economic Outlook report on Tuesday, the IMF acknowledged the mini-budget would ""lift growth somewhat in the near term"", although it would ""complicate the fight"" against the cost-of-living crisis."
Bond Market Volatility,How does Brexit affect the pound?,2024-09-14,2019-01-15,By Howard Mustoe,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46862790,"During the past three years, the pound has had a rough time of things when it comes to its price against the dollar and other currencies. The immediate aftermath of the Brexit referendum saw sterling decline sharply in value. And as the vote on the UK's withdrawal deal from the European Union looms, further volatility is expected. Since June 2016, holidays and imported goods have become more expensive, but UK exports have been cheaper.  It's a complex picture, though.  Exporters, such as carmakers, are importers themselves, buying in raw materials such as oil or copper.  While Britons living abroad but drawing a UK pension have suffered as the pound has declined. Since 1992, the pound has floated freely on currency markets, meaning that traders - buyers and sellers - determine what it's worth. When the pound rises in value, more of the currency is being bought. When it goes down, more is sold.  ""A free-floating currency is a very good thing, because it works as a safety valve,"" says Jane Foley, senior currency strategist at Rabobank. After the global financial crisis, countries whose economies suffered had weaker currencies. ""Countries in the eurozone such as Greece and Spain had a strong euro they couldn't devalue,"" or reduce in value, she added, and for them, the safety valve was wage cuts. ""The downside is when it comes on the back of political uncertainty,"" she said. ""Goods become more expensive."" In recent years, traders have been looking at politics, rather than economic data, which means faster trading, and a faster pace of change in the price. That's the volatility traders talk about. ""If you think abut political uncertainty being bad, the worst outcome is a hard Brexit,"" says Ms Foley, because details of what will happen under those circumstances are so scarce.  ""If that's the worst case scenario, it [the pound] will rally if hard Brexit seems unlikely."" Similarly, talk of putting Brexit on hold has boosted the pound, as it gives businesses more room to plan, she says.  A softer Brexit could be good news for savers, according to CIBC's head of foreign exchange strategy, Jeremy Stretch. Currency experts think that a softer Brexit could provide a boost to the economy by providing confidence and certainty to companies and consumers who in turn may decide to spend more or take on more staff.  That increased economic activity could prompt the Bank of England to raise interest rates, boosting returns for savers.  ""We could see an interest rate hike come the May meeting of the Bank of England, although it may be the case that they wait until August,"" according to Mr Stretch. ""Moving towards a softer Brexit would help to alleviate the uncertainty that was impacting the economy in the latter stages of 2018."" ""Certainly since 2016, sterling is weaker,"" says Ms Foley. ""Our wealth overseas has lessened."" At the bureau de change, rates will be even worse than those on the financial market.  That reflects their business costs including rent, staff, security and having lots of money ready. And if you buy your notes at the airport, convenience. BBC research shows that travellers have seen bureau de change rates fall in recent months as the pound as suffered against other currencies.  But the value of the pound is always reflected in the price of another currency.  Which means that since the referendum there are some currencies against which sterling has performed better, notably the Turkish lira and the Argentine peso. Interest rates and money-printing can also have an effect. Higher interest rates, and therefore returns, may attract more foreign buyers, which pushes up the value of the currency.  Printing money, either literally or through the bond-buying programmes known as quantitative easing, has historically reduced the value of a currency by increasing its supply. But sometimes the effects can be minor. Another factor is the UK's current account deficit, says Jane Foley. That's where imports exceed the value of a nation's exports. A simple way of thinking about it is a deficit of savers, she says. ""We need foreign savers to make up the shortfall. If they don't like what they see, they are more likely to pull their money out."" That means selling pounds and a cheaper currency. ""If we had a surplus, we would not be as vulnerable,"" she says. It explains why the pound is more volatile - why trading happens at a faster rate - than the yen. Japan has much domestic wealth to draw upon. Companies may buy currencies for a variety of reasons. A company wanting to buy a UK-based rival will need lots of sterling to do so. It may have to sell dollars or euros and buy sterling.  Likewise, a company wanting to pay shareholders a slice of profits may need to bring UK sales home. They will sell their pounds. Then you have traders who think they know something others don't. They will make bets on the market, or speculation. ""Customers I see are corporate customers who may have to buy energy, grain or some other component,"" says Ms Foley. ""They have a natural need. It's an easy mistake thinking it's just speculators, making a quick buck."" Events will determine how the pound performs in the short term, until some sort of resolution for Britain's departure from the EU comes about, said Ms Foley.  The vote on Prime Minster Theresa May's Brexit deal will probably be the next event. Market-watchers have typically mixed views. ""The pound will react to the extent and manner of the government's likely defeat in the vote, with a heavier defeat more likely to push down on an exchange rate that has already depreciated a great deal,"" said Gregory Thwaites, research director at WorldRemit and previously Head of International Research at the Bank of England.  ""In the unlikely event that the deal is passed, sterling will be likely to rally."" ""Should the withdrawal act be ratified on Tuesday, sterling will probably surge about 5% in value against the US dollar, but if December's failed attempt is anything to go by then the chances look slim,"" said Simon Harvey, market analyst at Monex Europe. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, said: ""It is expected that the bill will be voted down, but this won't be the most significant factor influencing the pound's direction, it's what will happen next."" He says options as diverse as a no-confidence vote in the government, an extension of Article 50, a new general election and a second referendum could mean very different things for the pound. ""As of now, investors seem to be on wait-and-see mode."""
Bond Market Volatility,Bank of England steps in to calm markets,2024-09-14,2022-09-28,By Daniel Thomas & Noor Nanji,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63061614,"The Bank of England has said it will step in to calm markets after the government's tax-cutting plans sparked a fall in the pound and caused borrowing costs to surge. It warned that if the market volatility continued there would be a ""material risk to UK financial stability"". The Bank will start buying government bonds at an ""urgent pace"" to help restore ""orderly market conditions"". The pound, which has been volatile, rose 1.4% against the dollar to $1.08.  It comes after the currency hit a record low on Monday following the chancellor's mini-budget, which pledged $45bn worth of tax cuts, funded by borrowing, as part of a plan to boost economic growth.   The government borrows money to fund its spending plans by selling bonds, or ""gilts"", to investors such as pension funds and big banks on international markets.  The investor then gets to receive a stream of future payments, or ""yield"", based on the interest rate the government has offered.  Due to concerns over whether the government's plan will work, investors have been demanding much higher interest rates to lend to the UK government. But the Bank now hopes to lower these prices by buying its bonds.  The government's long-term borrowing costs fell after the bank's intervention on Wednesday, although still remains high. The Bank of England was forced to intervene after the market turmoil put pressure on pension funds, which invest in government bonds because they are usually so stable. So called Liability Driven Investment funds - which support defined benefit pensions schemes - were facing a collapse in the value of the bonds they hold, which in turn could have forced them to rush to sell other assets, sparking yet more market panic. However, industry group the Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association (PLSA) said that ""pension schemes are long-term investors and moments like this come from time to time"". ""While this is a complex situation as there has been a lot of volatility in the gilt markets in recent days, we would not expect any significant issues for savers,"" said Joe Dabrowski, deputy director of the PLSA. Nevertheless, he said there will be ""some operational challenges and pressures on liquidity"" in the short term. Mr Dabrowski added that ""this is not ideal, [but] they are challenges that can be overcome and the statement from the Bank of England is a helpful step to achieving that"".  The Bank has already said it will ""not hesitate"" to hike interest rates to try and protect the pound and try and stem surging prices. Some economists have predicted the Bank of England will raise the interest rate from the current 2.25% to 5.8% by next spring.  The projection has led hundreds of mortgage products to be taken off the market.  The Bank said its bond purchases would be ""time limited"" and carried out on ""whatever scale is necessary"" to ease investor concerns. It will also postpone the planned start of a gilt sale programme that was only announced last week.  Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said the Bank had been forced to step in to avoid the early stages of a financial crisis and warned fears over the economic outlook were growing.  ""This shows that the Bank is going to do all it can to prevent a financial crisis and it is already working. While this is welcome, the fact that it needed to be done in the first place shows that the UK markets are in a perilous position.  ""It wouldn't be a huge surprise if another problem in the financial markets popped up before long."" Despite the Bank's action, the pound continued to fall with some analysts warning it could even reach parity with the dollar.  ""What today shows us, is that the market doesn't see this as a problem that just the Bank of England can clean up,"" she said. ""This is just firefighting,"" said Jane Foley, a currency strategist at Rabobank. She said pressure was growing on the government to make clear the financial cost of its tax cut and spending plans. There has been widespread criticism of the government's plan, with International Monetary Fund warning on Tuesday that the measures are likely to fuel the cost-of-living crisis and increase inequality. The government says it will not reverse its tax cuts, but has promised to release further plans to boost growth and reduce public debt on 23 November. In a statement, the Treasury acknowledged global financial markets had seen ""significant volatility"" in recent days. It said Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng was ""committed"" to the Bank's independence, adding: ""The government will continue to work closely with the Bank in support of its financial stability and inflation objectives."" But Labour called on the chancellor to urgently clarify how he planned to stabilise the economy. Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said people would be ""deeply worried"" about the cost of their mortgage, about their pensions, and the cost of living. ""The Chancellor must make an urgent statement on how he is going to fix the crisis that he has made."" This is an immense show of force from the Bank of England trying to calm borrowing markets. It does raise some questions. It underlines that this is a crisis, and the Bank has responded in emergency mode. The clear cause of this crisis was the chancellor's mini budget, leading to a loss of market confidence and spiralling borrowing rates on government debt, which it says could become a ""material risk to financial stability"". So it will now, for a temporary period, buy up those loans in unlimited quantities. The effective interest rate being charged to the UK government in these markets was spiralling to 20 year highs. That has now fallen back. But it was not a decision made by the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee, who were informed of the decision after it was made by the Bank's financial experts. It actually comes as the Committee had been set to enact the exact reverse policy - selling government debts. The process was due to start next week and has been delayed. It is a massive intervention, but it could confuse markets about the clarity of policy making and lines of accountability. Sterling has fallen sharply again, close to all time lows. This will not solve the government's problems. It might buy them some time."
Bond Market Volatility,Scottish independence: a choice of uncertainties,2024-09-14,2022-10-17,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-63293427,"The astonishing reversal of the Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng budget threatened to eclipse an important day for the cause of Scottish independence. Jeremy Hunt was sidelining a prime minister who is little more than a month in the job, while sucking much of the air out of news media space. But with eclipse came opportunity. The new Chancellor of the Exchequer was also providing the latest episode in a series of events that could hardly have done more to weaken the case for Scotland remaining in the UK because of its long-standing stability, a reputation for good governance or its international standing. Speaking from her Bute House official residence, Nicola Sturgeon slotted home that shot at an open goal, before embarking on an economic case which sought to balance attack with defence. On the front foot, the document offers a vision of a fairer, green Scottish economy. Lots of Scots can sign up for the list of improvements. They reflect on what is perceived to be a different consensus or middle ground in Scottish politics. But the vision is little more than a wish list. We can attach our own preferences, and project them on to this blank screen of possibilities. To make them into a reality requires the choosing of priorities, building of alliances, in many cases finding the funds, and addressing the areas where there are potential trade-offs. For instance, you can raise minimum wages for young people, but in a less tight labour market than we currently have, what if that prices them out of the market for jobs which can be done by someone with more experience?  More obviously, while there are positives about membership of the European Union - freedom to live and work in the EU among them, and to recruit from the EU - there are negatives about the potential trade friction with the rest of the UK.  Nicola Sturgeon's defences are taking more time and effort. The transition to a new currency remains a hard one to sell to the public, when so much of the plan is uncertain, and it depends on moving parts over which even an independent country has little or no control. The gap between spending levels and estimated tax take from Scots starts off at an unsustainable level. And if those aspirations for a different type of economy are to be met, the gap can be expected to grow. The plan promises the kind of fiscal discipline rules and institutional safeguards that are intended to avoid the debacle that befell the Truss/Kwarteng budget. But by pointing to the volatility of figures throughout Covid and now the surge in inflation, they decline to say how tight the squeeze might be on spending. Until the Scottish Fiscal Commission gets to look at the actual numbers facing an independent Scottish government, we won't have an independent assessment of whether the hoped-for growth is likely to materialise. Both of these issues are highlighted by the Institute for Fiscal Studies. The economic blueprint ""makes all the right noises on how the public finances would be managed, emphasising achieving fiscal sustainability,"" says the IFS's David Phillips. ""But it skirts around what achieving sustainability would likely require in the first decade of an independent Scotland: bigger tax rises or spending cuts than the UK government will have to pursue."" He goes on to say that Scotland could grow its way out of Britain's low productivity, ""but boosting productivity and growth is far from certain and would be easier said than done. ""Experience from recent weeks [in Downing Street] suggests the markets may not look favourably on fiscal plans built on the uncertain hope of a substantial future boost to growth."" These are not new challenges, and nor are the policies newly minted. They are close to the position adopted by the SNP when its policy absorbed the whole of the  Sustainable Growth Commission in 2018. That set out the route from sterling to a Scottish currency, and illustrated it with at least nine years of spending being squeezed.   Other significant changes since the 2014 referendum include Europe, with Brexit forcing a different approach. It is the main justification for pushing the case to another vote. Becoming a member offers a trading advantage over the rest of the UK. But it presents the problem of the England-Scotland frontier becoming a hard border. Oil and gas is no longer to be the fountain of cash with which to balance the books. But old habits die hard. While Ms Sturgeon is against further oil and gas developments and would not use oil revenues for day-to-day spending, she is looking to its tax revenues to fill up a big trust fund, while she's already allocating the earnings from that investment fund many years in advance. There was another change in the economic case being made. It was an injection of candour about the difficulties and uncertainties.  Eight years ago, questions and doubts were brushed aside as ""Project Fear"". Nicola Sturgeon now acknowledges the right that people have to question and to doubt, and the responsibility she has to provide persuasive answers. Back in 2014, Alex Salmond said he knew the minds of Whitehall ministers, and would bend their opposition to his will through the force of his negotiating skills. After the experience of Brexit, it's harder to argue that such negotiations would be easy. Ms Sturgeon knows there are uncertainties. What has significantly shifted in her favour is that the UK also brings an unprecedented period of uncertainty. Brexit is a journey to an unknown destination. The governing party at Westminster is severely weakened and divided by events of recent weeks. A referendum this time next year would not be a choice between radical change and the status quo, but between two routes - both quite radical and both quite risky. This would not be a choice between certainty and uncertainty, says Nicola Sturgeon, but between different uncertainties. The question, she adds, is how best to navigate them. On an issue of profound division in Scotland, the first minister might even get agreement on that much."
Bond Market Volatility,Bank's £65bn move driven by pension fund panic,2024-09-14,2022-09-28,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63065415,"The Bank of England stepped in to calm markets after some types of pension funds were at risk of collapse. It pledged to buy £65bn of government bonds after Friday's mini-budget sparked turmoil on financial markets and the pound plunged. Investors had demanded a much higher return for investing in government bonds, causing some to halve in value. Pension funds, which invest in bonds, were forced to start selling, sparking fears of a fresh market downturn. The Bank said its decision to buy government bonds at an ""urgent pace"" was driven by concern over ""a material risk to UK financial stability."" The government borrows money to fund its spending plans by selling bonds, or ""gilts"", to investors such as pension funds and big banks on international markets. But a collapse in the price of those bonds was forcing some pension funds to sell gilts and assets, further forcing down the price. If that process had continued, there was a risk that those pension funds could have got to a position where they couldn't pay their debts. To stop this from happening the Bank said it would buy around £65bn of gilts on Wednesday. Joe Dabrowski, deputy director of industry group the Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association, said: ""While this is a complex situation as there has been a lot of volatility in the gilt markets in recent days, we would not expect any significant issues for savers."" This is an immense show of force from the Bank of England trying to calm borrowing markets. It is already having an impact. It also raises some questions. First and foremost it underlines that this is a crisis, with the Bank responding in emergency mode. The clear cause was the chancellor's mini-budget, leading to a loss of market confidence, and spiralling borrowing rates on government debt. That crash in the value of loans to the government threatened to become a ""material risk to financial stability"", says the Bank. Read more here. The Pensions Regulator said it is monitoring financial markets closely for their impact on the funding of defined benefit, or final salary pension schemes, a spokesperson said. ""We welcome steps announced by the Bank of England to restore orderly conditions through temporary purchases of long-dated UK government bonds,"" the spokesperson added. The pound hit a record low on Monday following the chancellor's mini-budget, which pledged £45bn of tax cuts as part of a plan to boost economic growth.  The level of government borrowing required had shocked investors who questioned the sustainability of the public finances. UK government bond markets and stock markets, which had seen sharp falls, stabilised after the Bank's announcement and the pound also rose slightly. The government has insisted it is standing by its plan despite growing criticism. Treasury minister Andrew Griffith said on Wednesday that its tax cuts were the ""right plans"" to grow the UK economy. He said the Bank of England had ""done their job"" by announcing it would buy government debt to stabilise the economy. It came after the International Monetary Fund openly criticised the government's tax cut plans, warning that the measures were likely to fuel the cost-of-living crisis and increase inequality. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused the government of ""losing control of the economy,""  ""What the government needs to do now is recall Parliament and abandon this budget before any more damage is done,"" he said. While the government says it will not reverse its tax cuts, it has promised to release further plans to boost growth and reduce public debt on 23 November. In a statement, the Treasury said it would continue to work closely with the Bank ""in support of its financial stability and inflation objectives."" Former IMF deputy director Mohamed El-Erian told the BBC's Newsnight that UK policy had been ""incredibly incoherent"", with the government and the Bank of England working at cross-purposes. Meanwhile, chief secretary to the Treasury Chris Philp confirmed on Wednesday that government departments are being asked to find spending cuts. Speaking on ITV's Peston, Mr Philp said government departments are being asked to ""look for efficiencies wherever they can find them"". The efficiencies will ""stick to the targets"" of the 2021 Comprehensive Spending Review, Mr Philp said. Any savings will ""enable us to target spending on things that target growth,"" he said. Ministers have not decided whether benefits will rise in line with inflation in the autumn, he added. Mr Philp rejected calls for the OBR report on the mini-budget to be published, saying projections will be held until the 23 November to ensure they are done ""in a way that's organised and thoughtful""."
Bond Market Volatility,Bank boosts plan to reassure investors,2024-09-14,2022-10-10,By Nick Edser,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63198341,"The Bank of England has announced new measures aimed at ensuring an ""orderly end"" to its emergency bond buying scheme which was introduced to stop a collapse of some pension funds.  The Bank will increase the amount of bonds it can buy in the final week of the scheme, which ends on Friday.  It will also introduce extra support to ease future strains on pension funds.  The Bank initially stepped in after the government's mini-budget sparked turmoil on financial markets. With the deadline for the Bank's bond-buying programme fast approaching, there have been concerns volatility would return once the scheme ends. However, Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said the Bank was taking the approach of ""talking loudly and carrying a big stick"" in its attempt to calm concerns, He said the measures are ""designed to reassure pension managers - and pension holders - that help will be provided"".  He added that the Bank's announcement reaffirms that the bond purchases were a short-term measure and ""it remains committed to withdrawing monetary stimulus and tightening monetary policy as it fights inflation"". The mini-budget - which was announced on 23 September - pledged £45bn of tax cuts as part of a plan to boost economic growth, but the level of government borrowing required shocked investors who questioned the sustainability of the public finances. In the aftermath of the statement, the pound hit a record low and investors demanded a much higher return for investing in government bonds, causing some to drop sharply in value. Certain types of funds in the pension industry, which invest in bonds, were forced to start selling, sparking fears of a fresh market downturn. On 28 September, the Bank stepped in to buy government bonds saying its decision was driven by concern over ""a material risk to UK financial stability"". It said it would buy up to £65bn bonds, with a limit of £5bn a day. So far, the Bank has bought only around £5bn bonds in total under the programme and in its latest announcement it said stood ready to increase the size of its daily purchases. On Monday, it doubled the limit to £10bn. This intervention is about a transition off the Bank of England emergency support offered in government bond markets, in the aftermath of the mini-budget. The Bank of England is trying to leave no stone unturned in making sure the withdrawal of this support occurs in an orderly manner. But the Bank is also committing to the timetable to phase out the support this week. Some in the markets had anticipated it would need to be extended. The Bank is demonstrating that this intervention is not intended to limit the rise in government costs, but instead was a temporary and targeted effort aimed at maintaining financial stability. This is the message heard in markets on Monday, with effective borrowing costs, or yields, on government debt on the rise again. These rates were over 4.5% for borrowing over 30 years and five years. The big picture is this: if the Treasury wants to bring down now rising government borrowing costs - which have an effect on mortgages and business lending too - it is up to it to present a credible set of tax and spending plans and independent forecasts, which are now promised for the end of October. The forecasts and the plan will now feed into the Bank of England's interest rate decision in early November. The Bank of England's intervention was a temporary bridge over a specific crisis. The solution here is for the government. The government borrows money to fund its spending plans by selling bonds, or ""gilts"", to investors such as pension funds and big banks on international markets. But a collapse in the price of those bonds in the aftermath of the mini-budget was forcing some funds to rush to sell bonds further forcing down the price. If that process had continued, there was a risk that those pension funds could have got to a position where they could not pay their debts. In its latest statement, the Bank said there had been ""substantial progress"" in addressing the financial problems facing these funds, which had faced the prospect of having to make forced sales of £50bn of bonds. As well as increasing the daily limit on bond purchases this week, the Bank also announced a further measure to help the funds affected by the recent market volatility. Under the measure, these funds will be able to use a wider range of assets - such as company bonds - to access money to help meet any short-term financial demands. It is hoped this means these funds will not be forced to sell government bonds to raise cash, which was what they had to do in the immediate aftermath of the mini-budget. This measure will continue after the emergency bond-buying programme has finished. Before the mini-budget, the yield on government borrowing over a 30-year period stood at about 3.7%. The yield is effectively the interest rate. After the mini-budget it jumped to 5.1% until the Bank's intervention pushed the rate back down. However, in recent days it has crept back up again to around 4.5%."
Bond Market Volatility,FTSE 100 suffers worst year since financial crisis,2024-09-14,2020-12-31,By Simon Read,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-55500103,"Pension savers and investors' nest-eggs have been hit as the UK's leading share index had its worst year since the height of the financial crisis. The FTSE 100 index fell 14.3% over the year, marking its worst performance since 2008, when it slumped 31.3%. Despite the poor performance, the blue-chip index has recovered significantly since the start of the global pandemic when it was a third lower than now. Analysts have said that next year is likely to be better for investors. ""The factors which worked against the FTSE-100 in 2020 - the pandemic, a deep recession and Brexit - will start to fade into the background, giving corporate profits, dividends and employment a chance to bounce back,"" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. Such market volatility can be alarming, but people should not panic. Anyone who sold shares back in March would have missed out on the market's gains we've seen since, for instance. Market movements don't only affect savers with shares or funds that invest in the stock market. They also affect anyone with a pension scheme, as the money we stash for our retirement is invested on our behalf in the market. That means millions of workers in the UK are relaying on stock market returns for their financial future. Seasoned investors and fund managers are constantly taking action to protect their portfolio. That can mean moving cash out of risky markets or moving into safer cash havens, such as bonds. It's essential to diversify and not back just one investment opportunity, which is what funds are all about. By avoiding having all your savings in one basket - or share - then you avoid falling prey to the worst volatility of stock markets. ""The coronavirus market downturn spurred many young people to dip a toe into the world of investments for the first time - perhaps because they have been at home more,"" pointed out Myron Jobson, personal finance campaigner at Interactive Investor. ""The key for investors of all ages is to ensure that your portfolio is well diversified across assets, sectors and regions so that you are not overexposed to risk in any one part of the market."" ""If 2020 taught us anything it's that predicting short-term movements in the stock market is impossible,"" Robin Powell, editor of The Evidence-Based Investor told the BBC. ""Investors should check that they're happy with the level of risk they're taking, and if they are, they should ignore the noise and stay invested, rebalancing periodically."" He advises people to have a portfolio you can stick with through thick and thin, diversified across regions and sector, and that includes a percentage of government bonds to dampen the risk. ""And don't pay for help from anyone who thinks they know where markets are heading. They have no more of a clue than you do,"" he cautioned. Mr Mould conceded that it has been hard to find a decent return in 2020 with interest rate cuts, falling returns from National Savings products and lower Government bond yields. But if you put your money overseas, the story could have been different. ""Japanese and US stock markets both had solid years and America's tech-laden Nasdaq soared by over 40%,"" he pointed out. That's a point taken up by Michael Baxter, economics commentator for The Share Centre. ""Compare the FTSE-100 with the US equivalent,"" he said. ""The S&P 500 surged this year hitting a new all-time high. By contrast, the FTSE 100 fell sharply."" He attributes that to the tech sector making up a high proportion of the US index. ""The COVID-19 crisis has accelerated a trend that was already in place before, namely the adoption of digital.  ""By contrast, the FTSE 100 is made up too many companies with their base stuck in the past, trying to promote 20th century business models in the 21st century and Covid just served to make a bad situation worse."""
Bond Market Volatility,Shares hit record amid trade talk hopes,2024-09-14,2019-07-01,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48828230,"The S&P 500 index of US stocks has closed at a record high amid signs of progress in US-China trade talks. The index closed at 2,964.33, beating 21 June's previous high, with technology stocks driving the rise.  Market watchers say more optimism around a potential trade deal between the US and China led to the movement. And gold, often seen as a safe asset in times of uncertainty, fell 2% to $1,382 per ounce, the biggest drop since June 2018. The Dow Jones closed 0.44% higher at 26,717.43, while the Nasdaq finished 1.1% higher at 8,091.16. In Europe, both the UK's FTSE 100 index and Germany's Dax closed 1% higher. ""We're right back on track,"" US President Donald Trump said after the countries agreed to restart trade talks.  ""Gold tends to do well during times of concern over growth, market volatility or when markets think the powers-that-be are losing control of events,"" said Russ Mould, investment director at stockbroker AJ Bell. ""A trade deal would deal with all three issues and markets are happy to take the view that a deal is coming. Though it could still be a long time coming, if there is to be one at all."" Negotiations between China and the US have dominated market moves for months as positive statements are often followed by extra tariffs, sending stock, currency and commodity markets up and down. The latest moves follow a pledge to renew talks between the US and China, an agreement that was reached at the G20 summit in Japan. US President Donald Trump agreed to hold off on $300bn of new tariffs on goods and relaxed restrictions on Huawei, while China agreed to make new purchases of US farm equipment. Last year, the US imposed three rounds of tariffs on more than $250bn worth of Chinese goods. China hit back by imposing tariffs ranging from 5% to 25% on $110bn of US products. A truce agreed last December collapsed and in May the US raised tariffs on $200bn of Chinese products to 25% from 10%. Again China retaliated with tariff on $60bn of US goods. The price of gold is also retreating after gaining 8% in June, with prices exceeding $1,400 per troy ounce. ""Gold has just had a strong run. Nothing goes up in a straight line,"" said Mr Mould. While it earns no income, like a share or a bond would, gold's indestructible nature and its place in history as a store of value make it attractive to some investors in times of strife. Other safe-haven assets also declined, including the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc. The dollar rose 0.4% against the yen to 108.26, and advanced 0.7% on the franc to 0.9830 francs."
Bond Market Volatility,Rees-Mogg says market turmoil not due to mini-budget,2024-09-14,2022-10-12,By Beth Timmins,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63230001,"Jacob Rees-Mogg has claimed market turmoil is not linked to the mini-budget in which the chancellor announced big tax cuts without the usual analysis of the economic impact. The business secretary said volatility was ""more to do with interest rates than a minor part of fiscal policy."" He said the Bank of England had not raised rates as fast as the US. But economists and some MPs said the plans had worried investors, pointing to the surge in borrowing costs. Investors are often wary of putting money into countries that are increasing their debt. And if a country raises its interest rates it means investors will get a bigger return on their money if they put it into that country's banks and assets. After the mini-budget, the pound plunged and government borrowing costs surged. ""What has caused the effect in pension funds... is not necessarily the mini-budget. It could just as easily be the fact that the day before the Bank of England did not raise interest rates as much as the (US) Federal Reserve did,"" he said. ""Jumping to conclusions about causality is not meeting the BBC's requirement for impartiality"" he said, after a suggestion the chancellor's actions had been the trigger for the fluctuations in the value of the pound and government bonds. At the first PMQs since the mini-budget, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused Prime Minister Liz Truss of ""ducking the question"" when asked whether she agreed with the business secretary. Ms Truss said the government had taken ""decisive action"", adding ""as a result of our action... we will see higher growth and lower inflation."" Separately, speaking at the Treasury Select Committee on Wednesday Deutsche Bank's chief UK economist Sanjay Raja said the mini-budget on 23 September was the ""straw that broke the camel's back"". He said the ""trade shock"" because of Brexit is a factor, and added: ""You throw on the 23 September event, you've got a side-lined financial watchdog, you've got lack of a medium-term fiscal plan, one of the largest unfunded tax cuts we've seen since the early 1970s, it was kind of the straw that broke the camel's back."" The Resolution Foundation's Torsten Bell said it was clear the huge package of cuts, which was downgraded to £43bn after Mr Kwarteng's U-turn on the top rate of income tax, should not have happened in the current financial climate. He said the sacking of the Treasury's top civil servant Sir Tom Scholar and the lack of a report on the economic impact from independent forecaster the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) had contributed to investor unease. ""It was no surprise to any of us that this is where you end up"". ""This is what happens if you aren't paying attention,"" he said. ""It was always going to be hard but it was exactly because it was always going to be hard that you don't do this."" The latest official statistics showed the economy unexpectedly shrank in August, strengthening predictions that it will fall into a recession. Professor Jagjit Chadha, director of National Institute of Economic and Social Research (Niesr) told the Commons Treasury Committee that the ""real danger"" seen after the mini-budget was ""obviously on the back of what can only be described as guerrilla tactics against our independent economic institutions over the summer - the Treasury, the Bank of England and the Office for Budget Responsibility"".  Gerard Lyons, an economist who advised Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng during the leadership contest, speaking on the BBC's World at One programme admitted that the mini-budget ""misread"" the country's financial situation.  However, he argued that everything that has happened was not ""solely due to the mini-budget"" but also down to parts of the financial system that were vulnerable to interest rates going up.  The Bank of England has warned interest rates could rise again after the value of the pound plummeted, following the government's decision to cut taxes and borrow more.  After the market turmoil, it stepped in with an emergency bond-buying intervention designed to stabilise the economy but said this scheme would end on Friday. Deputy Governor Ramsden said he was ""acutely"" aware that millions of households and businesses were experiencing ""real hardship"", noting that ""many"" of the policy actions were ""adding to the difficulties caused by the current situation"".   Prime Minister Liz Truss has said the promised tax cuts will boost UK economic growth and therefore help pay for themselves. The chancellor has committed to fast tracking the independent forecast by the OBR, the independent budget watchdog, at the same time as his economic plan detailing how he will pay for the planned tax cuts - which is now due to be announced on 31 October."
Bond Market Volatility,Will the UK financial chaos spark a wider meltdown?,2024-09-14,2022-10-14,By Natalie Sherman,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63221410,"The recent chaos on the UK financial markets has generated waves of stress and selling by investors far beyond the UK. As the sell-offs collide with high inflation, rising interest rates and the war in Ukraine, they have raised fears the turmoil in the UK could set off a wider crisis. Many analysts have said they believe the fallout is likely to be limited, especially amid signs that the government is reconsidering some of its plans. Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng was sacked on Friday, and the government has dropped parts of the package of tax cuts that initially sparked the market turmoil. But the episode has highlighted the financial risks of the current moment. ""Markets are fragile. We have seen vulnerability that's been building over the last decade-plus,"" Fabio Natalucci, a deputy director at the International Monetary Fund (IMF), said earlier this week, describing the UK episode as a ""warning shot"".  ""That fragility makes the financial risk much more elevated.""  Borrowing costs in the UK shot up last month, triggered by Mr Kwarteng's announcement of £45bn of tax cuts in his mini-budget, which the government said would help reignite economic growth.  But he did not say how he would pay for them, which alarmed investors already worried about the UK's dim economic prospects. They swiftly sold off their holdings of UK government debt, also called bonds or gilts. The sell-off in UK government bonds prompted a dramatic change in their value.  Prices dropped and investors demanded a higher interest rate for holding a riskier investment, creating major volatility in what is usually considered a stable, safe investment.  That kind of swing can have big ripple effects, as investment firms adjust their holdings to cover losses and the increased risk. In the UK, some of the first cracks appeared at pension funds, giant investment firms that manage people's retirement savings and typically put a big chunk towards investments like government debt. Facing losses that were at risk of spiralling, pension funds pleaded for help from the Bank of England, which agreed to step in and buy government debt as an emergency intervention. In fact, the Bank of England ended up stepping in three times. The sudden rise in borrowing costs also meant chaos for the UK housing market, where mortgage rates on typical two and five-year fixed deals have jumped to more than 6% for the first time in over a decade. Analysts expect the rise in mortgage rates to spark a fall in property prices, meaning that another investment often seen as pretty safe is suffering a major, rapid change in value.   Interest rates on some US and European government debt have also jumped alongside the UK's. And as UK firms respond to the changing market, they have dumped some of their riskier assets, creating knock-on effects. For example, selling of collateralised loan obligations (CLOs), a term for bundles of corporate debt, jumped in the weeks after the UK announcement, the Wall Street Journal reported. That is a part of the market that some already saw as full of financial risks.   ""There is a general sense of unease in financial markets because we never know where the landmines are buried,"" said economist Barry Eichengreen, professor at the University of California, Berkeley.   ""People are worried about which insurance companies and which pension funds and which bond markets are in a delicate state at the moment and we never know for sure. ""When bad things happen anywhere, people pause and global risk aversion rises."" IMF officials said last week that global financial instability was now verging on crisis levels, as investors pull back. ""We are certainly at a stressed moment,"" said Tobias Adrian, financial counsellor at the IMF warned, noting that indicators of strain, like demand for dollars, have surged. ""The only times when things were worse was in times of acute crisis."" The organisation did not forecast a major financial blow-up, noting that the traditional banking system in major economies like the US and UK has become more resilient in response to regulations imposed after the 2008 financial crisis. But there are more vulnerabilities in emerging markets, where the Fund estimates that 29% of banks are at risk of financial problems in the event of a sudden, serious downturn. In the US and UK, officials are also worried about unknown problems in the large ""shadow banking"" system - where investors develop and trade debt products largely outside the view of regulators. As central banks around the world raise interest rates, those piles of debt may come under strain. ""When we look at the safety and soundness of the financial system... we should look at not only the banks but also the non-bank lenders,"" Ben Bernanke, who led the US central bank during the 2008 financial crisis, warned on Monday. He was speaking at a press conference that was supposed to be about his winning the Nobel prize in economics, but was dominated by questions about the current economic risks. For now, the turmoil stemming from the UK appears to be a ""bump in the road,"" Jamie Dimon, head of US bank colossus JP Morgan said Friday.  But he warned: ""There are going to be other surprises""."
Bond Market Volatility,Moscow stock market reopens for limited trading,2024-09-14,2022-03-21,By Jennifer Meierhans,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60821258,"The Moscow stock exchange has partially reopened after a nearly month-long suspension over the war in Ukraine. Only bonds issued by the Russian government can be traded as part of a phased re-opening of the market.  The exchange closed hours after Russian President Vladimir Putin sent thousands of troops into Ukraine on 24 February. Andrei Braginsky, a spokesman for the Moscow Exchange, said he hoped that trading in stocks would be able to start again soon. ""Technically everything is ready, and we are hoping this will resume in the near future,"" he said.  The market reopened at 13:00 (10:00 GMT) but only for OFZ bonds - the Russian acronym for Federal Loan Obligations. In pre-market trading, yields on those government bonds rose by almost 20% - the highest on record. A higher yield means the government will have to pay more to borrow and indicates the investment is more risky. The yield later settled close to 13% after trading began. Central Bank governor Elvira Nabiullina said on Friday the bank would maintain its key interest rate at 20% and would purchase government bonds to limit volatility. Meanwhile, oil prices jumped more than $3 on Monday, with Brent crude climbing above $111 a barrel. Prices moved higher after reports that the EU was considering whether to join the US in imposing an oil embargo on Russia. The European Commission said earlier this month it aimed to make Europe independent from Russian fossil fuels ""well before 2030"". The invasion of Ukraine, and sanctions imposed by western governments, are taking a toll on the Russian economy. The Russian rouble was steady against the dollar on Monday, trading at 104.83 RUB. However, it is down by about a quarter since the start of the invasion. Some supermarkets are rationing sales of basic goods such as salt and cooking oil. The central bank more than doubled interest rates to 20% four days after the start of Moscow's military action in Ukraine. The continuation of the conflict and ratcheting up of sanctions have undermined confidence further. There have been concerns about Russia defaulting on its debt, but it paid $117 million in interest on two dollar-denominated bonds last week."
Bond Market Volatility,"Why are ships taking 6,500km detours?",2024-09-14,2016-03-04,Chris Baraniuk,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20160303-cheap-oil-is-taking-shipping-routes-back-to-the-1800s,"The plummeting price of oil on international markets has had many effects – one of which is that it may be cheaper for ships to travel right around Africa than go through the Suez Canal. The Suez Canal was one of the most significant engineering projects of the 19th Century. It was a gargantuan task that took nearly 20 years to build and an estimated 1.5 million workers took part – with many thousands dying in the process. But when it finally opened in 1869, ships could travel from the Red Sea – between Africa and Asia – to the Mediterranean, cutting weeks off a journey. It was a revolution for trade. Ever since, passage through the canal has been considered more or less vital to global business. Shipping firms pay what amounts to several billion dollars every year to the Suez Canal Authority, an Egyptian state-owned entity, for the privilege of travelling via the canal. To take an example, it cuts a modern journey from Singapore to Rotterdam in the Netherlands by nearly 3,500 nautical miles (6,480km) – saving vessel owners lots of time and lots of money. However, more and more some ships are deciding not to take the Suez route. Instead, they are travelling around the Cape of Good Hope, right at the southern tip of Africa. Over 100 ships did this between late October 2015 and the end of the year. “I’ve been covering shipping for the last eight years,” says Michelle Wiese Bockmann, from oil industry analysis firm OPIS Tanker Tracker. “It is very rare to see this volume going round the Cape.” Right now, she’s keeping tabs on half a dozen diesel and jet fuel-carrying ships on this very route. One of the big factors here, explains Bockmann, is the low price of oil. This means that “bunker fuel” – the thick, heavy fuel the ships themselves run on – is currently very cheap. Indeed, Singapore prices for such fuel have fallen from around $400 (£286) per metric ton in May 2015 to around $150 (£107) today. As a result, sea journeys aren’t as costly as they have been in recent years. But is there any sense in taking longer than you need to? Ship manufacturer Maersk estimates that a vessel travelling at 13.5 knots will take an extra 11 days to go via the Cape. Why bother? For one thing, there are steep fees for using the Suez Canal – Maersk says these can be approximately $350,000 (£249,000) per ship. There are other costs, too. Rose George, author of Deep Sea and Foreign Going, was on board a ship using the Canal a few years ago. She notes that vessels must agree to taking on a Suez crew for the transit. “[The Suez crew] seem to do nothing but listen to tinny radio and try to sell souvenirs,” says George, adding the ships often have to pay a cigarette ‘tax’. “On each voyage, Suez costs a ship about £400 ($560) of cigarettes, as well as dozens of chocolate bars from the bond locker.” These irritations aside, there is also the tricky economics of oil and shipping markets. For one thing, at the moment traders are playing with what’s called a “contango” – more and more oil and refined oil products are being kept at sea or in storage as traders wait for prices to rise again. Currently there is an oversupply of crude oil around the world, and while we have more crude than we need, the demand for gasoline – a refined oil product – is quite high. This situation has led to volatility in the market and that’s where traders are making their money, says Bockmann. “One of the trading strategies would be that they haven’t sold the cargo and they need additional time,” she points out. She also adds that ships can sometimes be anchored offshore – a situation known as “floating storage” where they simply wait for the market to favour what they have on board. “Floating storage hit a five-year record in December and it hasn’t really dropped that much since then,” Bockmann says. For ship owners, then, the ball seems to be mostly in their court. They can choose to be at sea longer in certain cases and they can take longer routes, even shopping unsold cargo round various ports in Asia, Africa and Europe, in an attempt to find the right buyer at the right time. The ships must be the right size for a given port, and the products on board need to meet required standards in the local market – but as long as someone suitable does, eventually, buy that cargo at a favourable price, then the traders will do well. If not, they could lose money. For now some ships have decided to take those additional thousands of miles round the Cape, hoping that at the end of the voyage they’ll come out in profit. It may seem strange – but in the world of oil, sometimes you’re better off taking the long way round.

Bond Market Volatility,Asia markets drop sharply after US falls,2024-09-14,2018-02-09,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42998819,"Major Asian markets suffered sharp losses on Friday, following another day of steep falls on Wall Street. In a volatile week for global investors, Japan's Nikkei 225 index slid 2.3%, while China's Shanghai Composite slumped by 4.1%.  Earlier, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by more than 1,000 points for the second time this week. Sell-offs around the world have been pinned partly on concerns over higher interest rates. Elsewhere in Asia on Friday, Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 3.1%, while South Korea's Kospi index traded down 1.8% and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 eased 0.9%. Those losses came as little surprise, with moves in major US markets providing the cue for global investors.  On Thursday, the Dow Jones ended 4.2% lower at 23,860, the S&P 500 closed down 3.8%, while the Nasdaq sank 3.9%. European exchanges also headed south on Thursday.  China was the worst performer in Asia on Friday as losses deepened from declines seen earlier this week.  Chinese stock markets tend to be volatile and are dominated by retail investors, rather than big institutions like many other major markets.  But falls in China can spark nervousness around the world over sentiment in the world's second largest economy.  As well as the broader sell-off, analysts said stocks in China were weighed down by people selling ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday. This is a common trend as the need for cash grows during this period - a time when Chinese companies typically pay bonuses and people also traditionally exchange cash and gifts during the period. This global sell-off began last week after a solid US jobs report fuelled expectations that the Federal Reserve would need to raise interest rates faster than expected because of the strength of the economy. That concern has prompted the pull-back from stocks.  On Thursday, the Bank of England seemed to offer support for the view that rates are on the up. The Bank left interest rates at 0.5% at its meeting, but said a strengthening economy meant interest rates were likely to rise sooner than the markets were expecting. Also worrying investors was a government budget proposal announced by US lawmakers, which raises spending caps and could fan inflation.  Bond yields in the US have also risen in recent weeks, typically a signal of higher rates. Higher interest rates push up borrowing costs for companies and individuals, which can hurt corporate profits and curb economic activity. At the same time, higher interest rates can make investment alternatives to stocks, such as bonds, more attractive. The uptick in volatility comes as investors react to the shifting conditions. And more turbulence could be on the way.  ""The return of volatility after two relatively calm days supports the idea there are further losses to come in the days and weeks ahead,"" said CMC Markets analyst Michael McCarthy.  The chaotic week on global markets also comes as several markets around the world sit on, or near record highs.  Analysts have said for months that financial markets were due a correction, after a long period of rising prices. Thursday's declines mean the Dow and S&P 500 have now fallen by more than 10% from the record highs set in January, a threshold analysts call a correction. Fidelity International's chief investment officer for Japan, Takashi Maruyama, said the ""massive volatility"" was a reaction to the rapid rise on the Japanese market since last year.  He added the sell-off presented a opportunity to buy shares at more ""reasonable"" prices. "
Bond Market Volatility,Performance anxiety,2024-09-14,2013-11-12,Ari Weinberg,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20131111-performance-anxiety,"“How am I doing?” That question was famously asked by 1980s New York City Mayor Ed Koch, but it’s likely one that you might — and should — ask yourself concerning your finances. To gauge the performance of your stocks, bonds or mutual funds, you might check major stock indexes daily. Or perhaps you’ll turn to your smartphone for the latest moves in the bond market. But that can steer you wrong when it comes to saving for the future. Why? Everyone has their own personal savings goals, their own financial challenges, and their own financial needs.   All that really matters? The Benchmark of You. That benchmark lies somewhere in the intersection between your savings objectives (retirement, education, a new car), the performance of widely-accepted benchmarks (the US Standard & Poor’s 500 index, the DAX, the price of gold and more) and your investments. While it can be challenging to define your personal sweet spot in the middle of these priorities, it is a valuable exercise.  Understanding the Benchmark of You, or your blended benchmark, if you prefer, can relieve you of some of the daily angst of watching the market. It can also steer you to smarter investments and less short-term thinking. Whether you actually build the Benchmark of You or just use this exercise as a way to see your investments — and your risks — in a new light, the process should help you focus on an understanding of your personal financial goals.  First steps To get started, first focus on your asset allocation, and how different mixes of stocks and bonds influence future potential returns and current income, said Fran Kinniry, an investment strategist for the Vanguard Group. This is important for gauging the risk of your investments. For example, stocks pay dividends but can also be very volatile. They increase/decrease based on the market’s view of future earnings. Bonds pay interest and return principal, but with some exceptions, are not particularly effective in times of inflation. Precious metals just sit there. In most cases, if you hold broadly diversified portfolios and don't try to time the market by trading, your risk and return will depend almost entirely on your asset mix and costs. “Once you’ve identified your asset allocation, then work down to make sure the benchmarks make sense: domestic stocks, foreign stocks, taxable bonds…etc,” said Kinniry.  If 10% of your portfolio is invested in US small cap stocks, then you should identify an appropriate benchmark index — such as the Russell 2000 — and make note of how that index does on a daily basis.   Two notes of caution before starting this exercise: The more individual stocks, bonds and funds you throw into the mix, the more benchmarks you may have to track. Also, remember to account for fees.  They vary, depending upon the investment, and can diminish your overall performance.  Here’s how you might go about pairing your investments with the appropriate benchmarks on the way to the Benchmark of You. 1. Start with your stocks and bonds: Identify the industry or sector in which the security would be grouped.  Then, you need to locate an index (or low-cost index fund) that closely corresponds with that security. Be careful, some companies may be hard to categorize. In some taxonomies, internet retailer Amazon.com is considered a “Services” business in the “Catalog & Mail Order Houses” industry. Apple is a “Consumer Goods” business in the “Electronic Equipment” industry. In the end, you are trying to match up your individual holdings with indexes that represent the industry the company is in. 2. Then move to your mutual funds:  You want to find which benchmark by which that fund is measured. (Most openly disclose this in the prospectus. Read it.) At the same time, make sure you understand the strategy of the fund. If it is an index fund, what is it trying to do? Is it tracking a traditional market-cap weighted index, which holds each company in an index according to its market weighting like the S&P 500, or is it trying to make a risk-return trade-off with different weightings and different sector exposures? All funds, index or not, disclose their objectives and what index or composite they are attempting to match or outperform. Data providers like Morningstar and Lipper can also provide some context by placing a fund in a peer group and comparing it against an index.   Some funds have split personalities. An “unconstrained bond fund” invests in anything with a coupon payment. A balanced fund may be 60% stocks and 40% bonds. There are dozens of flavours of hedge funds. Once you know what index your fund is trying to beat or match, track that alongside the fund quarterly and annually. 3. Pulling it all together: Once you’ve matched up all of your measurable investments to indexes or index funds, you can do one of two things. The simple solution is to track the total return of the indexes (or index funds) against your own holdings on a one-to-one basis. Size up the discrepancies quarterly or annually, whenever you rebalance your portfolio. The more complicated solution is to use an online portfolio tool at Yahoo Finance or Morningstar and create a “dummy portfolio” invested in index funds in proportion to your own stocks, bonds and funds. It gets even trickier when you want to rebalance or reinvest dividends. Unless you really want to manage your “dummy portfolio,” stick with option 1. Vanguard’s Kinniry cautions, however, that a blended benchmark can be distracting and lead to performance chasing. “If there’s a lot of volatility to your performance, overall and above or below the benchmark for each investment, then either you are looking at the wrong benchmarks or you are taking more risk than you expected,” said Kinniry. And for those who are still out there gunning to beat a benchmark, just bear in mind that a majority of investment funds can't consistently beat their own benchmarks."
Bond Market Volatility,"Why are ships taking 6,500km detours?",2024-09-14,2016-03-04,Chris Baraniuk,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20160303-cheap-oil-is-taking-shipping-routes-back-to-the-1800s,"The plummeting price of oil on international markets has had many effects – one of which is that it may be cheaper for ships to travel right around Africa than go through the Suez Canal.
