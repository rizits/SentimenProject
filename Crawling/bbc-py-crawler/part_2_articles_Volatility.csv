Volatility,How much will AI help in the next pandemic?,2024-09-25,2024-09-12,Suzanne Bearne,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1epnnd3l5jo,"It's been dubbed ""Disease X""  - the next global pandemic, which some experts predict is pretty much bound to happen.    Over the next decade, according to certain forecasts, there's a one in four chance of another outbreak on the scale of Covid-19.  It could be influenza or coronavirus - or something completely new. Covid-19, of course, infected and killed millions of people worldwide, so it's a frightening prospect. So could AI help to alleviate it? Researchers in California are developing an AI-based early warning system that will examine social media posts to help predict future pandemics.  The researchers, from University of California, Irvine (UCI) and the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), are part of the US National Science Foundation's Predictive Intelligence for Pandemic Prevention grant programme. This funds research that “aims to identify, model, predict, track and mitigate the effects of future pandemics”. The project builds on earlier work by UCI and UCLA researchers, including a searchable database of 2.3 billion US Twitter posts collected since 2015, to monitor public health trends. Prof Chen Li is is co-leading the project at UCI's Department of Computer Science, alongside Dr Wei Wang at UCLA's Samueli School of Engineering. Prof Li says they have been collecting billions of tweets on X, formerly known as Twitter, over the past few years.  The tool works by figuring out which tweets are meaningful and training the algorithm to help to detect early signs of a future pandemic, predict upcoming outbreaks, and evaluate the potential outcomes of specific public health policies, says Prof Li. “We have developed a machine-learning model for identifying and categorising significant events that may be indicative of an upcoming epidemic from social media streams."" The tool, which is targeted at public health departments and hospitals, can also ""evaluate the effects of treatments to the spread of viruses"", he says.   However, it’s not without problems. For example, it is reliant on X, a platform not accessible in some countries.  “The availability of data outside the US has been mixed,” admits Prof Li. “So far our focus has been within the US. We are working to overcome the data scarcity and potential bias when we expand the coverage to other regions of the world.” Developed by Harvard Medical School and the University of Oxford, an AI tool called EVEScape is making predictions about new variants of coronavirus. Researchers are publishing a ranking of new variants every two weeks, and they claim that the tool has also made accurate predictions about other viruses, including HIV and influenza. “One of the unique strengths of our approach is that it can be used early in a pandemic,” says Nikki Thadani, a former postdoctoral research fellow who was involved in the development of EVEScape. “It could be good for... vaccine manufacturers, and also for people trying to identify therapeutics, particularly antibodies to get some insight early on into which mutations might arise even a year in the future.” It's a point picked up by AstraZeneca's vice president of data science and AI R&D, Jim Wetherall. The pharmaceutical giant uses AI to help speed up the discovery of new antibodies. Antibodies are proteins used by the body's immune system to fight off harmful substances. They can be used to make new vaccines. Mr Wetherall says the firm can ""generate and screen a library of antibodies and bring the highest quality predictions to the lab, reducing the number of antibodies that need to be tested, and cutting the time to identify target antibody leads from three months to three days"".   This is helpful for pandemic preparedness, he says, ""because as we have seen with Covid-19, the potential volatility of viruses means that we need quicker ways to identify candidates to keep up with rapidly mutating targets."" The Oslo-headquartered Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) - which funded EVEScape - views AI as a tool to help in its goal of preparing for and responding to epidemics and pandemics. “We just have to be as broadly well prepared as possible,” says Dr In-Kyu Yoon, director, programmes and innovative technology at CEPI.  “And what AI does is it speeds up that that preparation process.”  However, he says AI still needs to develop and mature. “AI still depends on the information that is inputted, and I don't think anybody would say that we actually have all the information.  ""Even if the AI then can try to evaluate, analyse it and predict from that, it's based on information that's put in. AI is a tool and the tool can be applied to various activities that can increase the quality and speed of the preparation for the next pandemic.  ""[But] it would probably be wrong to say that AI can slow down or prevent the next pandemic. It's up to people to determine where to apply it.” At the World Health Organization (WHO), Dr Philip AbdelMalik also highlights the role people play in AI's efficacy.  As the WHO's unit head of intelligence, innovation and integration, he says AI has definite value. It can pick up on chatter around particular symptoms, for example, and spot potential threats before governments have officially announced  them. Also, it can pick up if people are advocating potentially dangerous treatments online so the WHO can step in.  However, while he can see its benefits, he is quick to flag up the challenges.  He says he’s always careful to say AI is not going to generate decisions for us. Plus, Dr AbdelMalik is concerned about the issues surrounding ethical use of AI and equitable representation. “If I'm feeding it a lot of information that I'm not reviewing, and so it contains a lot of misinformation, or it's representative only of certain subpopulations, then what I'm going to get out is also going to be representative of just some subpopulations or contain a lot of misinformation.  ""So it's that old adage of, you know, garbage in, garbage out.” But overall, experts believe we’re in a better position for the next pandemic, partly because of the progress made in AI. “I think this pandemic was kind of a wake-up call to a lot of people who think about this space,” says Nikki Thadani.   “Our model [AI tool EVEScape], and a lot of other efforts to really refine how we think about epidemiology, and how we think about leveraging the sort of data that you can have before a pandemic, and then integrating it with the data that's coming in through a pandemic, that does make me feel better about our ability to handle pandemics in the future.”  But, she says, there's a long way to go both on more of the fundamental biology and modelling she has worked in, but in epidemiology and public health more broadly, to help make us more prepared for future pandemics. “We're much better off now than we were three years ago,” says Dr AbdelMalik.  ""However, there’s something more important than technology to help us when the next pandemic hits, and that’s trust. “Technology to me is not our limiting factor. I think we really have to work on relationships, on information sharing and building trust. We keep saying that, everybody's saying that, but are we actually doing it?"""
Volatility,'Starmer faces winter fuel anger' as 'scores of MPs could rebel',2024-09-25,2024-09-08,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn7l3r3lz1go," The row about the government's decision to scrap the winter fuel allowance dominates the front pages.  Looking ahead to Tuesday's Commons vote, the Guardian says ""up to 50"" Labour MPs could refuse to back the plans.  Sources tell the paper that ""dozens"" could abstain or be absent, but few on the government benches are expected to actually vote against the policy.  ""Abstention is the new rebellion"" says one anonymous Labour MP. Describing the vote as ""a key test"" of Sir Keir Starmer's authority, the Times says a ""bullish"" prime minister is ""shrugging off"" any criticism.  Government sources tell the paper they are not concerned about the size of any potential rebellion.  But it also reports that the Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall spent the weekend on the phone, ringing round ""wavering backbenchers."" The Daily Mail asks why Labour is pushing ahead with the policy when it claimed that the party's own research back in 2017 warned that cutting the payments could lead to the deaths of thousands of pensioners.  The paper says the ""shocking analysis"" was written after Theresa May's Conservative government announced similar plans to scrap the allowance and describes the proposal, which was later dropped by the Tories, as the ""single biggest attack on pensioners in a generation"".  The Mail points out that Sir Keir was in the shadow cabinet when the research was first published. ""Don't be a fuel, Keir"" says the Daily Mirror's editorial. The paper describes the policy as a ""political mistake"" which ""surely merits a rethink.""  It's urged the government to come up with an ""escape route"" before tomorrow's vote. The i newspaper says the government could respond to the criticism by announcing plans in next month's Budget for a social tariff for energy bills - similar to those for mobile phones.  The paper says government officials are weighing up the idea, which would give households on lower incomes cheaper gas and electricity. The Daily Telegraph leads on the findings of a major report on the state of the NHS, due to be published later this week, which will warn that the health service is ""going backwards"" for the first time in 50 years.  The government-commissioned report, by the surgeon and former health minister, Lord Darzi, will say that progress made since the 1970s on deaths from heart disease is now ""in reverse"". The Times reports that the law enforcement agency at the forefront of the government's plans to tackle trafficking gangs is ""in crisis"" and is losing more officers than it recruits.  The paper says a new report on the performance of the National Crime Agency (NCA) concludes that it is ""on its knees"" due to a lack of funding. The Home Office says it is committed to investing in the NCA. And according to the Telegraph, ""lazy joggers"" are paying ""mules"" to run for them so they do not lose ""kudos"" on the popular fitness app Strava.  Used by runners, cyclists and swimmers, the app tracks routes and times, allowing amateur athletes to share their progress on social media.  But the paper says it has uncovered a new trend where users offer to take on someone else's exercise so they can still boast about how fit they are, even when they are too busy or lazy to do it themselves. Strava says any accounts found violating the apps terms of service will be suspended. Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox."
Volatility,£71m school campus project to face 'major delays',2024-09-25,2024-08-21,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gdlkvzg2yo,"A new school campus in Peterhead is facing major delays after the preferred contractor pulled out.  Aberdeenshire Council said it is still committed to the £71m project but does not expect it to be finished until at least early 2028.  The authority had been hoping to open the campus, which will replace the town's academy, two primaries and a special education school, in 2026. Robertson Construction said it is withdrawing following a lengthy review of the expected outcomes of the project. The council added the new school was already experiencing delays due to issues in the supply chain and market volatility.  It will now work with the construction sector on the best way to proceed, likely costs and timescales. Peterhead Academy Parents Council said parents are ""losing confidence"" that their children will ever get the chance to learn in modern facilities. David Wilson, chairman of the group said: ""Parents, pupils and staff are having to make do with an ageing building. The children of Peterhead deserve access to safe and suitable facilities.  ""Unfortunately the plans the council have are not turning into action. Sadly it is something that remains in the far future rather than something we will see soon."""
Volatility,Energy prices forecast to rise by 9% in October,2024-09-25,2024-08-19,Kevin Peachey,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy54r9r1355o,"Domestic energy prices are expected to rise in the run-up to winter, according to consultancy Cornwall Insight. The forecaster, which is widely regarded for its accurate predictions, said a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity would pay £1,714 a year from October. That would be a £146 a year rise compared with a current typical annual bill - the lowest for two years - of £1,568. Energy regulator Ofgem will announce the next official quarterly price cap on Friday, with charities concerned about the prospect of prices rising again. Although the price cap is changed every three months, it is illustrated by Ofgem in terms of an annual bill for a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity. People in larger properties will tend to pay more overall owing to higher energy usage, and those in smaller properties will pay less. That is because the cap limits the maximum price that can be charged for each unit of gas and electricity, rather than the total bill.  It affects 28 million households in England, Wales and Scotland. The sector is regulated separately in Northern Ireland.  Cornwall Insight said prices paid by households, although protected to some degree by the price cap, were affected by volatility in the fragile global energy market. Wholesale costs, paid by suppliers, had risen by about 20% in the last few months, it said. These are reflected in consumer bills, accounting for about half of what customers pay.  With prices set to rise, some billpayers might look at the options available to fix their energy tariff. Cornwall Insight said that the average saving from the top 10 cheapest tariffs on the market in August was only £5 a year, compared with a default tariff set by the price cap.  That may change in the coming weeks, and Richard Neudegg, from price comparison website Uswitch, said there were options for those who wanted certainty. ""Just because it is a fix, it doesn't mean it is a good price fix,"" he said. ""The question for consumers is, if they want that level of certainty, how cheaply can they get it.""  Cornwall Insight also said it expected costs to rise again during the winter, when the January price cap is announced.   It said a ""modest"" rise was anticipated. However, recent tensions in the Russia-Ukraine war could see prices rise further, it added. ""While we don't expect a return to the extreme prices of recent years, it's unlikely that bills will return to what was once considered normal. Without significant intervention, this may well be the new normal,"" said Craig Lowrey, principal consultant at the forecaster. Charity National Energy Action said any increases in prices, alongside less support from the government, could stretch some households' finances ""beyond breaking point"". Standing charges, a fixed daily fee covering the costs of connecting to a supply, currently stand at at 60p a day for electricity and 31p a day for gas, although they vary by region. Ofgem is currently considering whether to change the standing charge billing system. Energy bills are considerably lower than the peak after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, when the government stepped in to limit bill rises, but are much higher than before the pandemic. Experts have shared three tips to keep on top of energy use during the warmer months: Read more here if you are struggling to pay energy bills"
Volatility,Global stocks climb as US recession fears ease,2024-09-25,2024-08-09,Michael Race & João da Silva,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8dpm9n2g6go,"The stock index of the UK's biggest publicly-listed companies edged higher on Friday after concerns eased over the state of the US economy.  The FTSE 100, which is made up of the country's biggest businesses including banks, airlines and housebuilders, rose in early trading. It follows stronger trading in the US where stock markets had their best day in almost two years on Thursday. Global financial markets have been spooked in the past seven days over fears that world's biggest economy could be heading for a slowdown. But on Thursday, official data revealed US unemployment claims rose by less than expected. The benchmark S&P 500 index ended the day 2.3% higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.8%, and the Nasdaq jumped 2.9%. In London, the FTSE 100 ticked up 0.7%. Stock markets indexes in Paris and Frankfurt followed a similar path. Stocks in Asia made modest gains, recovering some of the losses after Japanese indexes had their worst day since 1987 earlier in the week. ""The [US] latest jobless claims data, though not normally a major market event, supports the view that recent pessimism may have been overdone,"" said UBS Global Wealth Management. Official figures from the US Labor Department showed first-time claims for unemployment benefits in the US had fallen more than expected to 233,000 last week. But despite the apparent recovery in global markets, analysts warn that trading will likely remain choppy for the time being. ""The market volatility is creating trading opportunities for investors over the short term,"" said Peter McGuire from trading platform XM.com. ""It will be a bumpy ride over the election season and we all await the [US Federal Reserve] policy decision in September."" The Federal Reserve held off cutting interest rates last week - something that typically boosts growth - in contrast to other central banks such as the Bank of England. But, this week's market upheaval stoked further speculation about when - and by how much - the Fed will cut borrowing costs. ""[The] Fed is now likely to cut rates up to 50bps in September which in turn supports expanding valuation for the market,"" said Jun Bei Liu, portfolio manager at Tribeca Investment Partners."
Volatility,US stock markets rise after days of turmoil,2024-09-25,2024-08-06,Dearbail Jordan and João da Silva,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1d77xe2p26o,"US shares opened higher on Tuesday as an uneasy calm returned to global markets after days of sharp falls.  The technology-heavy Nasdaq, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 all closed higher.  It followed subdued trading in the UK and Europe with London's FTSE 100 initially rising before falling back.  In Japan, the Nikkei 225 stock index jumped by 10.2%, or 3,217 points in its biggest one-day gain in points, after the previous day's plummet. The stock market rout began on Friday following disappointing US employment figures for July which showed that the jobless rate rose, sparking fears of a recession.   There has also been concern that shares in big technology companies - particularly those investing heavily in artificial intelligence (AI) - have been overvalued and some of those firms now face difficulties.  The volatility intensified on Monday, spreading to Europe and Asia where Japan's Nikkei 225 slumped by 12%.  But by the end of Tuesday the global picture looked more positive:  ""Markets were hit by a perfect storm over the weekend, with numerous factors combining to spook investors,"" said Rachel Winter, partner at investors Killik & Co.  She added that nerves about the US election had also contributed to the volatility, as ""markets detest uncertainty"". Economists are divided over the outlook for the US economy, with a number cautioning that it is premature to suggest the world's largest economy is heading for a downturn. If it does, however, it would have wider implications.  ""What happens in the US economically and financially does not stay in the US,"" said economist Mohamed El-Erian, who is also president of Queens' College, Cambridge.  ""The US has been the major driver of global economic growth, the US consumer is a very important engine of economic activity so the world as a whole would suffer if the US were to go into recession."" Fears of recession have renewed calls for the US Federal Reserve to cut interest rates at its next meeting in September in a bid to boost growth. Last week, the Fed voted to hold rates in the range of 5.25%-5.5% - the highest for two decades - while other central banks decided to cut them.  Some experts say that was a mistake and that stock markets are likely to remain unsettled as a result. “Markets are very volatile at the moment and will likely stay volatile until the Fed decision in September, so we wouldn't rule out rapid swings in both directions,” said Stefan Angrick, a senior economist with Moody's Analytics. The sharp fall in Japanese stocks on Monday was driven in part by issues facing the country's economy.  Japan's currency, the yen, has been strengthening against the US dollar since the Bank of Japan raised interest rates last week. It has made stocks in Tokyo - and Japanese goods in general - more expensive for foreign investors and buyers. At the same time inflation in Japan rose by more than expected in June while the economy shrank in the first three months of the year. Commenting on the country's outlook, Jesper Koll, executive director of Monex Group Japan, said he still had confidence in the country. ""Japan’s fundamentals are strong, recession risks are nil and corporate leaders are dead-set on raising capital returns,"" he told the BBC."
Volatility,Brain injury rehab could close over lack of clients,2024-09-25,2024-08-02,Pamela Tickell,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1vdvnvy9p2o,"A rehabilitation centre for people with brain injuries could close because of a lack of clients. The Lake District Calvert Trust, which runs the 10-bed Calvert Reconnections unit in Keswick, announced proposals to close the centre and said consultations with employees had opened. The charity said the centre had not been attracting enough clients on a consistent basis to make it financially sustainable, adding it had been ""severely impacted"" by the pandemic. Its two other centres, Calvert Lakes and Calvert Stables, which help people with disabilities take part in outdoor activities in the countryside, will continue to operate with some restructuring. The Calvert Reconnections centre is a specially adapted residential care centre for people with acquired brain injury and is staffed by a clinical therapy team. Chair of the Board of Trustees Martin Mullin said the proposals would help ensure the long-term sustainability of the charity. ""These changes are being proposed to ensure that the Lake District Calvert Trust operates for many years to come,"" he said. The charity said the planned opening and establishment of Calvert Reconnections in 2020 had been severely impacted by the pandemic.   Since it opened, the centre has suffered from volatility in numbers of participant bookings and, since March 2024, there has been a significant reduction in occupancy, the charity says. The charity added the trustees were confident the proposed new structure of the Lake District Calvert Trust would be ""financially sustainable"".

Volatility,Thousands head to farm for global Muslim convention,2024-09-25,2024-07-26,Marcus White,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3g9239y0j1o,"More than 35,000 people are expected to attend one of the largest spiritual conventions in the UK. The three-day Jalsa Salana, starting on Friday, is held annually on a farm near Alton, Hampshire, attracting members of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community from across the world. Organisers said this year's event would have a special emphasis on prayers and peace, urging Muslims to play their role in reducing global volatility and uncertainty. The event, which is broadcast worldwide, includes a seminar on news reporting of the war in Gaza, as well as spiritual ceremonies. Rafiq Hayat, UK President of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, said: ""Our convention is a reminder that our duty as Muslims is to be loyal, peaceful and dutiful citizens. ""Through our motto 'Love for All, Hatred for None' we aim to build stronger, more cohesive communities and promote peace and tolerance."" The Ahmadi movement has its origins in British-controlled northern India in the late 19th Century. Orthodox Muslims consider followers as heretical as they do not believe Mohammed was the final prophet sent to guide mankind. First held in 1964, Jalsa Salana UK moved to the site at East Worldham in 2006 after it was purchased by the community to accommodate more attendees. Organisers of this year's convention said they hoped to ease previous traffic congestion by opening a new entrance as well as providing shuttle buses.

Volatility,How Gen Z became so nihilistic about money,2024-09-25,2024-07-31,Lillian Stone,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20240731-how-gen-z-became-so-nihilistic-about-money,"The ""buy everything, own nothing"" generation has seen the cost of living soar. They're ""vibing"" their way into adulthood, and some experts say they've got it right. My younger sister, Sophie, isn't worried about retirement – but she's not exactly optimistic about it, either. ""We've got climate change, war – it's like, are we even going to be here to retire?"" she muses on a recent phone call, adding: ""I don't necessarily feel worried. It's more like helplessness."" At 23, Sophie falls firmly into Gen Z, the cohort born between 1997 and 2012. She suspects that her generation may never own homes, accumulate comfortable retirement savings or achieve other traditional financial milestones. She's not alone: Gen Z content creators are loudly airing their nihilism on TikTok and expressing frustration at what they call unattainable financial goals. But experts say the disgruntled TikToks don't tell the whole story. Ajla Brama, a 26-year-old content creator and social media consultant born in Albania, uses TikTok to unpack the financial pitfalls and ""scams"" facing Gen Z in the US, including falling wages and a challenging real estate market in which rent increases outpace earnings. ""We want to be able to afford a decent living, but we can't even move out of our parents' house,"" laments Brama in one video sparked by what she calls a ""lack of accountability"" on the part of employers. ""I get so tired of seeing content saying, 'Oh, if you just saved a little more, if you just invested a little more…' Like, no – people are on the edge. People cannot afford to live, to eat, to put gas in their cars,"" Brama says. That's partly why Brama now splits her time between the United States and Europe, where she feels the quality of life is better for young people with financial limitations. ""People in the US see countries [like Albania] where the salaries might be lower and think 'Oh, I'd never live there',"" she says. ""It's true that, in Albania, you might make a lot less, but you also probably won't have credit card debt or student debt, and you'll have healthcare. People [in Europe] are actually living life."" (The Global Liveability Index would agree.) Around the globe, the eldest Gen Z-ers are heading into their late-20s amid undeniable economic headwinds. Per the July 2024 World Economic Outlook update published by the International Monetary Fund, ""momentum on global disinflation is slowing"", marked by ongoing higher-than-average inflation in services prices, cross-border trade restrictions and central banks' reluctance to initiate rate cuts. With that in mind, financial negativity isn't just a Gen Z problem. Financial wellness company Brightplan's 2024 Wellness Barometer Survey of 1,400 US-based knowledge workers at global companies found that a majority, regardless of age, report feeling stressed about their financial situation, citing high inflation, rising interest rates and market volatility as complicating factors. Andrew Roth, 25, argues that Gen Z-ers aren't all doom and gloom around finance – they just approach traditional milestones a bit more sceptically. ""[For Gen Z], trust in institutions is at an all-time low,"" says Roth, the founder and CEO of dcdx, a Gen Z research and strategy firm. In the US, he says, young people feel ""their government hasn't earned their trust. Older generations haven't earned their trust, whether that's in regard to climate, gun reform, police reform – young people feel that they are not being listened to."" A 2023 survey from Gallup and the Walton Family Foundation backs that up, finding fewer than one in five people aged 18 to 26 reported having ""a great deal"" of trust in major US institutions, including the criminal justice system, the Supreme Court, the presidency, big tech companies and the news.  They may be skeptical of higher education, too. In the UK where one year of university costs £9,250 ($11,881), recent data has found the gap in earning potential between graduates and non-graduates shrinking, stress-testing the question of whether a degree is ""worth it"". In the US, tuition averages $19,068 (£14,844) per year – a cost that has more than doubled in the 21st Century – and recent PEW data found only 22% of U.S. adults report seeing the cost of college as worth it even when students need to take out loans. Only one-in-four said it’s extremely or very important to have a four-year college degree in order to get a well-paying job in today's economy. These feelings are born out in Gen Z enrollment rates. The percentage of US high school graduates enrolling in college has fallen from 70% in 2009, firmly in Millennial territory, to 62% in 2022, according to the National Center for Educational Statistics data cited by a BestColleges review of research.  Roth says the social media-driven ""gamification"" of personal finance – the rise of absurd meme stocks, for example – feeds into an apparent nihilistic approach to money. Take the ""girl math"" phenomenon of 2023 or Gen Z's unfortunate label as the ""buy everything, own nothing"" generation; in all cases, the message seems to be: money isn't real. ""With all the gamification, the true importance of personal finance gets lost,"" says Roth, hinting that the dissociative discourse around savings and success is a bit of a front. ""What some perceive as laziness or nihilism might actually be more of a paralysis because there are so many options,"" he says. The younger generation still wants to flourish, says Mark Beal, an assistant professor at the Rutgers University School of Communication and Information and the author of ZEO: Introducing Gen Z – The New Generation Of Leaders. ""Gen Z does have financial goals,"" notes Beal. ""They are earning money. They are saving money. They are investing money. Some have already purchased homes. They're just approaching [goals] differently. It's not quite as structured and rigid as previous generations – those of us who thought, 'By the time I'm 30, I need a house with a white picket fence'."" Just more than a quarter (26.3%) of adult members of Gen Z owned a home in 2023, according to a report from US real estate company Redfin. Meanwhile, a 2024 report from Britain's National Centre for Social Research found that 81% of Gen Z would buy a home if they could. Meanwhile, in a recent Consumer Pulse Survey of 3,000 adults representing the general population of the United States, TransUnion found that Gen Z ""appeared to be the most stable of any generation"" in the second quarter of 2024, with 65% of Gen Z respondents stating they feel optimistic about their ability to manage household expenses over the next year – compared to less than 50% of baby boomers and Gen X-ers. More like this: • What it's like to live in the world's most liveable cities for 2024 • Are Gen Z the most stressed generation in the workplace? • Not all employers are tolerating Gen Z's laid-back language Still, 57-year-old Beal notes that where his generation might have followed their parents' financial blueprint, the constant barrage of social media content shows Gen Z that there are other things to live for – other goals that might take priority over homeownership or beefing up one's retirement accounts. ""I'm a Gen X-er,"" says Beal. ""We lived to work. Generation Z works to live. They work to enjoy life, to experience life, to travel. They have a completely different mindset – which, as a Gen X-er, I think is the correct mindset. I think they are living a more well-balanced life."" The way Sophie puts it? Gen Z is ""vibing"". ""I'm just living life, but that's how everyone is,"" she tells me over the phone, noting that most of her friends are enjoying their early 20s without too much regard for the future. Honestly, it sounds familiar – when I was her age, I was scraping by in a cockroach-infested apartment. She adds: ""If financial stuff is brought up, we're all just like, 'Oh, yeah, maybe one day'."" --  If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. "
Volatility,Work to renovate city park rises by further £4.8m ,2024-09-25,2024-07-26,Charis Scott-Holm,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckkg5ygrdpro,"An extra £4.8m is needed to complete works to regenerate Queens Gardens in Hull. Funding of £12m was announced to make improvements at the city centre park in 2021 but the project is now expected to cost £21.1m in total. Hull City Council's cabinet approved the additional funds at a meeting on Monday. Councillor Mike Ross, the leader of the authority, said the plans were now ""significantly better and more ambitious"" than those put forward originally. Last year, it was decided that the project should be split into two phases to help ""address urgent structural issues and reduce the impact of ongoing uncertainty and volatility in the construction industry relating to Brexit and the Covid-19 pandemic"". Both phases cost more than the council first anticipated and interim costings last year put the project at £16.3m. The recommendations to increase the budget were made to cabinet, which supported the increase to ""enable improved delivery of the project"". Additional costs include more tree planting, rebuilding walls, drainage and hazard removal. The project is set to create a link between some of the city’s key maritime heritage sites. Mr Ross said: ""People said they wanted to see improvements to this area and the council is committed to delivering them. “These more ambitious plans, put together with cost inflation, Brexit, and the Covid-19 pandemic have naturally led to the increase in costs. “The works will ensure that this much-loved and cherished green space, in the heart of the city centre, is future-proofed for generations to come. “We are proud to preserve the history and heritage of our city and improve public spaces for the community. So far, the work on the project has been going to plan and the transformation in the gardens is already clear to see.” Follow BBC East Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.

Volatility,PM agrees with Army chief's warning of 'volatile' world,2024-09-25,2024-07-24,Becky Morton,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cervpedjejwo,"Sir Keir Starmer ""completely agrees"" with the thrust of a warning from the new head of the Army that Britain must be prepared for an ""increasingly volatile"" world, Downing Street has said.  In his first speech in the role on Tuesday, Gen Sir Roland Walker said the country must be ready to fight a war in three years. The prime minister's official spokesman said Sir Keir himself had talked about ""a new and dangerous era"", with threats from countries like Russia, North Korea and Iran.  It comes as the UK has signed a new defence agreement with Germany. Asked whether Sir Keir agreed with Gen Walker's comments, the PM's spokesman said he had spoken about the new era being ""defined by volatility and insecurity"".  ""That is exactly why the government's first and foremost committed to national security,"" he added.  The government has launched a review of the current state of the UK armed forces, the threats the country faces and the capabilities needed to address them.  Asked whether, if the country needed to be ready for war in three years, it was right to spend time on a review, the PM's spokesman said: ""The prime minister completely agrees with the thrust of the head of the Army.  ""He has talked previously about the new and dangerous era we live in and that is why we have launched the strategic defence review to assess those dangers, to assess those challenges, and ensure that we have got the capabilities we need to respond to those challenges as and when they arise."" In his speech at the Royal United Services Institute land warfare conference, Gen Walker, who took over as chief of the general staff last month, said war was not inevitable and the Army had ""just enough time"" to prepare itself to avoid conflict.  He said he aimed to double the Army's fighting power in three years and triple it by the end of the decade.  He vowed to increase the ""lethality"" of his force through modernisation and new technology, without the need for greater troop numbers.  The size of the UK's regular Army, excluding volunteers, has been falling in recent years.  Labour has said it is committed to increasing spending on defence to 2.5% of national income when economic conditions allow, with the defence review setting out a ""roadmap"" for doing this.  However, the Conservatives have criticised the government for not matching its election pledge to reach 2.5% by 2030.  It comes as Defence Secretary John Healey makes his first visit to Germany to sign a new defence declaration with the country.  He is also visiting France, Poland and Estonia this week, in what the government has described as a ""reset of relationships"" with the UK's European neighbours.  In the agreement, the UK and Germany have pledged to work more closely together to strengthen their defence industries, reinforce European security and support Ukraine.  Germany is the second biggest donor of military aid to Ukraine after the US, with the UK the third biggest donor. "
Volatility,Hunting the rave with the help of virtual reality,2024-09-25,2024-07-20,Caroline Gall,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80eyyd3852o,"In 1989, the Acid House rave scene was very much a covert, and often illegal, affair.  Before social media and mobile phones, picking up the scent for a secret warehouse event was tricky - but the dedicated ravers always got to the party. Now though, with the help of interactive, virtual reality (VR), you can re-live the trip back to that era, or immerse yourself in it for the first time. It is all down to Darren Emerson - creator of exhibition In Pursuit of Repetitive Beats - who says capturing the element of adventure was crucial. The exhibition has begun a tour across the UK, with Birmingham its first port of call. It takes visitors on a full rave journey - first, trying to find out where the party is while avoiding the police and then immersing yourself in the music. A VR headset guides you through various stages - the car journey, even a police station, while a vibrating haptic vest helps you feel the base in the warehouse, before you emerge into the morning sun after a night of dancing. ""This is also a lived experience for me,"" says Mr Emerson, namesake of the global DJ and ex-Underworld member. ""I wasn't around in 1989, but I did do this stuff in the mid-90s and you'll see that there's a red Peugeot in it - my mate used to have a red Peugeot and we'd travel round the country trying to find these raves and having this amazing time and I really wanted to represent the adventure element."" He said it was really important to base the exhibition around 1989, being the year old ravers tend to remember most. ""The fact they didn't know where they were going, they were out on a limb , they didn't have mobile phones, or GPS and it really was a cat and mouse game to try to get to this party,"" he sys. ""So, I thought that was a good premise for a VR experience but also a documentary experience - it's very much a documentary but it's a documentary that you're in."" He had considered basing it around the M25 area, but knew the same scene was bursting into life in the West Midlands. Working with Coventry City of Culture Trust in 2021-2 to first create the experience, organisers decided the region deserved a share of the nostalgic limelight. ""Coventry, the West Midlands - and we do focus on this in our exhibition - the Birmingham scene, really was at the forefront of this change and it's not often cited,"" he said. ""You will hear about Manchester and the Hacienda until the cows come home and London and the M25 and Sunrise and those Orbital raves and Blackburn getting attention and that's not to take away from any of those scenes. ""But, Coventry and Birmingham and the West Midlands as a whole needs to be in that conversation as well."" The Eclipse nightclub in Coventry was the first venue to have an all-night licence which pulled in ravers from around the country and the Amnesia House brand was also growing in the city and becoming a pioneer in ""putting on all-nighters"". ""These aren't local things, they are beacons that would attract people that were into this at the time,"" he added. ""You could very easily have a group of people leaving London and going up the M6 in search of this Amnesia House rave so for me, it had that sort of universal sense,"" he says.  ""It's really about that spirit of adventure, it's about being young and going on those seminal nights that really define who you are as you move from being a teenager, I guess, living in your parent's house to being an adult and who are the people who are going to shape who you're going to become and these are the nights that do that. ""So at the end of it when you come out into the sunrise, it's like a new dawn - that feeling of like 'I've just done something incredible and now I feel changed."" Choosing 1989 was also pertinent - the scene was in its infancy and innocent - while societal changes and political volatility was sweeping through the UK. It was the end of Thatcherism, there was high unemployment, industry had closed down somewhat - with car-making reduced in Coventry - and abandoned warehouses were being put to use by partygoers. ""People were reclaiming this, it's about people doing something for themselves and it feels to me like one of the last real youth revolutions in that sense culturally that changed everything,"" Mr Emerson says. ""Dance music is now ubiquitous, it's commercial, it's everywhere but it starts from this."" However, nowadays bigger clubs are closing down and society and the night-time economy has changed again, he said. But the experience has a lot to offer to people who weren't there at the time - it's not just for nostalgic ravers. ""We've had so many people coming out crying with joy and wanting to hug,"" he added. ""As a team, and we're not there all the time, but we've given out so many hugs to people who are like, 'Oh man, I just need a hug' because they feel so emotionally connected to it,"" says Mr Emerson. ""So there's a lot of nostalgia, there's a lot of things for people to learn who weren't there and we've had families who have brought their teenage kids and going, 'Look this is how we used to do it'."" The award-winning project (produced by East City Films) will visit eight cities across the UK with Waterhall at Birmingham Museum & Art Gallery, where it is now open until 1 September. Sara Wajid, joint CEO of Birmingham Museums Trust, said: ""I knew after trying the experience and the amount of joy I felt that we had to be a part of bringing this experience to the people of Birmingham and the West Midlands. “Bringing joy, music and history together in The Waterhall marks the next exciting step in re-opening Birmingham Museum & Art Gallery – the first spaces of which will open later this year.""

Volatility,Farmers 'cautiously hopeful' for new government,2024-09-25,2024-07-11,Emily Johnson,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ck5g45zl510o,"Farmers visiting the Great Yorkshire Show said they felt optimistic about the new government after enduring challenging times. Facing ""through the roof"" inflation, poor weather and changes in government policy, farmers said they ""desperately needed confidence"" in leadership. Newly appointed Environment Secretary Steve Reed said farming was an ""absolute priority"" for the government. He added that ""food security is national security"", which was a sentiment echoed by farmers. The event in Harrogate, which runs from Tuesday to Friday, has brought together people from across the agriculture industry. Members of the National Farmers' Union spoke to the BBC about what sort of changes they wanted to see in farming moving forward. Andrew Loftus, a beef farmer from Masham in North Yorkshire, said he was ""cautiously hopeful"" about the new Labour government. ""If they can support small farming businesses, have fairness in the supply chain, have a good balance between production and the environment, then yes, let's be optimistic,"" he said. Mr Loftus said although he did not expect policy details immediately, he would gain confidence from knowing the government's direction of travel. He added that the farming industry was doing ""great things"" in the environment and ""too little"" of it counted towards its carbon footprint. ""Beef, for example, is criticised for having a high carbon footprint,"" Mr Loftus said. ""But when you look at the sequestration occurring on our farms, that needs to be netted off and understood because it's a complicated picture and we're only getting one side of it at the moment."" A West Yorkshire beef and sheep uplands farmer said she saw the change in leadership as a ""blank sheet of paper"". Rachel Hallos, from Ripponden, told the BBC: ""I think farmers are being dragged in all different directions for quite a length of time now, for all different sorts of reasons. ""I actually think I'm quite excited about what the future could hold, if I'm very honest."" Ms Hallos said government policy and weather had resulted in a ""rough ride"" for farmers. ""I think for any business to invest in themselves and grow, which is what we need to do as an industry, we need that confidence,"" she said. Ms Hallos hoped that ""some stability"" would encourage farmers to deliver more. Angela Kirkwood had a farm near Hull, where she worked as a pig and arable farmer, as well as running a small farm shop. She told the BBC a lot of new MPs would be from urban areas but hoped they would embrace the opportunity to engage with the countryside and use it to grow the economy.  ""We’ve had so many people that can’t get any crops planted and it’s been tough,"" Ms Kirkwood said. ""Farm inflation is still through the roof. You have machinery costs, labour costs, there’s so many variables and so much volatility."" She added the farm industry wanted to achieve the ambition that ""food security is national security"". New Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Steve Reed attended the Great Yorkshire Show just a few days into his role. He told the BBC his government was going to offer farmers a ""new deal"", after they expressed feeling abandoned. ""We’re looking at how we can cut the single biggest cost that has gone up, helping to put so many farmers sadly out of business, which is energy,"" Mr Reed said. He outlined plans to set up GB Energy to cut bills for farmers and to renegotiate a deal with the EU, to ""get British exports moving across the border again"". Mr Reed also explained Labour's pledge to have 50% of government-procured food to be produced in Britain. “The government itself buys an awful lot of food and it doesn’t buy enough of it British,"" he said. The plans include the food purchased to be served in hospitals and on Army bases. ""That’s money directly into the pockets of farmers, so they can invest more and market their Great British produce,"" Mr Reed added. ""Farming is an absolute priority - food security is national security.""  Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram. Send your story ideas to yorkslincs.news@bbc.co.uk"
Volatility,Expansion plans at school for autistic girls cancelled,2024-09-25,2024-07-11,Chris Caulfield,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ck7g33glwxyo,"The planned expansion of a Surrey school for autistic girls has been cancelled due to council budget shortfalls. Limpsfield Grange School, near Oxted, had consulted on plans for a £15.3m expansion to help cover a shortfall of specialist places in the county, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. The school expects demand for specialist places for autistic girls across both secondary and post-16 ages to rise by 67% by 2030 compared with 2021 levels. Clare Curran, cabinet member for children at Surrey County Council, said construction industry market volatility was impacting on development plans. She said the authority was determined to create additional specialist provision to ""ensure the best possible outcomes for Surrey’s children"". Sarah Wild, the school's headteacher, said: “Sadly we have to announce that the proposed expansion of Limpsfield Grange School, to include a sixth form and places for additional students, has been cancelled by Surrey County Council due to shortfalls in their budget. “Naturally everyone at Limpsfield Grange is extremely disappointed."" She thanked everyone who had supported the expansion plans during the consultation process for their ""time, energy and commitment"". Limpsfield Grange School is a school for autistic girls and provides specialist education for girls aged 11 to 16 years with a permanent capacity of 94 places. Construction to provide an additional 60 places, plus a further 40 sixth form spaces, was set to begin in 2025. The project, part of Surrey County Council’s SEND capital programme, had been approved by the county’s cabinet in January 2022. Ms Curran said high levels of inflation, continued unstable market conditions, increasing need and fixed Government funding had affected costs. She added that it was now costing more to deliver the remaining approved plans within the £189m budget. She pointed to the council's £260m total investment to create new school places and expansion of state-maintained specialist education in Surrey. “We know how important it is to place a child in a setting that is appropriate for their educational needs, safety and wellbeing, and we are determined to create additional specialist provision to ensure the best possible outcomes for Surrey’s children,"" she added.

Volatility,'A chance to shake off failure and secure legendary status',2024-09-25,2024-07-13,Dan Roan,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c3gwn382e3qo,"Gareth Southgate's England secured their place in the Euro 2024 final with victory over the Netherlands For so long a symbol of serial sporting underachievement, the England men’s football team stand on the threshold of what would be a seminal achievement. Sunday night's European Championship final (kick-off 20:00 BST) represents a chance to shake off the failure that had come to define the side, and secure legendary status for the players and their manager. And with many millions watching on, provide the country with a moment of togetherness. One that will be cherished for generations to come. Gareth Southgate’s side has made a habit of reaching the business end of major tournaments over recent years, a rare source of consistency in the national landscape at a time of political volatility. Indeed, during the manager’s eight years in charge, there has been five UK prime ministers. The comparison is apt, because as well as leading a team that forms part of the country’s identity, Southgate has been expected to comment on a range of societal issues during his tenure - one that coincided with the Covid pandemic, a cost-of-living crisis, and division. Few sporting figures would have handled such a challenge with as much thought and eloquence. ""We live in what’s been an angry country. I would love that to be different as we move forward. Hopefully we can bring some temporary happiness,"" Southgate said, as he prepared for Sunday’s final against Spain, alluding to his strong sense of patriotism, the criticism he received during the early stages of the Euros, and the forces of pride, joy and unity that victory would unleash. This video can not be played Euro 2024: Reaching final 'feels a little bit more normal' for England - Southgate Whatever happens against opponents Spain in Berlin, Southgate’s legacy as the man who nursed the England team back to health is already assured. No other manager of the men’s side has reached a major overseas final. No other has reached a Euros final, let alone two in consecutive tournaments. The moments of individual brilliance, courage and never-say-die resolve of his men have restored pride. The dismal cycle of humiliations, penalty shootout defeats, resignations, reviews, scandals and divided squads that came to define the team over two decades has been consigned to history. Young talent has been introduced, loyalty has been afforded to a core group of players, preparation has been professionalised, the shirt no longer weighs heavily. Southgate took charge of England in 2016, but his attempts to help restore credibility to English football had begun five years earlier when he joined the Football Association (FA) as its new director of elite development, before managing the under-21s. His early years coincided with the opening of the national football centre at St George’s Park and the introduction of the 'England DNA' - a coaching strategy designed to boost elite performance. Southgate was a key part of the effort that laid the foundations for England’s under-17s and under-20s winning World Cups, and the under-19s becoming European champions. And yet, for all the strides the senior team has made under his leadership, silverware has remained stubbornly elusive. The years since their only major title - the 1966 World Cup - have continued to tick by. Brilliance, luck and resilience - how England reached Euro 2024 final Will Foden get the better of Rodri? Five key battles 'Southgate stands on brink of glorious vindication' While England's Lionesses delivered a seismic Euros triumph in 2022 on home soil, the nation’s first major football trophy for 56 years, the men’s team has continued to fall agonisingly close. World Cup semi-finalists in 2018. Finalists at the Euros in 2021. Quarter-finalists at the World Cup a year later. The eventual disappointment on each of these occasions only reinforced the sense held by some that Southgate was destined to be the nearly man of English football. A manager who may have revitalised the side from the ignominy of previous years, but who did not quite have what it took to deliver the glory the country craved. Such sentiments have echoed around England’s campaign in Germany, as the team initially produced laboured performances that failed to match the elevated expectations surrounding an exceptional generation of players. Southgate struggled to get the balance of the team right, and eyebrows were raised when he said he was still ""experimenting"" with his midfield. Some pundits criticised his side in the harshest possible terms, and cups of beer were even thrown at the manager by some fans after a goalless draw against Slovenia. It was clear that the scrutiny upset Southgate, as the pressure built. England needed a last-gasp comeback to avoid what would have been a devastating defeat by Slovakia in the last 16, then scraped past Switzerland on penalties. Only against the Netherlands in the semi-final, when England had to come from behind for the third match in a row, enjoying some good fortune when awarded a penalty, did they finally produce the kind of football that justified their pre-tournament billing as favourites. This video can not be played Euro 2024: Everything will be crossed for England - Lineker But that rousing victory amid an atmosphere of shuddering intensity, earned Southgate another chance to silence the critics that clearly affected his morale in Germany. To confound those who, despite the resilience of his side, and the way his tactics, selections and substitutions have largely been vindicated at this tournament, suggest he has benefitted from favourable draws. Those who believed he had taken the side as far as he could and who would have preferred that he had walked away from the job after the last World Cup, as he came close to doing after sensing faith in him was fading. Those who would have preferred that he and his players ""stick to football"", a view the manager firmly rejected in 2021 when he wrote: ""Our players are role models. And, beyond the confines of the pitch, we must recognise the impact they can have on society. I have a responsibility to the wider community to use my voice, and so do the players. It’s their duty to continue to interact with the public on matters such as equality, inclusivity and racial injustice."" Few will be criticising Southgate for such a stand if England triumph in Berlin. None will argue he is lucky if his side can overcome the might of Spain - a genuine footballing heavyweight, boasting world-class players - the most impressive team at these Euros. If his side can join the Lionesses as European champions, and the 58-year itch is finally scratched. And if - in his 102nd match in charge - he joins Sir Alf Ramsey as the only men to lead England to a major title. Almost three decades ago, as an England player, Southgate suffered the pain and regret of missing a decisive penalty at Wembley in the semi-finals of the Euros against Germany. Three years ago he could only watch as some of his young players suffered the same fate at the same stadium, as England lost to Italy in another shootout, this time in the final. Now, in the epic surroundings of Berlin’s Olympic Stadium, on European football’s grandest stage, and in what many believe will be his last match as manager, he can finally exorcise those demons, and heal the wounds of those memories. As a nation stops to watch, and dares to dream, Southgate’s story of redemption can be completed. And England’s long, long wait can end.

Volatility,Mental health tragedy lessons not learned - family,2024-09-25,2024-07-11,Nelli Bird,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9x8wj0xlero,"The son-in-law of an 88-year-old man who was killed by a woman with schizophrenia at a supermarket says too many people are being harmed due to a lack of proper risk assessments of mental health patients. Zara Radcliffe killed John Rees and injured three other people at the Co-op store in Penygraig, Rhondda Cynon Taf, in May 2020. An inquest found there were “missed opportunities” to assess her mental health leading up to the attack, with her later telling police: “I knew I would kill someone today.” Patrick Houston said there was ""little sign"" that mental health services were learning from similar situations, which happened ""all too often"". Mr Houston said the family were ""not surprised"" that Mr Rees had ""done the right thing"", but more had to be done to prevent others being killed. ""The cost of effective care for these patients may be high, but those with responsibility in this area should bear in mind that the cost to the many people affected by such cases is immeasurably higher,"" he said. Coroner Graeme Hughes recorded a narrative verdict, and said Mr Rees was “unlawfully killed” by Radcliffe, who was 30 when she was detained under a hospital order for the attack five months later. He found the way the community mental health team - made up of Rhondda Cynon Taf social workers and medical staff from Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board -  monitored Radcliffe after she was released from hospital was “insufficient”. Ayette Bounouri, who tried to drag Mr Rees to safety, said she will be traumatised for the rest of her life. Mrs Bounouri used a shopping basket in an effort to disarm Radcliffe. Radcliffe used wine bottles and a fire extinguisher to assault Mr Rees, another man and two women. Mr Rees was killed when he tried to stop Radcliffe. Mrs Bounouri, who was awarded the Queen's Gallantry Medal for bravery for her actions, said: ""We are grateful for his sacrifice but we live with the pain of his loss."" She added: ""I have learned to live with the trauma, but I am aware that it's going to be with me for the rest of my life. ""What happened was tragic, unnecessary and traumatic."" Speaking after Mr Rees's inquest, Mrs Bounouri said he was a ""true gentleman"" who was loved by the community. The coroner found a planned phone call with Radcliffe on 30 April did not happen and that, if it had, it was “more likely than not” that Radcliffe’s care co-ordinator would have become aware she not been staying at home or taking her medication. He added that their failure to complete an updated risk assessment when she was in the community probably further contributed to Mr Rees's death and was another ""missed opportunity"". Recording a narrative verdict at the court in Pontypridd, the coroner found that Mr Rees was ""unlawfully killed” and that the “assailant was suffering from psychosis and symptoms were not being managed"". The four-day inquest heard that Radcliffe's father Wayne had raised concerns about her on the day of the attack. He made multiple phone calls to the crisis mental health team, telling them she had started taking recreational drugs again. He said his daughter had become ""withdrawn and agitated"". No one called him back, but a care coordinator did make plans to visit the home later that day. At about 14:00 BST, Radcliffe made her way to the supermarket and used wine bottles and a fire extinguisher to attack her four victims. She later told police: “I knew I would kill someone today.” Radcliffe was then sent to Rampton high security hospital and, in October 2020, detained indefinitely. She admitted manslaughter on the basis of diminished responsibility and the attempted murder of three others. The inquest was told Radcliffe had previously assaulted a police officer and medical staff. Some of the team who treated her during a four-month inpatient stay at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital gave evidence, outlining a diagnosis of schizophrenia with symptoms including aggression and volatility and hearing voices which she believed would harm her. The court heard that, after two weeks of consistently taking an antipsychotic drug, they believed she was improving and that at discharge on 24 February 2020, was considered a low risk. Her care was handed over to the community mental health team but she had only two interactions with them in the next ten weeks, in part due to Covid restrictions. Paul Mears, chief executive of Cwm Taf Morgannwg UHB, said the health board had learned from the case, establishing an adult mental health inpatient improvement board ""to ensure we continually focus on the delivery of high quality, safe and effective care to the service users and carers in contact with our mental health inpatient services"". He added that a recent review of inpatient mental health services at the Royal Glamorgan ""acknowledged the significant improvements"". Rhondda Cynon Taf council apologised to Mr Rees's family and everyone else affected, and said it ""will now work with its partners to review the conclusion and address any areas for improvement identified in the verdict""."
Volatility,"As Keir Starmer heads to the US, Labour readies for a possible Trump presidency",2024-09-25,2024-07-09,James Landale,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn05yyn941qo,"When it comes to Britain’s relationship with the United States, the new government has a simple watchword: continuity. One of Sir Keir Starmer’s first calls in office was to President Joe Biden. Unusually, Downing Street even published footage and audio of the prime minister making the call. To the relief of officials, Mr Biden uttered the words “special relationship”. With those words ringing, Mr Starmer heads to Washington DC this week for the Nato summit where he and his wife will attend a dinner at the White House. To the even greater relief of officials, the President will hold a private meeting with the prime minister, not something all Nato leaders will get. The PM is going mob-handed with his defence and foreign secretaries, John Healey and David Lammy. The message could not be clearer: the transatlantic relationship remains the bedrock of UK foreign policy. Much will be made of Mr Lammy’s American credentials: he has lived, studied and worked in the US. He has family there; his father is buried in Texas. He boasts regularly that he has visited the US more than France. But it would be a mistake to think Labour is throwing its lot in with a politically sympathetic Democratic president and administration. “Whoever is in the White House or Number 10 in a big election year, we must work together,” Mr Lammy told the Institute for Government recently, nodding towards the prospect of Donald Trump re-entering the White House. Back in 2018, Mr Lammy called the former US president “a woman-hating, neo-Nazi-sympathizing sociopath” and a “profound threat to the international order”. It wasn’t a one off: he has also accused Mr Trump of promoting racism and separately labelled him a fascist. Since then, the foreign secretary has been on quite a journey and has been working hard to build a relationship with Republicans and allies of Mr Trump. In recent months he has met an array of Trump campaign advisers - past and present - along with Republican members of Congress, including possible Trump running mate JD Vance, whom Mr Lammy refers to as “my friend”. And in a speech to the conservative Hudson Institute in Washington in May, Mr Lammy said Mr Trump’s uncertain commitment to European security had been “misunderstood”. The message from both Downing Street and the Foreign Office is this Labour government will work with whoever lives in 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Yet Labour’s preparation for a possible Trump presidency is not limited to pragmatic engagement with his team. The government is also preparing a foreign policy that assumes the long-term trend of US detachment from Europe will continue, alongside growing economic protectionism and a greater focus on domestic US issues. And that will mean the UK doing less with the US and more with other international partners. Take Europe. In recent days both Mr Starmer and Mr Lammy have emphasised their plans to agree a defence and security pact with the European Union (EU), most likely a non-legally binding political declaration. They have made clear they envisage a broad definition of security, including anything from energy and climate change to pandemics and illegal migration. It could even involve some kind of UK participation in the European Defence Fund, the body that coordinates EU cooperation on defence research. There is talk of an early bilateral defence agreement with Germany. Mr Lammy may attend a meeting of EU foreign ministers in September. On one level this is Labour’s way of trying to reset Britain’s relationship with the EU post-Brexit, using defence as a way of building bridges and fostering trust. They hope this could eventually help to improve trade relations with the EU - to boost economic growth - while not unpicking the Brexit settlement, a political row they wish to avoid. But the policy is also a more fundamental recognition that Europe as a continent needs to do more to defend itself and rely less on America’s security blanket. This is equally true of Ukraine. Kyiv fears US support could weaken if Mr Trump is re-elected. Much of this week’s Nato summit will be about how the alliance can “future proof” military support for Ukraine against American political volatility. Labour has gone out of its way to show that London’s backing will remain “iron-clad” despite the change in government, sending Mr Healey on a visit and announcing more military aid within hours of his appointment. But none of this will be easy. Labour is promising to increase defence spending to 2.5% of national output, currently about 2.3%. But that will happen only when a strategic defence review is completed and the Treasury says there is enough tax revenue in its coffers, two conditions no one expects to be achieved soon. And as for greater cooperation with the EU on defence, that will have to wait for the new European Commission to be formed later this year; it will come at a cost of long and difficult negotiations involving many compromises demanded by EU member states; and few expect France to allow the UK much access to lucrative European defence markets by easing EU procurement rules. On climate change, Mr Lammy wants to forge what he calls a “clean power alliance” of developed and developing countries that are committed to generating renewable energy in coming years. He envisages a kind of energy alliance similar to that among oil producing nations, namely OPEC. This is designed to reclaim some of the economic and technical market in renewables from China. But it is also a policy that does not involve the UK looking across the Atlantic and depending on a president who once described climate change as a hoax and who could take the US out of the Paris climate agreement. The foreign secretary has a similar approach towards developing countries, known collectively as the “global south”. He says he wants to “reconnect” the UK with countries that felt ignored or lectured by British ministers in the past, countries denied access to western Covid vaccines or adequate climate finance. The strategic aim – one also adopted by Mr Lammy’s predecessor, Lord Cameron – is to deny countries like China a free hand when it comes to diplomatic and trade opportunities in Africa and Asia. But again, this is a policy that does not involve the UK being dependent on what Washington is thinking. As for Britain’s relationship with China, Labour wants to “compete, challenge and cooperate” with Beijing. That is in stark contrast to bipartisan opinion in Washington that sees China as a long-term strategic threat. Labour is promising a full audit of UK-China relations. But if Donald Trump wins, there are fears he could trigger a full-scale trade war with China that could damage European economies and leave Labour’s central growth plan in ruins. Where the government has less room for manoeuvre is the Middle East. The US is the biggest player in the region and drives western policy. The UK has much less influence. Mr Lammy may at some point renew Britain’s funding for the UN agency in Gaza, UNWRA, drop a UK attempt to delay the International Criminal Court’s decision on issuing an arrest warrant for Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and even restrict UK arms sales to Israel. This would ruffle feathers in Washington but might be seen by analysts as internal Labour politics designed to counter the loss of a handful of seats to pro-Gaza candidates in last week's general election. It would not change the fundamentals on the ground which remain bleak. There are growing fears of a possible Israeli attack on Hezbollah in Lebanon with bloodshed on a mass and devastating scale. Would the UK support any US military action? Would Mr Starmer deploy British forces in harms’ way to rescue British nationals in Beirut? With US political leadership so uncertain, the government is having to hedge its geopolitical bets. Mr Lammy may be an avowed Atlanticist. But his first official words as foreign secretary did not mention the US once. Instead he declared: “We will begin with a reset with Europe, on climate and the global south.” BBC InDepth is the new home on the website and app for the best analysis and expertise from our top journalists.

Volatility,Gareth Lewis: Election has Welsh and UK Labour at odds,2024-09-25,2024-07-03,Gareth Lewis,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj50r64j4y8o,"It ends as it began. Wet. From the downpour of Downing Street to the drizzle of Caerfyrddin, the seat where Keir Starmer and Rhun ap Iorwerth campaigned on Wednesday. The weather hasn’t changed and neither have the polls. But some of what has happened in between suggests a turbulent Welsh political climate in the two years ahead. One of those clouds is the relationship between UK Labour and Welsh Labour.  The two parts of the party are at odds over more powers and more money coming to Wales. Sir Keir made a big play - again - of fighting hard to save jobs at Tata Steel in Port Talbot, in conjunction with the Welsh government. It is less clear how much cash or further devolution of power will come. He described two Labour governments working together as a ""double opportunity"". They’ll need to prove that to voters not only to reward what looks like a lot of Welsh support, but also with the 2026 Senedd election already looming. There is also the question of who Sir Keir might be dealing with as Wales' first minister by that point. Vaughan Gething is under pressure and, as it stands, it is unclear how he could pass a budget. Plaid Cymru leader Rhun ap Iorwerth also began his final day campaigning in Caerfyrddin - the Welsh name for Carmarthen - a seat a poll on Tuesday suggested is too close to call. They are targeting Labour voters who feel let down, yet their perennial problem remains: winning their target seats. But again that’s not the whole story - they’re looking good at the moment for 2026, when things are looking the polar opposite for Labour. The Conservatives have not had a good campaign, although they still have a puncher’s chance in some Welsh seats. They have doubled down - and will double down - on the Welsh Labour government’s record especially on the 20mph law and the NHS. But has the fight gone out of them?  And its not just cabinet ministers already conceding defeat live on BBC radio. At time of writing we have not been able to pin down where they’re actually campaigning in Wales on the final day. Reform are now neck and neck with the Tories according to the polls, although under the first past the post system are not likely to win any seats. But under a proportional representation system in the Senedd election they could be a far more potent threat. It was no accident that they launched their UK manifesto in the south Wales valleys - where they think they have a lot of support. Keep an eye on their percentage share on Thursday night. But this election does look like it belongs to Labour. Change has been their 2024 campaign mantra. Come 2026 and the Senedd election they will have been 27 years in power in Cardiff Bay. That mantra might well be turned against them by their opponents."
Volatility,Scotland's general election explained in numbers,2024-09-25,2024-07-05,Philip Sim,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpv3ydex017o,"The obvious election headline in Scotland is Labour’s comeback amid an SNP collapse. Labour gained 36 seats from the SNP to add to the one they had from 2019, sweeping their rivals out of the central belt. The SNP is stuck on single figures, with nine - a huge fall - while the Lib Dems leapfrogged the Tories into third place with six seats to their five. It’s worse for John Swinney than most polls had predicted, and indeed worse than his party could possibly have feared. So what can we dig out of the results data which explains such a result? One easy explanation for improvement in a party’s fortunes is that more people vote for them. Labour’s share of the vote went up enormously - up 16.7 percentage points, to 35.3%. That’s higher than the 34.4% the party won in England, where their share ticked up by only 0.5 points. While Sir Keir Starmer’s candidates down south profited chiefly from the Tory vote collapsing (they lost six million votes) and Reform UK surging, the picture in Scotland was a little more nuanced. Here, there were two collapses to factor in. The SNP lost half a million votes, their share falling 15 percentage points to 30%. Meanwhile, the Scottish Conservative share was almost halved, down 12.4 percentage points to 12.7%.  When you factor in turnout, the Tories actually did lose more than half of the votes they won in 2019. This was especially pronounced in central belt seats, and it was the combination of those two changes which boosted Labour to come through the middle. In a number of seats they actually came from third place - consider East Renfrewshire, where Labour went from 12.4% of the vote to 43.7%, an incredible turnaround. One part of the story is the first past the post voting system. In previous elections it’s helped sweep the SNP to crushing victories; now the all-or-nothing system has turned back to bite them. Labour have won 65% of the seats in Scotland with 35% of the vote. The SNP meanwhile had 30% of the vote - but won 17.5% of the seats on offer. The Lib Dems - ironically the greatest proponents of electoral reform - have had the closest to a representative result, with 10.5% of the seats from 9.7% of the vote. The Tories returned 8.7% of the seats with 12.1% of the vote. This has all sparked a debate about whether UK elections should move to proportional representation - a system more similar to the one used in Scottish Parliament polls. There are other ways in which Scotland has become a contest between the SNP and Labour. Other than the 10 seats held by the Lib Dems and Tories, almost every seat is now a contest between the SNP and Labour. The Tories were in second place in 18 seats prior to this election; that figure is now down to five. Two of those seats are pretty marginal - both of the Moray seats have an SNP majority of around 2.5%. But otherwise there is a lack of clear targets for the Conservatives to build towards when they are planning their recovery. Given the party is also looking for new leaders both at Westminster and Holyrood, and it’s clear the Tories are in a bit of a pickle. Scotland is no stranger to big swings in the vote; volatility is baked into our political DNA. Consider that Lothian East has now returned a different MP at every election since 2005. Meanwhile, Dundee Central has gone from being the safest seat in the country before the election, to the most marginal after it - now having a majority of just 1.7%, or 675 votes. The SNP used to preside over big majorities, but now seven of its nine seats are among the most marginal in Scotland. They only have two which could be considered safe, with a double-digit majority. The worst SNP collapse was in Na h-Eileanan an Iar, where former party MP Angus MacNeil was running as an independent, contributing to their vote share dropping by 24 percentage points. The next worst performances were in Alloa and Grangemouth, where John Nicolson lost 23.8 points of share, and in Edinburgh South West where Joanna Cherry lost 20.4 points. The Lib Dems now defend the safest seat in Scotland in Orkney and Shetland (majority 37.7%), and remain the absolute kings of localised campaigning. They have three of the four safest seats in Scotland, with Edinburgh West and North East Fife also having majorities over 30%. But they also lost their deposit in 30 seats, failing to break 5% of the vote, and their share was down in 43 of the 57 seats. It was still a great night for the Lib Dems, given they ended with six seats - including the emotional recapture of Inverness, Skye and West Ross-Shire, once home to their former leader Charles Kennedy. But like the Tories, they don’t have a lot of obvious target seats where they could spread their influence in future. Talking of deposits, the Conservatives lost 16 - up from zero in 2019, and a worse total than Reform UK, who only lost ten. Indeed Reform overtook them in 25 seats, mostly in the central belt. The Tories fell below 5% of the vote in all six of the Glasgow seats, the opposite of the performance of the Scottish Greens. The Greens didn’t come close to winning any seats, but it did finish third in a couple in Glasgow and Edinburgh - and in four, their share of the vote was greater than Labour’s eventual majority. Obviously votes don’t belong to any one party and could break in unpredictable directions, but the SNP may be ruing their fallout with their former governing partners in those seats in particular. The Greens meanwhile are delighted with their returns - having doubled the number of candidates they stood this year, they will feel they have carved out fresh footholds. Talking of splits in the pro-independence vote, one which decidedly did not materialise was in the role of Alex Salmond’s Alba Party. Their 19 candidates didn’t crack 12,000 votes in total - the best performance coming from Neale Hanvey, who managed 2.8% in Cowdenbeath and Kirkcaldy, which he has represented for the last five years. Three other former MPs - Kenny MacAskill, George Kerevan and Corri Wilson - failed to get above 1.5% of the vote. Alba have their hopes chiefly pinned on the next Holyrood election, and its proportional representation system - but these kind of figures even make gains there look like a long shot. The key comfort for the SNP may be that this was a low-turnout election, with voter participation at 59.2%. That’s down 8.4 percentage points from 2019, and was reflected in every seat. A dozen seats had turnout down more than 10%. The worst falls were in Edinburgh North and Leith and Airdrie and Shotts, with the vote falling by 13.6%. So when John Swinney is trying to work out where half a million SNP votes went, he might conclude that many of them could have stayed at home. The same thing hit the party in 2017, when they lost 21 seats - and many of them were won back in 2019, when turnout rose again. The low turnout also means some majorities are not as big as they look. Glasgow North is technically considered a safe-ish seat with a 10.2% Labour majority, but the SNP were only 3,539 votes behind. That may be some comfort to the SNP as they look to the future. So even hours after the counting has finished, most of the parties will already be turning their attention to the Holyrood election in 2026 - some looking to consolidate their gains, and others hoping to bounce back."
Volatility,Inside Keir Starmer's preparations for power,2024-09-25,2024-07-06,Laura Kuenssberg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c725z55d75ko,"“A face of thunder.” As opposition leader, Sir Keir Starmer would go back to his office after the State Opening of Parliament deeply frustrated after witnessing the Conservatives’ plans laid out year after year. He carried the curse of the leader of the opposition – irrelevance. He formally became prime minister at lunchtime on Friday, but for a number of months now, he has also known that the British state has been quietly preparing for his arrival in Downing Street. “We have every hour of his first day, every day of his first week, every week of his first month, mapped out,"" is how one Whitehall source put it. What promise this victory holds is not going to fail because of a lack of homework or planning. Such is the level of preparation that the Treasury, in anticipation of the arrival of the first female chancellor, has apparently boxed in the urinal that has long been a feature of the chancellor’s private bathroom. Not exactly bog standard stuff, you could say (sorry!). Sign up for the Off Air with Laura K newsletter to get Laura Kuenssberg's expert insight and insider stories every week, emailed directly to you.  Rachel Reeves is one of the prominent figures in Sir Keir’s team, among them also Wes Streeting and Bridget Phillipson, who have been deeply involved for months in getting ready to govern. Senior civil servants and their shadow ministers have been talking for some time and Sir Keir and some of his team have been regular attendees at Cobra meetings, and security briefings. One, now a cabinet minister, told me: “We have got personal relationships with the permanent secretary and the senior officials already.“ The former civil servant Sue Gray, who will now be the PM's chief of staff, has been in regular contact with Cabinet Secretary Sir Simon Case, since the turn of the year. After the headlines of the Labour leader's missions had been turned into policies, they were then made into “implementation plans"" for government. The calls between Ms Gray and Sir Simon became almost daily. There has been some perhaps less obvious assistance, too. At least two former Conservative ministers have been helping them prepare, including one recent cabinet minister who told me: “It’s ridiculous we just hand over a trillion pound budget” without the kind of transition that an American president, for example, enjoys. Despite the scale of victory, the Labour manifesto, based on Sir Keir’s mission, is not about to be usurped with a huge bold unknown move. “There are no secrets,” one senior figure told me. Another source told me the election result is a vindication of the PM's cautious approach and it is not a “vote for a more radical, bold approach”. Expect strong resistance to any calls from the left that the scale of the change “proves” Labour could have been more radical in what they put forward. Some in his party may demand a rapid cessation of arm sales to Israel. Labour losing seats and nearly losing others to opponents standing on a pro-Gaza platform will only make those calls more urgent. Other demands may include an overt commitment to safeguard public services, a longer-term promise to remove the two-child benefit cap and even regular trade union access to No 10. But with a massive majority, there is no suggestion that Sir Keir will feel he is in the mood to redraft his carefully worked out plans. Instead the new prime minister has held up the result as a rejection of the Tory Party and a vote for a different type of leadership, and frankly, less drama. But his style, and the gradual way in which his plans were built over a period of many months, belies some very significant changes Labour wants. These include an expansion of rights for workers, a rapid overhaul of the planning system and a state energy company. In the short-term, new ministers are likely to do everything they can to talk up how they want to get the economy to grow. It won’t be entirely coincidental if within a few weeks, companies start writing cheques for the UK, or that pent -up investments that were waiting for a change of government start to come through. And it’s likely that before long there will be new draft laws to give more powers to the government’s independent economic watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility. One of the big first decisions the new chancellor needs to make is when to hold a huge review of the public finances with the teeth clenching decisions it might involve. The so-called spending review, which portions out cash between departments, expires at the end of the year. It sounds like a dull decision but it is massively important. Ms Reeves will have to decide whether to roll over the existing Tory spending plans for a year, to give her more space to work out a longer-term plan, or crack on with her own review by the end of 2024. Watch this space. The Labour mantra in public, and in private has been not just to win, but to be ready to get things done. In their mind are what they see as the lessons of New Labour and Tony Blair’s frustration with the slow pace of change. One new minister tells of a meeting where they briefed the former PM about their plans and he warned them: “I so deeply regret that we didn’t hit the ground running on reform."" “Keir has taken this incredibly seriously,"" the minister told me. Appointing the cabinet’s been done, but there are dozens of other MPs to receive government jobs, with advisers and new members of the House of Lords. They include the former Chief Scientific Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance who has been appointed as a minister of state at the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology.  I’m told the former health secretary, Alan Milburn, is likely to take a senior, though not ministerial, role at the Department of Health to help drive waiting lists down. Other departments and other appointments might throw up some interesting names. But for all the preparation and experience, the receipt of power and responsibility is huge. One official said of incoming prime ministers: “They come in exhausted from this now-seemingly endless campaign, they come in elated, they appoint their cabinet – that is a great moment for them. And then sour-faced people like me say, ‘now, can I talk to you about the end of the world!’” Sir Keir is in a hurry not just to show the public that his government can actually get things done after years of visible political shambles. But he’s also been counselled to make the most of the early goodwill from his vast ranks of new victors, before, inevitably in time, however long, the Parliamentary Labour Party starts to flex its muscles. One former Labour adviser told me, he should ""Go quick! Go fast, before they find the loos!"" It is true that his team has tried very hard to control the quality of candidates, and many loyalists will be picking up their pass for the first day in the big palace soon. But as former prime ministers have found, bright-eyed new recruits don’t stay eager forever. Labour’s scale of victory is something they could have hardly dreamed of not so long ago. But their elation this weekend doesn’t make some of the very tricky realities of governing go away.  Whenever she’s been near a microphone in recent months, Ms Reeves has been warning of what she calls the ""worst economic inheritance since the Second World War"" or as she said at her election count in Leeds ""there is not a huge amount of money"". Waiting lists are sky high. Prisons are overcrowded. Millions of families are struggling to make ends meet. This was an election result driven partly by voters’ clear feeling that nothing works. That sense is not confined to public perception. As one senior Whitehall official told me: “Things really are worse on the inside than you can see from outside."" Labour’s ministerial teams have been discussing how to tell the public how bad, in their view, things really are. No sooner had Mr Streeting been appointed health secretary than he said: “From today the policy of this department is that the NHS is broken.” A sceptic might also say Labour will be keen to brand the problems once and for all as the Tories’ fault. What of the new PM himself? It’s not lost on the public, or his political critics, that he has been willing to junk old promises, and indeed, to junk old colleagues if need be. His backers say it’s a sign of strength, and was a lesson he had to learn - ditching what one source described as “nauseating” pleas for party unity for a clearer priority, the desire to win. It is no easier now to get to the bottom of what Sir Keir believes in than it was when I first sat down with him. Back then he was pitching for the leadership of his party, when his aim to get them back into power looked fanciful. He and his team had come up with the phrase “moral socialism”. Then, as now, it sounded like a slogan designed for a Guardian newspaper headline rather than something the public could latch on to. He told me he wanted to persuade people that Labour and politicians could be a “force for good and a force for change“. That’s a line that could feature in one of his many interviews or speeches four years later, where still, you might be searching for a grand ideological mantra. But perhaps to hunt for an ideology is to miss the point. He is not a factional politician who’s been in the trade, man and boy, not a product of student union elections, decades of party conferences, fevered debates about the purity of particular policies. For his backers, that arguable absence of an ideology is his huge advantage. “He’ll be the most normal PM we’ve ever had,” says one insider. One minister tells me he belongs not to any faction but to the party. “He is theirs,” the new minister says. Whether Sir Keir can make the public feel that kind of direct connection with him as a leader seems ambitious and highly uncertain. He sometimes apes Tony Blair, saying he’ll return politics to serve the people through what he terms national renewal. But despite the size of the majority, there is little sign at this moment that he could achieve that kind of incredible personal popularity the 1997 victor saw. It was Sir Keir’s belief that the modern electorate could be incredibly volatile that led him to have faith that he could turn the 2019 disaster round. The willingness of so many voters to change their minds has been Keir Starmer’s friend at this election but if that volatility is here to stay, it could become his foe. In time, and perhaps soon, Labour will start plotting privately how this term in office can be extended into what Starmer has already set out as his goal of a “decade of renewal“. Just before polling day, one insider joked: “I’m never not thinking about winning the next election.” By any traditional measure, a majority on this scale would see a prime minister securely locked into two terms of office. But in 2024 that feels less certain. For now for Labour, there is a moment of profound celebration. No more the impotence of opposition. No more the pain of losing yet again. No more “face of thunder” for the new prime minister, or the frustration of being irrelevant. As we saw in Downing Street yesterday, after all the waiting, he can allow himself a smile.

Volatility,Jersey has 'good opportunity' to become crypto hub,2024-09-25,2024-07-01,Calum Riva,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3gvx4nwyqeo,"Jersey has a ""good opportunity"" to become a major centre for crypto technology, according to a specialist in digital currency. Nathan de la Haye, 26, founder of BlockWise, said the island's financial services industry and its clear regulatory guidelines made it an ideal place for crypto businesses. But he also said he believed local companies needed to change their perspective to take advantage of digital currency. He said: “A lot of people think it's just a get-rich-quick scheme, and don't really treat it seriously."" Mr de la Haye explained that companies in Jersey could be cautious about the price volatility of cryptocurrencies. But he said: “The size of the industry means you can't really ignore it any more”. The global cryptocurrency market cap is more than $4.2 trillion, according to cryptocurrency market data platform CoinMarketCap. Mr de la Haye explained that the Jersey Financial Services Commission (JFSC) was open to adopting cryptocurrencies and had provided clear guidance for businesses. “They recognise the potential that this technology can have, so they have put the framework in place,” he added. In 2014, the JFSC approved the world’s first regulated Bitcoin investment fund, GABI Plc. Finance industry leader Jason Laity said this was certainly “a sign of a progressive regulatory environment”. However, he stressed that the “regulator must tread a fine line” between supporting crypto and making sure the island's reputation remained intact. He said that the island's reputation was “massively important for the financial services industry” and any emerging fast pace sector needed to be carefully regulated. Mr de la Haye founded BlockWise to consult with businesses in Jersey on crypto technology. He launched his company with the help of Digital Jersey's Tech Start Up Bootcamp. “Having more companies creating new financial products and services related to blockchain and cryptocurrency would be really exciting,” he said. Mr Laity said there was certainly a lot of activity in Jersey, so there was no reason why the number of cryptocurrency start-ups could not increase.

Volatility,The electronic music star bringing new life to Jeremy Clarkson's farm,2024-09-25,2024-06-30,Aleks Phillips,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cxxxz83xwy5o,"​​As one half of Groove Armada, Andy Cato has been an electronic music star for nearly three decades. But he has never been asked for as many selfies as he has since appearing on the latest series of Jeremy Clarkson’s farming show. He did not go on Clarkson's Farm – which follows the presenter as he grapples with running his Oxfordshire farm – for renewed fame. Rather, his aim was to expose its audience to his passion: regenerative farming. That is, moving towards a food system powered by biology rather than by chemistry, as he puts it. Regenerative farming seeks to reverse the biodiversity loss that modern farming can cause with fertilisers and pesticides by changing how crops are managed. On the hit Amazon Prime docu-series, Cato is invited onto Clarkson's Diddly Squat farm – so named because it makes him very little money – to take over one of the fields and demonstrate these nature-driven methods. The experiment was a success, and he has won over the former Top Gear presenter. “We started filming the next series a month ago now, and he wants to expand the area where we're embracing these techniques,” Cato tells the BBC. “So yeah, I think we got off to a good start.” While modern farming practices allow for the same fields to be used year after year to produce enough crops to feed consumers, they can remove organic content from fields, meaning farmers must add chemical fertilisers to sustain their crops. This can be costly for farmers and some scientists say it means the microbes and organic compounds that make healthy soil and nutrient-rich food are not necessarily being replenished, ultimately diminishing the ability of farmland to grow crops. Regenerative farming aims to reintroduce microbes, nutrients and carbon back into the soil. Some ways of doing this – which are already being taken up by farmers in the UK, India and elsewhere – include planting different crops side by side and sowing cover crops, which cover the soil in between harvests to retain its organic content. In the latest series of Clarkson’s Farm, Cato oversees the planting of two crops, wheat and beans, in the same field, rather than the traditional single crop. He says this is so the field can still be used to produce grain, with the beans providing some of the nitrogen needed to fertilise the soil. While this meant the yield of each was lower than if he had planted just one crop, Cato says this was compensated for by not having to pay for the 300kg of nitrogen usually needed to add artificially to the field. Much of Clarkson’s Farm is devoted to showing how upfront costs – such as feed, energy and fertiliser – can make farming a risky and often unprofitable profession. The government estimates that these made up nearly 70% of farmers’ expenses in 2023. The price of feed and fertiliser has also fluctuated dramatically in the past few years due to the war in Ukraine and energy price rises, while unpredictable weather has affected the quality – and therefore the value – of crops. “To all of the traditional risk that farmers have been shouldering for decades, we’re now adding massive climatic volatility and massive price volatility – and it's just not a reasonable ask,” Cato says. “We just can't keep doing this, and farmers won't keep doing this.” Using fertilisers and pesticides can also be costly for the environment – as they can kill off native species and leach into waterways. Cato says that he is currently running a pilot in which water companies pay farmers to adopt regenerative farming techniques, “because it's a lot cheaper [for them] – keeping the nitrates and the pesticides out of the river than getting them out afterwards”. But he admits the switch to regenerative farming can be challenging, as while it is “getting biology and nature to do more of the work... you're replacing a largely prescribed set of fertilization and treatments with observation and reaction”.  Soil is tested regularly and the nutrients added to the field adjusted according to what it is lacking. Putting this careful balance across in a TV show was “complicated and leads towards insomnia”, he says. Joe Stanley, a regenerative farmer and member of the National Farmers' Union environment forum, agrees that these techniques “require more attention to detail [and] probably more time and effort”. There are other potential trade-offs. While modern agriculture uses machinery to minimise labour costs, he says regenerative farming would likely require a larger workforce – which could raise food prices. But Mr Stanley argues retailers could also absorb this cost. “That’s one of the big problems of the transition to sustainable farming: how do we pay a fair price to the farmer for food which may be more expensive to produce?” Mr Stanley says harvesting two different crops from the same field can produce a higher combined yield, but also creates the cost of then sorting those two crops – something Cato's company covers. Lizzie Sagoo of agricultural consultancy Adas, who specialises in soil and crops, says that while techniques like cover crops provide a “suite of benefits” including improved yields, this would likely be outweighed by the cost of cultivating a crop farmers cannot harvest – requiring a further financial incentive. Cato also thinks that, despite the benefits of regenerative farming, the transition should not be put solely on farmers’ shoulders as “they're absolutely at the financial edge already.” The UK government currently offers farmers £129 per hectare of cover crops. And in May, Waitrose announced it would be offering financial assistance to farmers to convert, so its fresh produce was regeneratively farmed by 2035. So what inspired Cato to trade in his synthesizer for a muck spreader? He says it began with reading an article about the environmental consequences of food production on the way back from a gig. “It didn't paint a pretty picture. And it ended with the line: ‘If you don't like the system, don't depend on it.’ That line got me into buying books on self-sufficiency and trying to grow vegetables where we were living at the time in France.” It was in France that he sold his publishing rights to establish his first farm using regenerative practices – despite having no background in agriculture. This lack of farming heritage was picked up on by Kaleb Cooper, Diddly Squat’s local boy turned farm manager. In what Cato describes as “without question the line of the series”, the money-conscious Kaleb acerbically remarks: “Was you in a band? I can tell because you’ve left your tractor running at a pound per litre.” Cato says it was ironic as, when he lived in France, he was the only one in the area who would turn his engine off. “Because I’ve spent my life in noise, it drove me insane,” he explains. “So in France I was known [as] the annoying person who always turned their tractor off. But I got totally bested by Kaleb there, so I just need to wear that one.” Cato moved back to the UK and now 110 farms across the two countries are part of his regenerative farming movement – though he sees the number growing as “one of the things that needs to be challenged in that is the assumption that business as usual is an option”. The Global Environment Facility estimates that, due to a number of factors including farming practices, 95% of the world’s land could become degraded by 2050, making it unable to sustain crops at yields needed for consumption. Experts have warned that without efforts to combat soil degradation, there would only be a limited number of harvests left. But Cato remains hopeful that this is not a foregone conclusion. “If you give nature half a chance, it comes roaring back,” he says. “When you see those plants poking their way through a crack in the pavement, you know it has immense power... The speed of recovery if we get these things right is really profound.”"
Volatility,These seats have voted Tory for decades. That might be about to change,2024-09-25,2024-07-02,Nicholas Watt,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cl7y2xj728do,"In the dappled light of midsummer, on the country lanes and byways of Middle England, there is an unmistakable, if understated, feeling of rebellion. In seats that have mainly voted Conservative for the past century, the tide of blue appears to be on the way out, though there are few signs of affection for Labour. In the searing mid-morning heat, pensioners are slowly and carefully bending onto one knee as they roll weighty black balls down the bowling green in the heart of the Bournemouth East parliamentary constituency.  Bournemouth (divided into two parliamentary seats, East and West) has returned a Conservative or Unionist MP at every election since 1922. And yet unease with the Conservatives is in the air. Bob Kelly, 75, a stalwart of the club, gently lays out his frustrations from the club’s wooden veranda. “I have historically voted Conservative,” he tells me. “I don’t like Rishi Sunak. He is too wishy-washy. I am frightened of Labour. They lost control of spending last time. Nigel Farage’s party is too extreme. “I will probably vote Conservative because I just do not think there is anyone else to vote for.” An endorsement for the Conservatives, if hardly a ringing one. But the very fact that his backing for the party is wavering speaks volumes about the scale of the challenge the party is facing. BBC Newsnight Comprehensive coverage of the day's important national and international news stories. Watch on BBC iPlayer (UK only) Nearly 200 miles to the north is Radcliffe-on-Trent, a quiet village whose tree-lined high street falls in the shadow of the tower of St Mary’s church. The village lies in the heart of the mainly rural constituency of Rushcliffe, on the outskirts of Nottingham. It has returned a Conservative or Unionist MP at every election since 1918 apart from 1945 and 1966. Ken Clarke, the father figure of One Nation Tories, represented Rushcliffe from 1970 to 2019. Now there appears to be an appetite for change. Robbie Davison, 47, is nursing a cup of coffee in the grounds of the Grange Hall with his daughter’s dog, Joey. Mr Davison has a clear view of his decision. “I have been Conservative all my life, but I am ready for change,” he says. “I don’t really trust any of them but I will go for Labour this year. I think Labour will get the job done.” Sentiments such as these are causing alarm among some Tories. One former minister in the south tells me they have given up the ghost even though they are defending a rock-solid Tory seat. To have cast a vote in that seat in an election where the winning candidate was not a Conservative, you would have to have been born in the reign of Queen Victoria. The former minister says the only question in their mind now is the scale of their defeat. This mood is being picked up in the polls, though they should be treated with great care. Professor Sir John Curtice, Britain’s guru of psephology, says the giant multi-level regression polls (MRP) suggest an alarming picture for the Tories - that their vote is falling more sharply in seats they hold. These surveys, which rely on very large samples, often find a slightly lower national Labour lead over the Tories than the conventional polls, Prof Curtice says, but they currently suggest that the Tories could lose between 60 to 100 more seats than the usual extrapolation from conventional polls. From the conversations I’ve had with politicians and voters throughout the campaign, three factors have combined to eat into the Conservative vote. The first is voter fatigue with the Tories after 14 years in office, which involved chopping and changing between five prime ministers. While there often appears to be no great love for Labour, neither is there any fear of the party, traditionally its greatest electoral weakness. Finally, there has been a noticeable overall uptick in support for Reform UK after Nigel Farage entered the fray, with signs that his party has eaten into the Tory vote more than Labour’s. This has awakened hopes among the Liberal Democrats that they might stage a comeback or  capture new seats in the area they call the “blue wall” - previously strong Conservative areas in the Home Counties where the Lib Dems believe they are the main challenger to the Tories. Sir Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, once dismantled a mock blue wall after a Lib Dem by-election victory. The party chose this term as a play on the “red wall” - the once-strong Labour areas that voted Conservative in 2019.  Will the South East's 'blue wall' crumble?  A voice from one of these Tory heartlands made its mark briefly on the national stage. In a sweltering hall at Nottingham Trent University last Wednesday, where the BBC hosted the second and final head-to-head debate between Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer, Sue Barclay seized her moment. “How would you restore trust in politics?” the retired teacher from Rushcliffe asked the two leaders, referencing the betting saga and the dismay many people feel about the lack of integrity and honesty in politics. Mr Sunak answered first, saying he shared her anger over political betting. He then repeated his line that anyone found guilty of breaking the law would be “booted out” of his party. And then over to Sir Keir. Talking of the dangers of “self-entitlement”, he contrasted his immediate decision to disown a Labour candidate under investigation for an alleged bet with the reaction of the prime minister, who initially hesitated before taking action. She listened respectfully as Mr Sunak spoke but was filmed smiling and nodding as Sir Keir responded. But the debate made no difference to how Mrs Barclay will vote: the die was cast some time ago. After voting Conservative in Rushcliffe at every election since October 1974 Ms Barclay, 68 on polling day, had already decided to jump to Labour. “A lot of people are fed up with the volatility and instability in the party over the last 14 years,” she tells me as she delivers a pointed critique of the five prime ministers from that period. “Finally Rishi is trying to pick up the pieces. He is earnest. But people are not listening anymore. People have tuned out.” A rare sighting of Tory canvassers in her street persuaded Mrs Barclay that the party was nervous about what was a rock-solid Tory area.  Ruth Edwards, the Tory candidate defending Rushcliffe, turned up on her doorstep to ask whether she could count on Mrs Barclay’s support. “I said for the first time I will vote for Labour. I get Keir Starmer can be a little bit robotic, but he actually has a soul and honesty about him. “Ruth looked a bit deflated. But then my husband popped over and said: ‘It’s all right. I will vote Conservative.’ So that improved her mood a bit.”   But along the tree-lined high street of Radcliffe on Trent, there is evidence that sir Keir Starmer himself is not a vote winner for everyone, including one traditional Labour voter. Sandra Trevillion, a pensioner, says she might switch to the Conservatives. “I need to put my chin to it and make my mind up on how to vote,” she tells me. “I am not enthused by Keir Starmer. He is too cautious. I normally stand out in this area because it is Conservative. But I might vote Conservative, I might vote Liberal. I feel it is a duty to vote. But I am half-hearted about it. I need to look into it a bit more deeply.” Back down to the south coast, and a ladies’ coffee morning is in full flow. All is calm until the BBC wanders into the wood-panelled cafe of the Boscombe Cliff Bowling Club and asks: “Any thoughts about the election?” “I’m confused,” says Pamela Hellicar. “I agree with a bit from every party. “If they can deliver on those bits I will vote for them.” And so a round-table discussion follows, with little affection for the Conservatives but only one clear voice for Labour. “We should have put VAT on private school fees ages ago,” the Labour supporter, who wished to remain anonymous, says of the party’s policy. Others around the coffee table said they thought it unwise for Labour to punish hard-working parents who go without holidays to educate their children privately. “Keir Starmer says he will do better,” says Linda Moorman. “They give all these promises but it is not clear where the money is coming from. They are not clear about taxes. They will probably plunge us into more debt.” Outside the cafe, overlooking the bowling green, there is some better news for Rishi Sunak. Michael Hodge, 75, on a visit from the nearby Mid Dorset and North Poole constituency, will maintain a lifetime habit of voting Conservative, though even he has been impressed by one senior Labour figure. “I like Rachel Reeves. She is very serious. But Keir Starmer changes his opinions and he won’t come off the fence,” Mr Hodge says. Lack of enthusiasm among hitherto stalwart voters is only part of the story behind the challenge facing the Conservatives. Another significant factor is that places like Bournemouth are changing - and so too are their electorates. Hop on a couple of buses across town into the Bournemouth West constituency and you find a very different atmosphere from that in the bowling club. There are wide avenues with grand Victorian and Edwardian villas, and the main street, Wimborne Road, unsurprisingly has a Waitrose. But it also has a younger vibe with artisan-style coffee shops that are popular with students attending one of the town’s two universities. One old Bournemouth hand, speaking anonymously, says that the “studentification” of the town has changed the area. In the past 15 years, they estimate that the vast majority of semi-detached properties running off Wimborne Road in Winton have flipped from being residential to being multi-occupation for students. Darren Lilleker, professor of political communication at Bournemouth University, says: “Young people have moved into this area - we have two universities and a large presence from the creative industries. This has changed the dynamics here. This is no longer a place for the elderly to retire. When I came here 22 years ago Bournemouth was God’s waiting room. It is now very different.” Sheltering under the coffee shop's canopy are Rowan Blackwell-Cronie, 22, and Connor Ariss, 21. Neither would countenance voting Tory. Rowan, a Green supporter, will cast a tactical vote for Labour back home in Gloucester, while Connor will vote Green in Bournemouth West. “I want to vote Green because I like a party that will tax richer people more,” Rowan tells me. “But I will vote Labour. The Conservative Party has clearly rescinded the rights of LGBT people. There has been a lot of fear-mongering.” Connor would have considered a tactical vote for Labour but feels there is now no need: “I would vote tactically if I thought there was a danger of a Conservative government. I don’t see that. I want more Greens in Parliament. I like the Greens’ equalities policies. They are not vague. Labour will backpedal and the Greens won’t. So I want Greens in Parliament to put pressure on a Labour government.” Liv Potter, 21, who is walking with her friend, Liv Dixon, 20, into central Winton  from their student accommodation, has not decided how to vote. She is not impressed by the Labour and Tory campaigns. Ms Potter says: “They are just smearing each other. They should focus on their manifestos and what they believe in. Instead there is this constant flow on social media. They’re just following trends and it isn’t working.” A word of warning from the student heartland of Bournemouth to the energetic teams running the two main parties’ social media accounts. Don’t assume younger voters want their politics trivialised. And in that there is a wider message about this general election. We should be careful about assuming how different age groups and people in particular areas will vote. Liv Potter’s friend, Liv Dixon, says most of her friends are in the army reserve and are inclined to vote Conservative. Every half-generation or so, a general election comes along in which voters yearn for change. This one appears to fall into the category, judging by the mood in normally reliable blue areas. Opponents of the Conservatives will be hoping that an amended version of George Dangerfield’s landmark 1935 book, The Strange Death of Liberal England, will soon be rolling off the presses. Loyal Tories will no doubt hope that such a tome will either be unnecessary or will have a short shelf life. The journalist Geoffrey Wheatcroft published The Strange Death of Tory England in 2005. Within five years the Conservatives were back in power, though initially part of a coalition. Judging by his punchy performances in the debates Rishi Sunak is determined to fight right down to the wire to show that talk of his party’s demise is premature.  Top picture credit: Getty Images.

Volatility,"Mortgage costs to rise for 3 million, says Bank",2024-09-25,2024-06-27,Charlotte Edwards,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crged975jx7o,"About three million households are set to see their mortgage payments rise in the next two years, the Bank of England has said. The Bank's latest Financial Stability Report also said about 400,000 mortgage holders are facing some “very large"" payment increases. Renters also remain under pressure from the higher cost of living and higher interest rates, the report found. However, the Bank said that overall risks to the UK financial system were broadly unchanged, and businesses and households have remained resilient to the impact of higher rates. The Bank found that about one third of mortgage holders in the UK, more than three million, are still paying rates of less than 3%. These will mostly be people who arranged mortgage deals before the Bank of England started to increase interest rates in late 2021. These mortgages are now expiring, and the Bank said the majority of fixed-rate deals will finish before the end of 2026. For the typical household, monthly mortgage repayments are forecast to increase by about £180, or about 28%. However, for around 400,000 households, monthly payments could jump by 50% or more. Despite this, the amount of people struggling to pay their mortgage is still expected to stay below levels seen after the 2008 global financial crisis. ""The overall share of households who are behind in paying their mortgages remains low by historical standards,"" the Bank says. The report comes after three major lenders began reducing mortgage rates this week, following hints of a summer interest rate cut by the Bank of England. HSBC, NatWest and Barclays all cut the cost of fixed-rate home loans for new deals. ""The stark reality is that a lot of people have yet to come off ultra-low rates [and move] on to the higher rates available today. When they do, there is going to be a lot of payment shock,"" said Emma Jones from mortgage broker When The Bank Says No. ""Even though this week has seen major lenders reduce rates across the board, [rates] are still far higher than what many people are paying now. The irony is that the Bank of England has the power to help the very people it is talking about.” The Bank's report found that the proportion of people falling behind on rental payments has risen from 15.7% to 16.5%. This is said to be the result of landlords passing on the cost of higher mortgage interest rates to their tenants.  Higher rents have resulted in ""savings buffers for renters and low-income households"" being further eroded in the six months to the end of March this year. It also said that research suggested that many renters and lower-income households ""intend to run down their savings even further in the next year to deal with the increased cost of living, making these groups less financially resilient"". Overall, the Bank said that UK banks were still in a good position to assist businesses and households. ""The UK banking system has the capacity to support households and businesses, even if economic and financial conditions were to be substantially worse than expected,"" its report said. The Bank highlighted some ""global vulnerabilities"", including political uncertainty in the UK and abroad, that could affect the sector. It said upcoming elections worldwide could ""lead to financial market volatility"". While the Bank said that risks to the UK's financial system were ""broadly unchanged"" since the first three months of the year, prices of assets such as shares and bonds have continued to rise. Investors are ""putting less weight on risks, such as geopolitical developments or continued high inflation"", the report said. It warned that these risks ""make it more likely that there could be a sharp correction in asset prices that could ultimately make it more costly and difficult for UK households and businesses to borrow"".

Volatility,Huge Saudi construction projects 'might get scaled down',2024-09-25,2024-06-23,Sameer Hashmi,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cyrr3mm8evyo,"“They can keep saying that, and we can keep proving them wrong.” That was the response of Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in a TV documentary broadcast in July 2023, while talking about scepticism surrounding Saudi Arabia’s flagship construction projects. Almost a year later, some of the doubts are turning out to be true. In recent months, Saudi Arabia has seemingly scaled back plans for its vast desert development project Neom, which is the centrepiece of Vision 2030. This is the economic diversification programme spearheaded by Prince Mohammed, the Gulf state’s de-facto ruler, to transition the country’s economy away from oil-dependency. As well as Neom, Saudi Arabia is also developing 13 other large construction schemes, or “giga projects” as they are referred, worth trillions of dollars. These include an entertainment city on the outskirts of the capital Riyadh, multiple luxury island resorts on the Red Sea, and a cluster of other tourist and cultural destinations. But low oil prices have impacted government revenues, forcing Riyadh to reassess these projects, and explore new funding strategies. An advisor, who is associated with the government but wished not to be named, tells the BBC that the projects are being reviewed, with a decision expected soon. “The decision will be based on multiple factors,” he says. “But there is no doubt that there will be a recalibration. Some projects will proceed as planned, but some might get delayed or scaled down.” Announced in 2017, Neom is a $500bn (£394bn) plan to build 10 futuristic cities in a desert region in the north west of the country. The most ambitious of them, and the one that has gained all the headlines, is The Line. This will be a linear city consisting of two adjoined, parallel skyscraper walls standing 500m high - taller than the Empire State Building. Yet they will have combined width of just 200m, including the gap between them. The original plan was that they would extend for 170km (105 miles), and become home to nine million inhabitants. But according to people familiar with the details – and as already leaked to the press - the project developers will now focus on completing just 2.4km by 2030, as part of the first module. When The Line was first announced it was billed as a “carbon-free linear city” that would redefine urban living, with amenities for residents like parks, waterfalls, flying taxis, and robot maids. The city would have no roads or cars, and would be made up of interconnected, pedestrianised communities. It would also include an ultra-high-speed train, with a maximum journey duration of 20 minutes anywhere within city limits. How many of these features will be part of the first phase are unclear. Along with The Line, Neom is also due to include an octagon-shaped floating industrial city, and a mountain ski-resort that will host the Asian Winter Games in 2029. Ali Shihabi, a former banker now on Neom's advisory board, says the targets set for projects under Vision 2030 were deliberately “designed to be over ambitious”. “It was meant to be over ambitious, with the clear understanding that only a part of it would be delivered on time. But even that part would be significant,” says Mr Shihabi. The scaling back of Neom has put the spotlight on the funding challenges that the Saudi government is facing. Neom is being paid for by the Saudi government through its sovereign wealth entity, the Public Investment Fund (PIF). The official cost to build Neom, $500bn, is 50% more than the country’s entire federal budget for the year. But analysts estimate that it would ultimately cost more than $2tn to execute the full project. Saudi Arabia’s government budget has been in a deficit since late 2022, when the world’s largest oil exporter began slashing production to accelerate global prices. The government has forecast a deficit of $21bn for this year. The PIF is feeling the pinch. It controls assets of about $900bn, but it had just $15bn in cash reserves as of September. Tim Callen, the former IMF chief to Saudi Arabia and now a visiting fellow at the Arab Gulf States Institute, says that raising capital for Neom and other large-scale projects is a key challenge in the future. “It is going to be increasingly challenging to fund the PIF to the levels that are required for these projects,” Mr Callen says. The Gulf state is tapping other avenues to shore up capital. Earlier this month, it sold roughly $11.2bn worth of shares in its national oil company Saudi Aramco. Most of those proceeds are expected to go to the PIF, which was also the biggest beneficiary when the company went public in 2019. The sale comes amid volatility in oil prices. In July of last year, in an attempt to bolster prices, the Saudi Arabia-led OPEC+ oil producing group of countries curbed production. Riyadh voluntarily cut its supplies by one million barrels a day. However, this month, OPEC+ reversed the decision, and it will gradually start increasing production from October. According to the International Monetary Fund, the price of a barrel of oil needs to be $96.20 for Saudi Arabia to be able to balance its budget. Brent, one of the main benchmarks for crude, has been hovering around $80 a barrel. The country has also relied on selling government bonds to maintain funding flows for the PIF. The other challenge has been that foreign direct investment has remained far below targets, underlining Riyadh’s struggle to attract funding from private companies and international investors. ‘It’s going to be very difficult to persuade investors to come into projects that they view as being overly ambitious,” says Mr Callen. “It’s unclear where your returns will ultimately come from.” The Gulf state is also funnelling money into sectors such as tourism, mining, entertainment, and sports as part of the economic diversification strategy. In recent years, Saudi Arabia has won the hosting rights for several major international events, such as the football Asian Cup in 2027, Asian Winter Games in 2029, and the World Expo 2030. It has also emerged as the sole bidder for the 2034 FIFA Men’s World Cup. All these projects will require massive investments in the years to come. Mr Shihabi expects the government to prioritise these international events as they get closer. “Projects where we have specific deadlines to meet will get prioritized by the nature of things,” he says. In April, at a special meeting of the World Economic Forum meeting held in Riyadh, the country’s Finance Minister Mohammed Al-Jadaan said the government didn’t have an “ego”, and would adjust its Vision 2030 plan to transform its economy as needed. “We will change course, we will extend some of the projects, we will downscale some projects, we will accelerate some projects,” he said.

Volatility,Filton & Bradley Stoke: Why this is one to watch,2024-09-25,2024-06-20,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c044jjn0zr1o,"As the general election inches ever closer, we're taking a look at some of the key battlegrounds here in the West. Filton and Bradley Stoke was created as a constituency in 2010 and has been won by one party only, The Conservatives, and one man, Jack Lopresti. However last year the Tories lost control of South Gloucestershire Council and the seat is a target for a resurgent Labour.  Here are a few things to know about Filton and Bradley Stoke. The constituency is in South Gloucestershire, and part of the greater Bristol conurbation.  As the name suggests, it includes the towns of Filton, famous for its airfield, and Bradley Stoke, built in the late 80s and 1990s. In fact, much of the housing in the constituency was built in the last 20 years, including areas such as Charlton Hayes and Lyde Green, with many more planned over the coming years.  The area is also home to some major employers from the aerospace industry, including Airbus, BAE systems and Rolls Royce, as well as the Cribbs Causeway shopping mall. It's also where the Ministry of Defence's largest UK site is based - at Filton Abbey Wood. Filton is synonymous with the aerospace industry, still a major employer here and a sector that is also very much part of the region's identity.  Rolls Royce and Airbus make vital parts for modern aviation and employ more than 8,000 people between them on their sites. Whilst Concordes are no longer built here, you can still see one at the Aerospace Bristol museum as well as other planes, helicopters and aviation projects built locally.  The businesses were based next to Filton Airfield, which after being sold in 2015 to YTL, is slowly being turned into one of the biggest new housing developments in the region. People in Bradley Stoke know only too well the effect a faltering economy can have on a new development. A lack of town planning and a national recession in the early 90s meant the area was built without proper public amenities, whilst many homeowners suffered negative equity problems, leading to its nickname ""Sadly Broke."" Decades on, and YTL are at the beginning of a development nearby called ""Brabazon"" that it is hoped will eventually consist of 6,500 new homes. Whilst the volatility of the housing market has also been evident in recent times, the plans for Brabazon also include a new concert arena and a new public park. However, with the new homes comes concern over schools, access to a GP, and the effect on local transport. Parents in Lyde Green will finally welcome two new schools in 2026 after years of delays, while a new train station is planned to serve Filton's new concert arena.  Meanwhile, in Filton's traditional residential streets, the proliferation of large town houses being turned into Houses of Multiple Occupancy (HMOs), continues to cause friction between landlords and residents concerned about overcrowding.  With so many large employers in the constituency, the area found itself at the heart of a series of strikes in 2022 and 2023. As inflation rose, concerns over working conditions and pay led to several walk outs. This included Royal Mail staff at their huge sorting office in Patchway, as well as ambulance staff based at the North Bristol operations base in Filton. Unhappy with a lack of recruitment and the growing demands of the job, it led to claims from some that, ""the NHS is broken"". Many of the disputes have since been resolved, although not the one involving junior doctors, which has been a recurring issue during this general election campaign. Southmead Hospital - the region's biggest - is just next to the constituency in neighbouring Bristol North West.  Whilst Filton and Bradley Stoke has only ever elected one person to represent them in Parliament, it is Labour which is targeting the seat and hoping to capitalise on any unhappiness over the state of the economy or the NHS.

Volatility,Housing demand wanes as buyers bank on rate cut,2024-09-25,2024-06-13,Charlotte Edwards,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cmllreerzmro,"House buyers are putting off purchasing a new home until the Bank of England cuts interest rates, evidence suggests.  UK housebuilder Crest Nicholson was forced to issue a profit warning after it said sales momentum had softened since Easter due to volatile mortgage rates as well as buyers now expecting borrowing costs to drop later this year. Meanwhile, a survey of chartered surveyors found that demand for homes had weakened in May. Financial markets are forecasting that the Bank of England could cut interest rates in August or September.  Crest Nicholson reported a pre-tax loss of £30.9m for the six months to the end of April, including the impact of exceptional costs, compared to a £28.4m profit over the same period last year.  The housebuilder said that while ""the spring selling season started well"", it added: ""Momentum has softened slightly since Easter, reflecting the volatility in mortgage rates and the expectation of a base rate reduction coming later in the year than previously expected."" It added: ""The imminent general election is creating some short-term uncertainty, but this is anticipated to be alleviated in July once the outcome is known."" The firm now expects adjusted full-year profits of between £22m to £29m. Analysts had expected the company to announce profits of around £38m. Crest Nicholson's share price tumbled by nearly 12% to 212.4p. A survey by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) found that demand had weakened in May. Tarrant Parsons, senior economist at RICS, said a recent recovery in the housing market ""appears to have slipped into reverse of late"" which he blamed on higher mortgage rates in the past couple of months. However he predicted that this was ""delaying, rather than derailing, a modest improvement going forward"". ""Indeed, respondents continue to envisage a more positive trend in sales activity coming through over the year ahead, although this is likely predicated on the Bank of England being able to start lowering interest rates in the coming months."" Those surveyed by RICS said that demand was weakest in both south east and south west England. In contrast, prices were still robust in Scotland and Northern Ireland."
Volatility,Italy's Meloni basks in G7 limelight with Western leaders,2024-09-25,2024-06-13,Mark Lowen,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c888jmpv2pko,"Two accommodation options for this week’s G7 summit in the southern Italian region of Puglia have been on show: one, a sumptuous resort of bougainvillea-clad villas and private pools, where Madonna and the Beckhams have holidayed, and where the singer Justin Timberlake and actress Jessica Biel got married.  The other, a giant ship moored off the coast of Brindisi, full of water leaks and broken air conditioning units spewing dirt onto bedsheets. The first, the palatial Borgo Egnazia, is housing the leaders of the world’s largest advanced economies, from Joe Biden to Emmanuel Macron, and Rishi Sunak to Justin Trudeau. The second was brought in to accommodate the 2,600 police officers providing security. It was denounced by their unions as having “inhuman” conditions, resembling those of ancient slave ships.  Reported to have cost the Italian government €6m (£5.07m), it’s now been impounded, with a fraud investigation under way.  Two faces of Italy: the sublime and the shoddy. For the Prime Minister, Giorgia Meloni, it’s the gleaming first face that she’ll play up this week, as she hosts world leaders, basking not only in the glorious Italian sun but also in her victory at the European elections last weekend.  Her party - the far-right Brothers of Italy, to some extent softened under her leadership - stormed to a convincing win, making her the only Western European leader strengthened by the vote.  Among the other guests, France’s President Macron was resoundingly defeated by the far-right National Rally, prompting him to call fresh parliamentary elections, while Germany’s Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, handed his Social Democrats their worst-ever European election result, beaten into third place by the far-right AfD. As for the other G7 leaders, Rishi Sunak languishes in the polls before the upcoming UK election, as does Justin Trudeau ahead of his electoral fight in Canada next year; and Joe Biden could be booted out of the White House in November by Donald Trump.  Little wonder that Ms Meloni boasted that Italy was going into this summit with “the strongest government of all”. Who would have imagined that the country whose notorious political volatility has ushered in almost 70 governments since World War Two would now be seen as the stable one as the others lose their footing? That shaky situation in many G7 countries is contributing to low expectations among some observers. “There are two levels to the G7: what’s the big narrative and what are the concrete deliverables – and on both counts, it looks like a very unlucky summit,"" says Natalie Tocci, the director of the Italian Institute for International Affairs.  In comparison, she says, 2021 marked President Biden’s first G7, in which he re-committed to the multilateral order after the turbulent years of Donald Trump; and the last two years have seen a clear sense of solidarity in the West after the invasion of Ukraine. “But now,"" Ms Tocci warns, “if anything will come out of this summit, it’s the fear of a catastrophe playing out before our eyes,” with the urgency of reaching agreements before the possibility of new governments led by Donald Trump in the US and the far-right in France. And what of those summit aims? The most likely to be fulfilled is a plan to loan Ukraine $50bn (€46bn; £39bn) from the interest on frozen Russian assets in the West.  Some parties, like the US, had mooted seizing the Russian assets altogether, thought to be worth around $300bn. But that was strongly opposed by others such as Christine Lagarde, the president of the European Central Bank, who argued it could set a dangerous precedent and potentially violate international law.  The new proposal, with the assets used as collateral for a loan, looks likely to be backed at this summit, giving cash-starved and war-weary Ukraine another vital lifeline. Separate from these plans, Mr Sunak is set to announce up to £242m in support for Ukraine's energy and humanitarian needs. Ahead of travelling to the summit, he said on Wednesday that allies must be ""decisive and creative in our efforts to support Ukraine and end [Russian President Vladimir] Putin’s illegal war at this critical moment"". There will also be sessions on the climate crisis, with participants under pressure to move faster on transitioning to renewable energy; on Africa, as Italy spearheads investment projects there in part to encourage young Africans to stay rather than migrate, often illegally, to Europe; on the Middle East, after the United Nations approved a US-backed plan for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas; and on artificial intelligence, which will be addressed by none other than Pope Francis.  The 87-year-old pontiff has called for global regulation of AI, warning of its danger to ethics and human rights.  It is the first time that a pope will attend a G7 – another boon for Giorgia Meloni. Partly to combat criticism that the G7 permanent members are an exclusive club, an array of other world leaders have been invited, from Brazil to Turkey, and Saudi Arabia to Algeria, with the aim of broadening the global consensus.  It will be the first international summit for Narendra Modi of India and Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa since both lost their majorities in recent elections. And so Italians in this gorgeous coastal region will watch as helicopters fly in and soldiers prowl the streets.  Some, like ice-cream maker Vincenzo Iannacone, are proud of Puglia’s temporary elevation to the centre of the diplomatic world. He’s created seven new flavours in the parlour he’s owned for 57 years: one for each G7 member.  They bear colourful names of regional towns, from Almond of Toritto to Cookie of Messapica, prompting enthusiastic discussion about the summit among his customers, he says.  “I would love the delegations to come by and taste them,"" he tells me. And could he even hope they’d be added to the menu at Borgo Egnazia, the leaders’ resort?  “That would be the highlight of my life,"" he beams. “I don’t think it will happen – but never say never.”"
Volatility,Sunak announces UK general election for 4 July,2024-09-25,2024-05-22,Paul Seddon,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-69050450,"Rishi Sunak has vowed to ""fight for every vote"" as he called an early UK general election for Thursday 4 July. The PM made the announcement in a rain-soaked speech outside 10 Downing Street, as he bids to win a fifth term in office for the Conservatives. The surprise move overturned expectations of an autumn poll, which might have given the Tories a better chance of closing the gap with Labour. Sir Keir Starmer said it was ""time for change"" away from ""Tory chaos"".  Labour has been posting large leads in national opinion polls, and has insisted it has a fully organised campaign ready to go.  Parliament will now be suspended on Friday, before it is formally shut down on Thursday next week ahead of an official five-week election campaign.  It means there are only two days to pass any outstanding legislation - a move which will mean some of the government's measures will have to be abandoned. October or November had previously been thought more likely for an election date. But the rumours started swirling from early on Wednesday morning, after confirmation that annual inflation had fallen to its lowest rate in almost three years.  And as Prime Minister's Questions got under way in the Commons, it still was not clear whether an announcement was coming. It was not until just after 17:00 BST that the UK's first July election since 1945 was confirmed. The prime minister referred to the inflation figures as he announced the election date in Downing Street later in the day, in a sign he hopes to frame his campaign around a narrative of economic recovery after a period of rising living costs.  He added that the fall in inflation, along with the UK's emergence from recession earlier this year, were ""proof that the plan and priorities"" he had set out were working. But his statement did not go entirely to plan, as he battled worsening rain and activists blasting out New Labour anthem Things Can Only Get Better over a loudspeaker.  There was confusion in at least some parts of the Conservative Party about why Mr Sunak had decided to call the election sooner than had been widely expected. ""I just don't understand it,"" one Tory MP told the BBC. ""The economy is improving. Why not give that more time to bed in?"" One senior minister was annoyed that Mr Sunak had given his speech in the driving rain. ""If the whole point was to remind the public that he was Mr Furlough, why not do the speech inside from the same briefing room?"" They added: ""Labour MPs are happy. We're not. That tells a story."" In a TV statement shortly afterwards, Sir Keir argued Tory ""chaos"" had damaged the economy, and a vote for his party represented a chance to bring political stability. Adding it was ""time for change"", he criticised the Conservatives' management of public services, the NHS and record on tackling crime. ""Give the Tories five more years and things will only get worse. Britain deserves better than that,"" Sir Keir added. SNP leader John Swinney, who took over as Scotland's first minister earlier this month, said the election was a chance to ""remove the Tory government and put Scotland first"". Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey said it would be a chance to ""kick Rishi Sunak's appalling Conservative government out of office"", whilst Greens co-leader Carla Denyer said her party was aiming to elect at least four new MPs. And Reform UK leader Richard Tice said the Tories had ""broken Britain"" but Labour would ""bankrupt Britain"", and only his party would offer ""common sense policies that can now save Britain"". Mr Sunak's statement is the start of weeks of general election campaigning for the 650 seats in Parliament. It will be fought on the first set of new constituency boundaries since 2010, redrawn to reflect population changes since then, and will be the first where voters have to show ID. The Royal Family has postponed engagements ""which may appear to divert attention or distract from the election campaign"", Buckingham Palace said, adding that the King and Queen sent their ""sincere apologies"" to those affected. At the last election in 2019, Boris Johnson won an 80-seat majority after calling a snap poll as he fought to get his Brexit withdrawal deal through Parliament. It was followed by an extraordinarily volatile period in British politics, as the country was hit by the Covid pandemic and Mr Johnson was forced to resign, amid a cabinet revolt over a series of scandals. His successor Liz Truss lasted 49 days in the job before she quit, after a market backlash to her tax and spending plans announced at a hastily arranged ""mini Budget"" in September 2022. This is the first general election since 2015 that has not required a vote in Parliament to approve the date, since legislation fixing the time between polls was reversed two years ago."
Volatility,Everything you need to know about Met Gala 2024,2024-09-25,2024-05-06,By Sam Cabral,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68966016,"A-listers have been sashaying down the red carpet for fashion's biggest night out - the Met Gala. Actors, musicians and business magnates are among those dressing to impress at the Metropolitan Museum of Art fundraiser in New York City. The 2024 edition of the black-tie extravaganza is inspired by The Garden of Time, a short story by the British New Wave sci-fi author JG Ballard. The annual gala raises money for the museum's Costume Institute. This year's theme has been chosen to complement the Costume Institute's forthcoming exhibit Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion. The BBC didn't get a ticket either - but here's a quick guide to the event. Those outside of fashion's inner sanctum never get to see the private cocktail and dinner events that comprise this multimillion-dollar fundraiser. But fashion critics everywhere do get to watch their favourite actors, artistes and influencers walk a lengthy red carpet. Guests began arriving at the Met and walking up the iconic New York landmark's grand staircase to the click of a thousand cameras from 18:00 EST (22:00 GMT). But expect late arrivals - we're looking at you, Rihanna. Fashion magazine Vogue, which organises the event, is exclusively livestreaming the red carpet on its website and all of its digital platforms. Streams are also available to US viewers on NBC's Peacock streaming platform and E!. International viewers can tune in via TikTok, YouTube, Instagram and X. You can follow the BBC's live blog for updates. The gala and its explosion in popularity has been overseen by Vogue's global editorial director Anna Wintour. The Met Gala's theme often serves as a prelude to the Costume Institute's spring 2024 exhibition - and this year is no different. The exhibit - Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion - uses technology to ""breathe new life"" into garments from the Met's archives so fragile they can no longer be worn and must remain under glass. Artificial intelligence, computer-generated imagery, X-rays and soundscapes will be used in ""creative and immersive activations designed to convey the smells, sounds, textures, and motions"" of these items, according to the museum's website. The dress code for Monday's red carpet is The Garden of Time, which shares its name with a dystopian tale written in 1962 by JG Ballard, in which the last bastion of the super-rich is overrun by a working-class mob of the ""great unwashed"". Commentators are calling it an exploration of rebirth and renewal, and of humanity's tendency towards cycles of creation and destruction. For an event that celebrates affluence and excess in an age of economic uncertainty and global volatility, the theme may sound a little on the nose. The short answer is no. Fashion's biggest night is a cocktail and dinner party for about 400 to 450 invited guests. Wealthy celebrities and brands snap up all the available tickets and tables at the charity benefit. An individual ticket goes for around $75,000 (£60,000), more than the average down payment on a house. A 10-seat table starts at $350,000. In 1995, Ms Wintour's first year overseeing the event, a ticket cost just $1,000. The gala raised about $22m last year, when its theme paid tribute to late design legend Karl Lagerfeld. Ms Wintour has recruited four big names to serve as co-chairs at this year's event. They are Latino music stars Bad Bunny and Jennifer Lopez, US actress Zendaya and Australian actor Chris Hemsworth, making his debut at the gala.  Co-chairs help promote the event, plan its theme and dinner, and arrive at the beginning of its red carpet portion. Serving as honorary chairs are Shou Zi Chew, chief executive officer of TikTok, and Jonathan Anderson, the creative director of the Loewe's fashion house. TikTok - currently under the threat of a nationwide ban - and Loewe's are also sponsoring the gala and exhibition. The guest list is always top secret, but several celebrities have already confirmed their attendance. Rihanna has said she will be there, and we can expect her to be accompanied by her rapper-partner A$AP Rocky. We can also expect to see J-Lo's significant other, Ben Affleck, as well as Zendaya's man Tom Holland.  Others to look out for include Ayo Edebiri, Dua Lipa, Emma Stone, Lily Gladstone, Lady Gaga, Kim Kardashian, Kylie Jenner, Kate Moss, Blake Lively, Lil Nas X and Lea Michele. Power couple Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are not tipped to attend. Neither is Jared Leto, who often stands out among the male attendees. Speculation is also rife over the likelihood of appearances by Sean ""Diddy"" Combs, who is facing multiple sexual misconduct lawsuits, and Kendrick Lamar, who is locked in a heated war of words with rival rapper Drake."
Volatility,The 'delicious irony' of the 2024 Met Gala theme,2024-09-25,2024-05-05,Rosalind Jana,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20240503-the-delicious-irony-of-the-met-galas-garden-of-time-theme,"In JG Ballard's dystopian story The Garden of Time – which has inspired this year's dress code – the super-rich hide themselves in Arcadian splendour while the ""great unwashed"" riot. It seems an unlikely choice of theme for fashion's event of the year. The title of JG Ballard's 1962 short story The Garden of Time has an elegiac romanticism to it. Images immediately stir, visions of flowers and vines springing forth. Depending on the bent of your imagination, those visions may err towards tidy blooms or overgrown thickets, perpetual splendour or the endless cycles of death and growth so necessary for even the smallest pocket of paradise. After all, a garden is time incarnate, bound by the slow march of the seasons. But what kind of garden is this? Do the normal rules of chronology apply? This year, fashion's annual extravaganza the Met Gala has taken Ballard's title as its dress code. The theme has been chosen to complement The Costume Institute's exhibition Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion, an exploration of the many items held within the Met's archives that are now too fragile to be worn. Reanimated using technologies including X-rays, AI and soundscapes, these artefacts are interspersed with iconography related to the natural world, the combination promising to ""serve as a metaphor for the fragility and ephemerality of fashion and a vehicle to examine the cyclical themes of rebirth and renewal."" It's an odd pairing. Perhaps asking the Gala's attendees to embark on further reading before they attend is setting them up to fail (see the various interpretations of ""camp"" in 2019 that would have had Susan Sontag smashing her Tiffany lamps in protest), but for anyone who does choose to dig deeper, the choice of Ballard's short story may prove puzzling. It relays the tale of Count Axel and his Countess wife who live in a magnificent hilltop villa, surrounded by their gardens. These gardens, where ""the air seemed brighter, the sun seemed warmer"" hold a series of ""time flowers"" – translucent growths with crystal hearts. When plucked, that crystal core dissolves, emitting the light trapped within. ""Strange shifts momentarily transformed the evening, subtly altering its dimensions of time and space,"" Ballard writes. ""The darkened portico of the house, its patina of age stripped away, loomed with a curious spectral whiteness as if suddenly remembered in a dream."" The flowers can slow the clock, but they cannot stop it. So far, so fitting for an exhibition concerned with historical clothing that embodies time without being immune to it. After all, garments are vulnerable, affected by heat, sweat, pressure, stains, moths, storage methods and so on. The job of the archivist is to attempt as much preservation as possible, suspending the usual process of decay even if it cannot be staunched entirely – conserving history so that future generations can maintain some connection with the products of the past. However, Count Axel is not picking his precious flowers for the thrill of it. On the horizon, an army advances, ""a vast confused throng of people, men and women, interspersed with a few soldiers in ragged uniforms, pressing forward in a disorganised tide"". While the Countess plays Mozart on her harpsichord, and the Count tends to his library, this crowd draws ever closer, threatening destruction on their arrival. Each flower delays the inevitable, pushing the crowd back slightly. But there are only so many flowers, and no more are growing. The villa's days are numbered, husband and wife living in an exquisite glass prison. To briefly spoil the ending, when the mob finally reaches the edge of the gardens, they find only crumbling relics: the lawns overrun with weeds, the house full of rotting doors and caved-in floors. On the terrace there stand two statues protected by belladonna-laced thorn bushes. The stone woman clutches a rose; an Ovidian vision of protected permanence sprung forth from the land, saved from the ravages of time. Commentators writing breezy accounts of this year's costume theme have focused on the metaphorical significance of Ballard's story, pointing to its exploration of humanity's tendency towards cycles of creation and destruction (the fact that one of the top-ranked explainers on Google from 2016 uses that exact wording is, I'm sure, complete coincidence.) Although this holds some truth, it does seem to deliberately ignore a more obvious point. This is a short story in which the last bastion of rich, refined beauty – with its classical music, rare books, and its lovely clothing – is overrun by a working-class mob. ""Some laboured under heavy loads suspended from crude yokes around their necks; others struggled with cumbersome wooden carts, their hands wrenching at the wheel spokes,"" Ballard writes.  The mob is variously described as a tide, a nightmare, and a minor detail from a Goya painting. More like this: It's a jarring image in the context of an event that is a celebration of affluence, excess and rarefied beauty, where a table for the evening sells for $300,000, and an invite bestows an exclusive glitter of Vogue-approved importance on the attendee; perhaps acutely so, when set against the backdrop of global volatility and economic uncertainty, the divisions between safety and danger, wealth and poverty feeling ever starker. Under those circumstances, what on Earth are we to make of this theme based on a story that, regardless of where its loyalties lie, features the destruction of high culture by an undifferentiated mass of humanity? In its evocation of beauty on the brink of ruin, who does it disdain? Any discussion of wealth and exclusivity in the context of the Met Gala is a little plus ça change. Events like this have always been for the privileged few. Similarly, given the consistency of world inequality, contrasting celebrities parading in expensive gowns with images of abject poverty is nothing new (and it is worth pointing out that these expensive gowns do generate a lot of jobs). That said, it is rare to have a dress code that manages to touch on that inequality quite so explicitly before immediately burying it again beneath predictions of attendees wearing ""melancholic florals"". Those contrasting images often rub shoulders in an age where they might pop up one after the other on an Instagram story: the same tools that have made the Met Gala so phenomenally popular also enhance our proximity to suffering the world over. In 2023, the Met Gala generated 12.3 billion impressions for Vogue's channels under the hashtag #metgala, while the event's livestream generated 53 million views across Vogue's various social platforms and global markets. We live in an age of visual saturation, where tragedy and beautiful distractions crowd in on all sides, clamouring for our attention. The Gala itself has been around since 1948, when fashion publicist Eleanor Lambert (a busy woman who was also responsible for the inception of New York Fashion Week) put on a midnight fundraising dinner costing $50 a head. In the 1970s, shrewd Vogue editor-in-chief Diana Vreeland introduced costume themes, cementing the event as a crucial part of the socialite calendar, and ensuring a steady stream of funding for the Costume Institute. However, although it's gone from strength to strength under Anna Wintour's gaze, it's really only been in the past decade or so that the Met Gala has played a pivotal role in popularising the idea of fashion as mass entertainment – aided, of course, by enormous advances in social media. It has become the red carpet to end all red carpets, a chance for the whole world not invited to the costume party to enjoy judging its attendees on how gorgeous, inventive and fitting (in all senses of the word) their outfits are. And just with other forms of mass entertainment, it is both extremely enjoyableand extraordinarily lucrative. According to LaunchMetrics, last year the Gala accrued nearly $1 billion in media-impact value for the various brands involved – and a nice packet of publicity for everyone in attendance. It would be interesting to know how the Ballard short story first came to the table. Was it just a neat title? Or is someone in the committee's midst trying to foment class rebellion? Perhaps the dystopian premise is part of a fiendish plan to get people talking – after all, no publicity is bad publicity for the Met Gala. It welcomes controversy, whether it's Kim Kardashian wearing Marilyn Monroe’s famous ""Happy Birthday, Mr President"" dress or Doja Cat attending dressed as Karl Lagerfeld's beloved cat Choupette, speaking only in meows. This may be too generous a reading though, given that the fashion world loves a reference shorn of complexity. There are some interesting parallels with the 1927 silent film Metropolis, another fashion favourite that has inspired designers including Thierry Mugler, which features a paradisical garden quite literally built above the working masses. At the very least, we can hope that Iris van Herpen brings a thoughtful interpretation.    Whatever the reasoning, there's a certain, delicious irony found in invoking Ballard at the Met Gala. The Garden of Time belongs to the earlier, most science fiction-oriented part of his career, which sprawled in all sorts of directions over the decades but retained a consistently bleak interest in the apocalyptic atmosphere of modernity and its uncertain future: frequently invoking urban hellscapes, wide-scale global destruction, mass media, the cult of celebrity, the thin line between spectacle and violence, and identities configured through consumerism.   In an essay written for Vogue in the 1970s, he even predicted the rise of social media: ""Every one of our actions during the day, across the entire spectrum of domestic life, will be instantly recorded on video-tape. In the evening we will sit back to scan the rushes, selected by a computer trained to pick out only our best profiles, our wittiest dialogue, our most affecting expressions filmed through the kindest filters, and then stitch these together into a heightened re-enactment of the day."" One wonders what he would have made of his own work being amplified and distorted in such a context, his words becoming the backdrop to a fluttering cornucopia of florals, each outfit paraded on the first Monday in May a blooming display of finery hiding a complex network of roots – sponsorship deals, brand calculations, dedicated craftsmanship, exposure opportunities – beneath its pretty skirts. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

Volatility,Irish government runs €8.3bn budget surplus,2024-09-25,2024-04-19,John Campbell,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cv2dqll2nn0o,"The Irish government ran a budget surplus of €8.3bn (£7.1bn) last year, equivalent to just under 3% of national income. It took in tax and other revenues of €123.7bn (£106bn) and spent €115.4bn (£99bn), according to the Central Statistics Office. It is the second year in a row the Republic of Ireland has been able to run a surplus. This is mainly due to a windfall of revenues from corporation tax. Finance Minister Michael McGrath said the surplus ""gives us options that are not open to many peer countries in the developed world"". The government has begun the process of setting up a sovereign wealth fund using some of the tax windfall. The aim is to establish a fund with assets of €100bn (£86bn) by the middle of the 2030s. Partial reforms to global tax regulation have had the unintended consequence of large US companies paying tax on much of their global profits in Ireland. This has seen corporation tax receipts in Ireland balloon from just over €4bn (£3.4bn) in 2014, to just under €24bn (£20.5bn) last year. However, the expectation is that at least some of this revenue is transitory, so it cannot be relied upon to fund permanent spending increases or tax cuts. Mr McGrath said: ""While our headline position is strong, this can change quickly given the inherent volatility in our corporation tax receipts and the dependence we have on revenues from a small number of multinational companies."""
Volatility,Sunak 'believes in lower taxes' despite April rise,2024-09-25,2022-02-23,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60498425,"Chancellor Rishi Sunak has pledged to ""deliver a low tax, higher growth economy"" amid criticism from MPs over rises to National Insurance. Mr Sunak told an audience at the Bayes Business School on Thursday that he would cut taxes ""sustainably"". It comes as National Insurance rates are set to rise from 1 April to help fund health and social care. The rise means employees, employers and the self-employed will all pay 1.25p more in the pound. ""I am going to deliver a lower tax economy but I am going to do so in a responsible way, and in a way that tackles our long term challenges,"" Mr Sunak said in his speech. ""I firmly believe in lower taxes."" However, the chancellor also argued that taxes should not be cut if spending plans are unfunded. Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said the Conservative Party was ""now the party of high tax"". ""The chancellor may say he 'believes' in low taxes in his lecture - but the hard facts are that Sunak has hit households and business with 15 tax rises in two years in post - with an unfair National Insurance rise down the line,"" Ms Reeves said. ""He has raised the most tax on average per budget than any chancellor in the last 50 years."" Labour Party leader Sir Keir Starmer was set to deliver a speech in Huddersfield outlining his party's approach to taxation and ending insecure employment, but it was cancelled due to the Ukraine crisis. Sir Keir had planned to say that a Labour government would end the ""economic fatalism"" of the Conservatives and build ""a new economy of security, where stable employment will be the bedrock of a better future for the next generation"". Mr Sunak said he was ""disheartened when I hear the flippant claim that 'tax cuts always pay for themselves'"". ""They do not,"" he added. ""Cutting tax sustainably requires hard work, prioritisation, and the willingness to make difficult and often unpopular arguments elsewhere."" In Mr Sunak's two years in his role he has overseen hundreds of billions in Covid-related government spending through furlough payments, business grants and testing.  He has also been at the helm as taxation as a share of the economy has risen to its highest level since the 1950s. Under the government's plans, employees, employers and the self-employed will all pay 1.25p more in the pound for National Insurance from April for a year. After that, the extra tax will be collected as a new Health and Social Care Levy. The changes will see an employee on £20,000 a year pay an extra £89 in tax, while someone on £50,000 will pay £464 more. The Liberal Democrats and some backbench Tory MPs have called for the chancellor to scrap the incoming NI hike to ease the financial burden on households and businesses at a time of rising costs. In the speech Mr Sunak also set out his priorities to increase the UK's economic growth, and argued that ""what government does is far less important than creating the conditions for private businesses and individuals to thrive"". Tony Danker, director general of the business group the CBI, said setting out how firms could ""achieve sustainable growth for the long term"" was ""vital"" at a period of volatility in the economy.  ""Government enabling firms to invest, thrive and deliver prosperity is absolutely the right direction of travel,"" he added. Mr Danker has called for a permanent ""super-deduction"" tax break to boost business investment in the UK. The super-deduction allowance currently gives businesses investing in certain types of equipment, like machinery, a much higher tax reduction than usual but will expire in March next year."
Volatility,UK forecast to have slowest growth in G7 next year,2024-09-25,2022-04-19,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-61142906,"The war in Ukraine will ""severely set back"" the global economic recovery with the UK hit harder than most, the International Monetary Fund has said.  The conflict is driving up prices for food and fuel which the international body expects to slow growth globally. It has cut its global forecast and also downgraded its outlook for the UK. This means the UK will no longer be the fastest growing economy in the G7 group of leading Western nations, and will be the slowest in 2023, it says. The body says that UK growth will slow as price pressures lead households to cut spending, while rising interest rates are expected to ""cool investment"". The UK's economy is now predicted to grow by 3.7% this year, down from the previous forecast of 4.7% made in January. However, next year, the UK is expected to have the slowest growth in the G7 and across Europe's main economies, at just 1.2%, a near halving from the 2.3% expected previously. The 2023 UK figure is the slowest apart from heavily-sanctioned Russia in the wider G20 grouping, which includes nations such as China and India. The IMF said that the UK was the fastest growing G7 economy in 2021, and is forecast to be the second fastest in 2022. The low UK growth rates forecast in 2023 are in part due to the UK rebounding more quickly from the pandemic than some of its G7 peers. However, the UK is also wrestling with high inflation, which will hit growth in 2023, as people cut spending as their real income shrinks, the IMF said. The organisation expects inflation to peak in late 2022 at 9%. It said rising interest rates will also slow the UK economy in 2023 and 2023, while government policies such as getting rid of certain tax breaks will reduce business investment at that time. In addition, Brexit will hold back export growth, the IMF said, and it will continue to make pandemic-related labour supply ""scarring"" worse by reducing immigration. ""However, the impact of Brexit is spread over several years and is not the primary driver of the slowdown in 2023,"" a spokesperson for the organisation added. The IMF works with its 189 member countries to try to stabilise the global economy, including issuing short-term loans and assistance to countries who are struggling. It said inflation was now a ""clear and present danger"" in many countries and the situation has added to supply strains from the coronavirus pandemic. ""In the matter of a few weeks, the world has yet again experienced a major, transformative shock,"" IMF director of research Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas wrote in the organisation's 2022 World Economic Outlook. ""Just as a durable recovery from the pandemic-induced global economic collapse appeared in sight, the war has created the very real prospect that a large part of the recent gains will be erased.""  The organisation said it expected global growth of just 3.6% this year, down nearly a percentage point from its forecast before the war.  The World Bank also said it was lowering its growth forecast from 4.1% to 3.2%.  The conflict has already devastated the economies of Ukraine and Russia, which the West cut off from key trade and financial networks with sanctions following the invasion. Ukraine is facing a severe contraction of 35% or more this year, while Russia's economy is expected to shrink by 8.5%, the IMF said. But with Russia a major energy producer and key supplier of staples such as wheat and corn alongside Ukraine, the consequences will ripple far beyond their borders, the IMF warned. There have been two acute shocks to the world economy in quick succession - the pandemic and the Ukraine war. The latter is building on the problems created by the former, tripping up what had been a healthy recovery, and sending prices rising at an even faster rate. Food and energy prices were already being hiked by the supply bottlenecks after the pandemic, before one of the world's biggest energy suppliers invaded one of the world's biggest food exporter. But now there are new bottlenecks emerging from the stringent Covid lockdowns in some regions of China. Rising prices risk social stability in poorer countries, dependent on food imports. Fears about inflation becoming entrenched are leading the world's central bankers to raise interest rates. In turn that is raising the cost of borrowing for the record debts many nations racked up during the pandemic. So all this requires some skill and cooperation among the old and new financial powerhouses of the world. But that has been another commodity in short supply in recent times. ""The economic effects of the war are spreading far and wide - like seismic waves that emanate from the epicenter of an earthquake,"" it said. In Germany, where the economy is especially closely entwined, the war is likely to lower growth by 1.7 percentage points, it said. Even in countries with little direct trade with Russia and Ukraine, households will feel the effects of the war, as central banks respond to the more rapid inflation by raising interest rates, making borrowing more expensive, the IMF said. In the US, for example, the organisation lowered its forecast for growth in 2022 by 0.3 percentage points to 3.7%, citing the prospect of more aggressive interest rate rises.  Overall, inflation pressures are significantly worse than they were when the IMF issued its previous forecast in January. It now predicts inflation in ""advanced economies"" will hit 5.7% this year, while it is likely to reach 8.7% in emerging markets.  UK inflation is expected to be 5.3% next year - the highest in the G7, and higher than all EU members, and only exceeded in the G20 by crisis-ridden Argentina, Turkey and Russia. ""Inflation has become a clear and present danger for many countries,"" Mr Gourinchas wrote in a blog. A few countries, such as oil exporters, are benefiting. The IMF expects growth in Saudi Arabia, for example, to be stronger than it did in January. But the risks are not purely economic, the IMF added.  It said the war had also created a refugee crisis and aggravated political tensions, risking a ""more permanent fragmentation of the world economy into geopolitical blocks with distinct technology standards, cross-border payment systems, and reserve currencies"".  ""Such a 'tectonic shift' would cause long-run efficiency losses, increase volatility and represent a major challenge to the rules-based framework that has governed international and economic relations for the last 75 years,"" the IMF said. A Treasury spokesperson said the IMF forecasts ""will be concerning for many people and families"" in the UK. ""However the support we provided over the past two years has put our economy in a good position to deal with these headwinds, including through record numbers of employees on payrolls and a strong economic recovery from the pandemic,"" the spokesperson said. Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said the IMF forecast ""shows the extreme challenges facing the UK economy"". ""While it is true that global forces play a role, the fact that the UK is forecast to have the slowest growth of any G7 economy next year plus the highest inflation, shows the uniquely bad situation the UK is in. ""Inflation spiralling out of control this year has created a cost of living crisis hitting families across the country, needing decisive and urgent action,"" she said, repeating Labour calls for a windfall tax on oil and gas firms. Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Christine Jardine said the UK government had ""failed to shield the UK from spiralling energy bills and soaring inflation, but they have gone ahead with raising people's taxes to their highest point in 70 years""."
Volatility,Transport firms feeling pinch of rising fuel costs,2024-09-25,2022-03-07,By Niall Glynn,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-60650159,"The conflict in Ukraine continues to affect the cost of oil and gas, putting a further squeeze on the cost of living.  World oil prices have jumped to $139 (£106) a barrel, the highest level for almost 14 years. The Northern Ireland Consumer Council has found 500 litres of home heating oil costs £559.50 - an increase of 75% since 23 February. And petrol and diesel prices continue to soar. Petrol prices of £1.65 per litre have been reported in parts of Northern Ireland, with diesel prices close to £1.80 per litre some places. Those compare to around the £1.20 per litre mark a year ago, and prices are unlikely to fall any time soon. The owner of a County Fermanagh fuel company is predicting that diesel prices could hit £2 per litre by the end of this week.  Garry Jennings, from Jennings Fuels and Lubricants in Kesh, said as well as volatility in oil market, there are issues with supplies coming into Northern Ireland.  ""We are selling the fuel we've bought in on Friday, tonight it looks like there's going to be another 10p on oil and that's going to come to us tomorrow morning.  ""We buy on the day and try and sell on the day so this is fuel we bought in on Friday, tomorrow's fuel is going to be 10p up, what's going to happen Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday?""  The Northern Ireland Oil Federation (NIOF) have said there is no issue with supplies, but they are dealing with a 10-day backlog of orders due to mass panic-buying. While some drivers may be able to travel less or use public transport, that is not an option for transport companies. Stephen Anton, from taxi company Fonacab, said rising fuel prices are felt directly by taxi drivers as they are self employed and account for all of their income and costs individually. ""In other words, they fuel their vehicles, the cost of doing so an expense against their booking income,"" Mr Anton said.  ""While drivers can offset fuel costs against their taxable income, the increased fuel costs affect what they take home on a day-to-day basis."" He added: ""If this continues to be a problem, it has the potential to impact negatively on taxi driver numbers across Northern Ireland.  ""Many drivers left the industry for various reasons during Covid and a substantial number have not returned, instead taking early retirement or remaining in other jobs they secured during lockdowns.  ""A sustained high fuel cost may encourage some other drivers to do the same."" Mr Anton said the company was conscious that customers are feeling cost of living increases in their pockets too and did not want to increase fares unnecessarily.  ""There is a balancing act to ensuring that prices remain competitive and affordable for our customers and are also sufficient to allow drivers to make a living and work to provide the services that customers need,"" he said.  ""The current fuel price increases make this a more difficult exercise than ever. ""From our perspective, anything that can be done to reduce fuel costs for drivers' vehicles is a priority.  ""A temporary decrease in fuel duty would be welcome, and there are other tools that local government can employ to reduce overall costs for drivers - for example, reducing the cost of an annual PSV for a taxi to that of an MoT.""  Paul Stewart, from courier firm NI Parcels, said fuel prices had been increasing ""slowly but surely"" over the last year. ""However, in the last six weeks the increases have been huge,"" he said.  ""It has been the largest increase I have ever seen in our business.  ""We have been absorbing some of the increases ourselves, but there is only so much you can absorb, so this has now resulted in some of the increased costs onto our customers.  ""As the fuel prices change so regularly, it is difficult to keep changing your prices and this could make our business look unprofessional. ""It is a very difficult time to absorb the costs or increase prices, we have done a blend of both for now.""   Mr Stewart said the full costs have not been passed onto customers, meaning a reduction in profits for the company.  ""The main issue is the constant price changes making it difficult to set prices, some form of price freeze or price caps would be hugely appreciated,"" he said. ""As the fuel price increases so does the revenue collected on the duty on the increased prices. Duty on fuel could be reduced to help with these increases."" "
Volatility,Keir Starmer claims fact-checked,2024-09-25,2022-09-28,By Reality Check team,https://www.bbc.com/news/63051962,"Sir Keir Starmer has been setting out his vision for a future Labour government, following his speech to his party conference in Liverpool. The Labour leader has criticised the Conservative government's handling of the economy and announced plans for what his party would do in power. We've looked into some of his claims from the speech and his broadcast interviews.  Sir Keir used the £170bn figure on BBC Radio 4's Today programme when explaining how Labour would bring in a bigger windfall tax.  We asked Labour where it came from and they pointed us to a Bloomberg article from August. The article said the £170bn came from an unpublished estimate made by the Treasury of how much the UK's energy producers could make over the next two years. We asked the Treasury whether the figure was correct and it said it did not recognise Bloomberg's analysis. It pointed us to the £5bn a year it expects to raise from the existing windfall tax on companies extracting UK oil and gas. The latest figures from the North Sea Transition Authority show companies made around £21bn in profits from extracting oil and gas in the North Sea in 2021. That was, of course, before the energy shock caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine which has led to energy producers making bigger profits as the price of gas has gone up.  But there's considerable uncertainty over whether you could get to £170bn over the next two years - even if you factor in excess profits - especially given the volatility of gas prices. In his speech, the Labour leader said the government had failed to prepare for the cost-of-living crisis, which he acknowledged had been sparked by the Ukraine conflict.  The Conservatives did scrap the Green Homes Grant - a scheme to insulate 600,000 homes in England - last year. It had reached just 10% of the target figure.  Money is now being targeted at lower-income households, but the Conservatives' record on insulation has been criticised as ""too slow"" by the Climate Change Committee. The UK has some of the worst-insulated homes in Europe. On nuclear energy, in the 12 years of Conservative (and Conservative-led) government, work has started on one new nuclear plant - at Hinkley Point C, which is due to open in 2027. In July 2022, then Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced another one would be built at Sizewell C.  But no new nuclear plants were built in 13 years of Labour government (1997-2010) - although then Prime Minister Gordon Brown did approve sites for new nuclear in 2009.  Sir Keir was making his case for a publicly owned renewable energy company he would set up - Great British Energy.   The onshore wind farm he referred to is Pen-y-Cymoedd in South Wales. It was set up in 2014 following a £220m investment by Swedish company Vatenfall and became operational in 2017. While the company which operates the site is based in the UK, the ultimate parent company is Sweden's state-owned Vattenfall.  Pen-y-Cymoedd has a total of 76 wind turbines and provides energy to 15% of all households in Wales.  The Labour leader claimed that - under the Conservatives - the UK experienced the worst decade of growth for 200 years. We asked Labour for the evidence for this claim, but they haven't told us yet. We don't know whether the ""worst decade"" they are highlighting is the 10-year period from 2010-2019 or from 2011-2020. Growth between 2011 and 2020 was certainly weak, ending with the Covid pandemic, which shut down large parts of the economy. But looking at the Bank of England's long-term growth figures, the decade from 1911 to 1920 was even worse, ending with the huge post-World War One downturn. The economy grew by 5.5% over the whole of that decade, compared with 7.6% for 2011 to 2020. If you look at 2010 to 2019 - the growth rate was 21.0%. The worst 10-year period in the last 200 years was 1917-26, when the economy shrank 9.5%. Trade union umbrella body the TUC did some research looking at the 10 years after a recession, which found that 2009 to 2019 had been the worst post-recession decade since 1808-1818. Keir Starmer was talking about the tax cuts announced in the Conservative government's mini-budget on Friday. They included reversing the rise in National Insurance next month and cutting the basic rate of income tax and scrapping its top rate next year.   The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), a leading economic research group, says tens of millions of people will be affected. But IFS Director Paul Johnson said only those with incomes over £155,000 will be net beneficiaries of the tax cuts, when all other tax measures - over the course of the whole Parliament up to 2025 - are taken into account.  He pointed out that the thresholds for the personal allowance and higher income tax rate will be frozen until the end of this Parliament.  And he said this means, with inflation now so high, that the freezes represent big effective income tax rises.  Read more from Reality Check Send us your questions"

Volatility,More on-island power 'may be needed this winter',2024-09-25,2022-10-10,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-guernsey-63197882,"Guernsey Electricity has said it may need to generate more power than usual on the island this winter due to pressures on supply in Europe. It could mean on-island diesel generators in the Vale working harder during the next few months. Guernsey currently imports more than 90% of its electricity. The boss of Guernsey Electricity said its deal with French power firm EDF meant customers were protected from huge cost increases seen elsewhere. Alan Bates, chief executive officer at Guernsey Electricity, said: ""The current concerns over security of supply for this winter and the resulting volatility in prices is, to an extent, caused by the electricity generation capacity issues in Europe.  ""We continue to work with Electricité de France (EDF) to manage our island demand and this includes options to assist in managing these issues."" He added: ""This winter we may need to generate more electricity to support Europe in ensuring demand is balanced to the supply available."" Mr Bates said the contract with EDF ""continues to insulate local consumers, through our price fixing strategy, from the huge increases in costs seen in the UK and elsewhere"".  He said: ""The current level of volatility will eventually start to affect prices; however, we have no plans to change tariffs this winter due to the commodity market.""

Volatility,Bitcoin buster? The search for a more stable cryptocurrency,2024-09-25,2018-08-20,By Matthew Wall,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45245149,"Cryptocurrencies - digital tokens known as cryptos for short - have investors in the grip of a gold rush fever, with billions being traded every day. Prices fluctuate wildly, making them high-risk investments. But could a more stable, less volatile crypto persuade us to think of digital money less as a speculative investment and more as a mainstream ""smart"" currency? There are now more than 1,500 cryptos - Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, Litecoin to name just a few - being traded on about 190 exchanges around the world.  Prices have soared and crashed alarmingly. In 2017 the price of a bitcoin rocketed to nearly £15,000 before losing two-thirds of its value in just a few months. It's currently worth about £5,000. This volatility may be a speculative trader's friend, but it has reinforced cryptos' reputation for being high-risk investments for the adrenalin-fuelled ""get rich quick"" brigade.  Crypto fundraising schemes, known as Initial Coin Offerings, have alarmed regulators around the world. So a growing number of crypto start-ups are developing alternatives known as stablecoins, digital tokens pegged to traditional fiat currencies such as the US dollar, British pound or Japanese yen, with the aim of reducing this volatility and increasing confidence. Hong Kong-based Tether has blazed a trail in this market, swapping about $2.7bn (£2.1bn) worth of fiat currency into its eponymous digital tokens. It claims to have all its digital tethers backed by traditional money in its bank accounts - a claim that has been disputed by some. But Tether's 90% dominance of the stablecoin market is enticing several others to try something similar.  For example, crypto finance company Circle is launching a new token called USD Coin. ""Imagine a US dollar coin that you can make payments with, use on crypto networks, or use in smart contracts to pay dividends, but which you can convert back to fiat currency at any time,"" explains Circle chief executive Jeremy Allaire. Circle's USD Coin will run on the Ethereum blockchain - the distributed ledger technology underlying cryptos - and have an open standard infrastructure overseen by a body called Centre. It wants Centre to become the main platform for other stablecoin operators.  ""Crypto represents the next layer of infrastructure for the internet,"" he says. ""It will allow money to move at the speed of light around the world for free, but also offer binding, verifiable contracts, enabling anyone to do business together. ""We're going to see a lot of businesses using tokens for revenue raising. And eventually central banks will want to do this,"" maintains Mr Allaire. Circle, which is backed by the likes of Goldman Sachs and Baidu and has an estimated value of close to $3bn, recently attracted another $110m in investment led by investors such as Chinese crypto mining giant Bitmain.  Kory Hoang is the founder of Stably, a firm in Vancouver that is developing StableUSD, another US dollar-backed stablecoin. The Vietnam-born entrepreneur believes the sector presents ""a huge opportunity"", especially for people in countries with unstable currencies. ""Fruit sellers on the streets in Zimbabwe could accept your digital payment via an app,"" he says. ""Their fiat money is almost worthless, but they could receive tokens in seconds and sell them very easily for a small commission."" Obi Nwosu, founder and chief executive of Coinfloor, a crypto exchange collective, says: ""There are about two billion people who are unbanked or underbanked, which means they have no access to the world of e-commerce.  ""Bitcoin and cryptos give these people access at much lower cost, but admittedly with less protection."" But there is disagreement within the industry about the best way to reduce the price volatility of cryptos. Coinfloor hopes to solve the volatility issue by attracting far more money into the sector in the belief that greater trading volumes will lead to a more efficient market.   This will require better regulation, argues Mr Nwosu, before large institutions are likely to commit serious money. Concerns about the abuse of cryptos for money laundering and terrorist financing remain a barrier to mass acceptance, he says. But this is still better than going down the stablecoin route, he believes, which requires a central organisation to back the digital tokens, with the extra cost this entails. And this structure conflicts with the decentralised nature of cryptos and blockchain technology and could be ""the worst of both worlds"", he says. ""We think that although stablecoins could be popular in the short run, a decentralised currency that is stable and doesn't have a central organisation behind it will be safer in the long run."" Whatever the disagreements about how to achieve price stability for currency and investment purposes, most people in the sector agree that a crypto's additional ability to act as a smart contract presents huge opportunities to ""tokenise"" physical assets. ""Say I have a house in downtown Saigon worth $1m,"" says Mr Hoang. ""I could tokenise it and sell those tokens on the global crypto market. You could issue a billion pieces of your house if you wanted. Then people would start trading them, just like shares in a real estate investment trust. ""It gives investors around the world access to investment opportunities they never had before."" Akbar Thobani, chief executive of crypto trading platform SFOX, says: ""We think that tokenising assets, such as trucks, cars, planes and real estate, will become big business.""  But if stablecoin cryptos do become as mainstream as fiat currencies, will the system be able to cope with the volume?  Many fear blockchain is getting slower and in danger of seizing up altogether. Ethereum, one of the most popular blockchain platforms, is only able to process about 13 transactions a second, whereas card payment processing platform Visa can cope with more than 20,000 transactions a second.   This is why work is afoot to create more flexible blockchain-based platforms, such as EOS and Stellar, that could cope with a vast increase in transaction volume and millions more users."
Volatility,Cream drummer Ginger Baker dies aged 80,2024-09-25,2019-10-06,By Mark Savage,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-49827436,"Ginger Baker, one of the most innovative and influential drummers in rock music, has died at the age of 80. A co-founder of Cream, he also played with Blind Faith, Hawkwind and Fela Kuti in a long and varied career. His style combined the lyricism of jazz with the crude power of rock. One critic said watching him was like witnessing ""a human combine harvester"". But he was also a temperamental and argumentative figure, whose behaviour frequently led to on-stage punch-ups. Nicknamed Ginger for his flaming red hair, the musician was born Peter Edward Baker in Lewisham, south London, shortly before World War Two. His bricklayer father was killed in action in 1943, and he was brought up in near poverty by his mother, step-father and aunt.  A troubled student, he joined a local gang in his teens and became involved in petty theft. When he tried to quit, gang-members attacked him with a razor. His early ambition was to ride in the Tour de France but he was forced to quit the sport when, aged 16, his bicycle got ""caught up"" with a taxi. Instead, he took up drumming.  ""I was always banging on the desks at school,"" he recalled. ""So all the kids kept saying, 'Go on, go and play the drums', and I just sat down and I could play. ""It's a gift from God. You've either got it or you haven't. And I've got it: time. Natural time."" The strong legs he'd developed on long bike rides helped him play the double bass drum set-up he favoured and Baker soon talked his way into his first gig. He played with jazz acts like Terry Lightfoot and Acker Bilk but his style - fragmented and aggressive, but articulate and insistent - was often an odd fit. Instead, he gravitated towards London's burgeoning blues scene and, in 1962, joined Alexis Korner's Blues Incorporated on the recommendation of Charlie Watts  - who was leaving to join the Rolling Stones.  He gained early fame as a member of the Graham Bond Organisation alongside bassist Jack Bruce - but it was their partnership with Eric Clapton in Cream that made all three superstars. One of rock's first ""supergroups"", they fused blues and psychedelia to dazzling effect on songs like Strange Brew, Sunshine of Your Love, Badge and I Feel Free. They sold more than 35 million albums and were awarded the world's first ever platinum disc for their LP Wheels of Fire. Along with the Jimi Hendrix Experience, the band expanded the vocabulary of heavy rock, especially during their incendiary live shows, where the three musicians would stretch simple riffs into long, exploratory improvisations.  ""It was as if something else had taken over,"" Baker once said of playing with Cream. ""You're not conscious of playing. You're listening to this fantastic sound that you're a part of. And your part is just… happening. It was a gift, and we three had it in abundance."" But the volatility that fuelled their performances was rooted in animosity. Baker and Bruce's arguments were frequent and violent, even driving Clapton to tears on one occasion. Once, Baker attempted to end one of Bruce's solos by bouncing a stick off his snare drum, and into Bruce's head.  ""So I grabbed my double bass,"" Bruce later recalled, ""and demolished him and his kit.""  The band eventually split after two years and four albums, with a farewell concert at London's Royal Albert Hall in 1968. ""Cream came and went almost in the blink of an eye, but left an indelible mark on rock music,"" wrote Colin Larkin in the Encyclopaedia of Popular Music.  Bands who built on their template included Deep Purple, Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin - not that Baker was impressed.  ""I don't think Led Zeppelin filled the void that Cream left, but they made a lot of money,"" he told Forbes. Following the band's demise, he teamed up with Clapton and Steve Winwood to form Blind Faith, followed by the ambitious 10-piece Air Force, which combined his interests in jazz and Afro-fusion. While the musicianship was of a high standard, the eclectic mix of jazz, blues, African music and a surfeit of drums - there were three percussionists - was never going to inspire a mass following. After one studio album and a live concert at the Royal Albert Hall, Air Force, undermined by personnel changes, finally crashed and burned.  The drug-related death of his friend, Jimi Hendrix, persuaded Baker it was time to leave the London music scene and get clean. He left Britain to live in Nigeria, where he recorded with Fela Kuti and built his own recording studio. He helped Paul McCartney record the classic Wings' album Band On The Run, although their relationship soured over claims that he was never paid. Financial problems of one sort or another dogged him throughout this period and he eventually lost control of his studio. Away from music, he took up rally driving and, somewhat incongruously, developed a love of polo, building up a sizeable collection of ponies, despite his tendency to get injured. ""I've had a lot of falls which have wrecked my body,"" he told the Telegraph in 2013. ""They had to take a piece of my hip bone out and screw it into my neck."" In the 1980s, he played with John Lydon's Public Image Ltd, while continuing to form and discard new bands that combined his African and Western musical influences, like African Force and Middle Passage. While commercial success eluded him, his reputation, particularly with a new generation of drummers, remained high. ""His playing was revolutionary,"" said Neil Peart, drummer with the Canadian band Rush. ""He set the bar for what rock drumming could be."" Cream were inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993, briefly reuniting to play three songs, then teamed up again in 2005 for a series of concerts in London and New York.  Almost inevitably, the performances ended with Baker and Bruce fighting on stage. ""It's a knife-edge thing for me and Ginger,"" Bruce said afterward. ""Nowadays, we're happily co-existing in different continents... although I was thinking of asking him to move. He's still a bit too close."" Baker had, in fact, headed to South Africa, where he spent the reunion money buying polo ponies and funding a veterinary hospital.  In 2012, he became the subject of a hugely enjoyable documentary - Beware of Mr Baker - which illustrated how his jaw-dropping drumming was neither as wild nor as extraordinary as his personal life.  In the opening scene, the musician was seen attacking director Jay Bulger with a metal cane, declaring: ""I'm going to put you in hospital."" He later settled down to reflect, cantankerously, on the trail of broken bands, ex-wives and neglected children he'd left in his wake. Contributors marvelled at his talent, but little else. ""He influenced me as a drummer, but not as a person,"" recalled Free's Simon Kirke, who toured with Cream. In later years, he was beset by ill health, breaking most of his ribs and subsequently being diagnosed with a degenerative spine condition and the onset of emphysema. ""God is punishing me for my past wickedness by keeping me alive and in as much pain as He can,"" he told Rolling Stone at the time. The musician fought osteoarthritis to record his final album, Why?, in 2014. Two years later, he underwent open heart surgery and announced his retirement from touring. ""Just seen doctor… big shock… no more gigs for this old drummer... everything is off,"" he wrote on his official blog. ""Of all things I never thought it would be my heart."" Baker's death will see him feted as one of rock's most influential musicians, but he scoffed at such accolades, insisting: ""Drummers are really nothing more than time-keepers."" He told Rhythm magazine: ""It's the drummer's job to make the other guys sound good."" Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

Volatility,Will a market fall turn into a rout?,2024-09-25,2018-02-06,By Kamal Ahmed,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42958265,"To the great synchronisation - stronger global growth returning to all the major economic engines of the world - add the great normalisation. The softness of markets over the last few days is down to one thing. Monetary policy is starting its long journey away from the trillions of pounds of stimulus pumped into the system to keep the economic ship from the rocks. Now, shareholders are beginning to wonder how much of their investments are in companies with strong fundamentals. And how much is simply holding up an asset bubble - frothy prices led ever higher in an era of ultra low interest rates and cheap money. Fingers are hovering over the ""sell"" button. And once investors start looking at their portfolio and selling out of the froth, automatic algorithmic trading tends to ""chase the dip"". Central banks led by the Federal Reserve have been gently tightening - withdrawing stimulus - as concerns grow that inflation is returning. It is the first time there has been such a synchronisation in major central bank policy since the financial crisis. When the Federal Reserve spoke of ""tapering"" in 2014, the Bank of Japan was in full monetary easing mode. When the Fed raised interest rates in December 2015, the European Central Bank cut them further into negative territory. Now the Fed is signalling further interest rate rises. The ECB's quantitative easing programme - the purchasing of bonds - is being reduced. And the Bank of Japan has also slowed its purchasing of long dated bonds. The next move by the Bank of England on interest rates is likely to be up. Make no mistake - we still have monetary policy broadly set for recession despite global economic growth being at its most positive since the financial crisis. Globally, the economic fundamentals are strong and the market falls we have seen come after a record long run of equity highs. But be prepared for more volatility ahead as markets catch up with the fact that the era of endless central bank support is coming, slowly but surely, to an end."
Volatility,Sturgeon says UK economic crisis worst in memory,2024-09-25,2022-09-28,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-63063914,"Scotland's first minister has warned that the UK could be facing a worse economic crisis than the 2008 global financial crash.  Nicola Sturgeon described the fallout from tax cuts announced by the Chancellor last week as ""extraordinary and unprecedented"". Ms Sturgeon called for the UK government to reverse its income tax cuts for the highest earners. She said the move would be a sign of ""some kind of sense being restored"". The first minister was speaking as the Bank of England warned of a ""material risk to UK financial stability"" if the volatility continued. It said it would start buying government bonds at an ""urgent pace"" to help restore ""orderly market conditions"". The pound slumped in value by 1.6% against the dollar to $1.05 on Wednesday morning, while lenders withdrew about a quarter of mortgage products overnight as they grappled with the prospect of further rises in interest rates. And the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has rebuked the government's £45bn tax-cutting plans as being ""risky"" and likely to increase inequality.  Ms Sturgeon told a committee of senior MSPs at Holyrood that the Bank of England's intervention was  ""extraordinary"" and showed that the UK was in the ""grip of a rapidly deteriorating economic crisis"". And she said the mini-budget unveiled by Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng last Friday had sparked the most serious situation for the UK economy in memory, possibly even including the 2008 global financial crisis which led to governments having to bail-out banks and other financial institutions. The first minister called for immediate action to be taken, and for MPs to return early to the Parliament from recess.  And she said that ""as an immediate symbol of some kind of good sense being restored, the decision to abolish the top rate of tax should be reversed"". Ms Sturgeon added: ""I don't think it is possible to overstate the damage of this budget.""  Mr Kwarteng announced in last week's mini-budget that the basic rate of income tax will be cut from 20% to 19% from April of next year. He also pledged to abolish the 45% additional rate of tax, which is paid by people who earn more than £150,000 a year - a tax saving of nearly £3,000 a year for somebody with an annual income of £200,000. The chancellor insisted he was ""confident"" his tax-cutting strategy - which formed a key part of the campaign pitch by Prime Minister Liz Truss during the Conservative leadership election - would deliver the promised economic growth. The changes do not apply in Scotland, where income tax rates and bands are decided by the Scottish government.  It means the 40% higher rate, for earnings of over £50,270, will be the top rate elsewhere in the UK. But in Scotland everyone earning between £43,663 and £150,000 currently pays 41%, with those earning more than £150,000 paying 46%. Former Conservative MSP Prof Adam Tomkins described the UK government tax plans as being ""profoundly unconservative"" and proof that the UK ""needs a Labour government"". In a column for the Herald newspaper, Prof Tomkins - who left Holyrood last year - accused the Conservatives of ""trashing the economy"" and said it was clear that their time in power ""is up"". Meanwhile his former Scottish Conservative colleague, Graham Simpson MSP, told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme that he was unaware of the International Monetary Fund's concerns about the mini-budget, which were released on Tuesday and featured prominently across the media. When he was asked about the IMF intervention on Wednesday morning, Mr Graham responded: ""That's the first I've heard of it so you're springing that one on me"", before going on to say he thought the Chancellor was doing a good job.  The Scottish government will set out its taxation plans in the coming weeks - but Ms Sturgeon has already indicated that she will not follow the chancellor in cutting rates for the highest earners.  The Treasury has said its plans - which were to be funded by £72bn of borrowing and include scrapping the limit on bonuses for bankers - were focused on growing the economy, which it said would ""raise living standards for everyone"". But Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, who has pledged to reverse the income tax cuts for the wealthiest, said the government had ""completely lost control of the economy""."
Volatility,Investment boss in tearful video apology,2024-09-25,2018-11-21,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46295109,"The boss of a Florida-based financial firm has made a tearful video apology to clients after bad bets on oil and natural gas prices wiped out their investments. James Cordier blamed a recent bout of market volatility for the losses, which are set to destroy his firm. ""I truly invested your funds like you were family,"" he said in the 10-minute video posted on YouTube. ""I'm sorry that this rogue wave capsized our boat."" Natural gas prices enjoyed their biggest one-day percentage gain in eight years on Wednesday last week, only to suffered their largest one-day loss in 15 years the very next day. Meanwhile, oil prices have also fallen sharply. Mr Cordier is president of OptionSellers.com, based in Tampa, and co-wrote a book called The Complete Guide to Option Selling. The company managed money for wealthy investors and specialised in options, which give investors the right to buy or sell at a pre-determined price. OptionSellers said the losses were its ""clients' private business. We are in communication with them."" It was not clear how much money the firm managed or the size of the losses. Mr Cordier said in his video that he had 290 clients. However, the losses could total more than $150m, according to Ohio lawyer Jason Albin, who has been in contact with about 80 clients. Mr Albin said he thought the trades, which in some cases involved retirement accounts, should not have been permitted because of the risk involved.  He is looking at taking legal action against INTL FCStone, the brokerage that cleared the bets on behalf of Mr Cordier's company. INTL FCStone declined to comment on the claims. The firm said accounts managed by Optionsellers.com were liquidated after ""unprecedented volatility"" in the oil and gas markets last week. ""Although well collateralized, accounts managed by a commodities trading advisor, Optionsellers.com, had to be liquidated as a result of these moves,"" the company said. ""Liquidation of these accounts was in accordance with our customer agreements and our obligations under market regulation and standards."""
Volatility,Business confidence rises: Lloyds survey,2024-09-25,2017-06-25,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-40400214,"Business confidence has jumped to an 18-month high, but companies are having trouble recruiting skilled workers, according to a survey. The Lloyds Bank Business in Britain report's confidence index rose to 24% - double the level immediately following the EU referendum last year. The index is a measure of expected sales, orders and profits. A separate survey by the British Chambers of Commerce forecast weak economic growth for the next few years. The Lloyds Bank report surveyed the views of 1,500 UK companies in May, after the general election was called. The average for the confidence index in the 25 years the report has been compiled is 23%. The net balance of companies that said they had found it difficult to find skilled labour in the past six months hit a 10-year high of 52%.  That was up from 31% in January when the last report was released. The share of firms facing similar issues with unskilled workers also rose to 26%, up from 14%. Tim Hinton of Lloyds Banking Group said: ""Although challenges remain in recruiting both skilled and unskilled labour, businesses are anticipating higher sales, increased profits and staffing levels to rise.  ""However, the outlook remains mixed at best."" According to the survey, four out of six business sectors reported higher levels of confidence since January.  That was attributed mainly to increased demand from UK customers, which Lloyds said suggested was due to factors other than the help that weaker sterling had given to exporters. Hann-Ju Ho, senior economist at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, said: ""Although the pound's value is seen as nearer 'fair value', currency volatility remains a big concern for some UK businesses that trade internationally."" Meanwhile, the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) says that economic growth will remain anaemic over the next few years. The business group, which represents thousands of small and medium-sized companies, says annual GDP growth will not exceed 1.5% by 2020 and inflation could end up being higher than expected. The BCC expects inflation to average 2.9% this year and peak at 3.4% in the last three months of 2017, which it says will hit consumer spending. The group raised its forecast for economic growth from 1.4% to 1.5% for this year, but expected GDP to increase by just 1.3% next year. Adam Marshall, director-general of the BCC, said: ""Over recent months, many of the businesses I speak to have expressed cautious optimism for their own prospects, but remain wary about the growth prospects of the UK economy as a whole.  ""In the wake of an inconclusive general election, that wariness is set to increase."" The group has urged the government to spend more on infrastructure, particularly broadband and mobile phone connectivity, while it has described the UK's road network as sclerotic. In May the Office for National Statistics said the economy expanded by 0.2% in the first three months of the year, down from its first estimate of 0.3%, as the key services sector lost momentum."
Volatility,Rescue of Bulb set to cost taxpayers billions more,2024-09-25,2022-03-08,By Simon Jack,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60653751,"Keeping Bulb Energy running will potentially cost taxpayers billions of pounds more than has currently been set aside, government officials have said.  Bulb, which has 1.6 million customers, was quasi-nationalised in late November when it was put into special administration as it buckled under rising wholesale gas prices.   In November, wholesale prices were around £2 per unit.  Since then, prices have been consistently higher than that.  They hit peaks of £4.70 in December and as high as £8 on Monday - 20 times the prices seen last year - during extreme volatility.   At the time Bulb was placed in special administration, the Treasury set aside £1.7bn to purchase the gas required until the end of the tax year in April 2022 by which time it was hoped a buyer would be found for the business.   Government officials have conceded that the prospect of offloading the business to a private buyer seems remote in this environment and that means that taxpayers will be on the hook for a gas bill that energy analysts believe could run to billions of pounds.   A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: ""The Special Administrator of Bulb is obligated to keep costs of the administration process as low as possible, and we continue to engage closely with them throughout to ensure maximum value for money for taxpayers.""  The extreme volatility in energy markets has seen some customers prepared to pay £3,500 a year to fix their energy bills for two years, according to another large energy operator.  That is well above the energy price cap of £1,971 that comes into effect in April but that cap is subject to potential further increases every six months.  Industry analysts estimate the next energy price cap could be set at £3,000 or more from October.   Other energy retailers are reluctant to offer or recommend customers lock in at such high prices as they fear they could be trapped on high tariffs if and when prices return to more normal levels.  Some may be prepared to pay a high price for the peace of mind conferred by knowing what their outgoings will be. Millions of customers will simply be unable to afford energy bills later this year - despite the government's two-stage £9bn energy bill support package.  This will offer consumers a £150 council tax rebate in April and a £200 loan in October to be repaid at £40 a year for the next five years.   "
Volatility,Global shares jump on second Covid vaccine hopes,2024-09-25,2020-11-16,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-54959414,"Global share prices have surged following news of a second breakthrough coronavirus vaccine, following last week's positive results from Pfizer. Interim data from the US firm Moderna suggests its vaccine is highly effective in preventing people getting ill and works across all age groups. The news pushed Moderna shares more than 9% higher and the Dow to a record. It also lifted firms hit by the virus, with British Airways owner IAG rising 10% and Cineworld up 13.5%. In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average hit a new high, after jumping about 1.6%. The wider S&P 500 increased almost 1.2% from Friday's record and the Nasdaq gained 0.8%. Earlier, the UK's FTSE 100 share index closed about 1.6% higher, while the main market in Paris rose 1.7% and in Germany shares gained 0.5%. Last week, stock markets enjoyed one of their best ever days when a vaccine by Pfizer/BioNTech raised hopes that the business world might return to normal next year. A number of other vaccines are also being developed. The gains spurred by Moderna's news on Monday were more muted but still helped the MSCI World Index of global shares to rise further, climbing to a new record high. Firms that have been hit most badly in the pandemic have seen the biggest rises. In the travel sector, cruise line Carnival jumped more than 10%, while Intercontinental Hotels closed almost 5% higher. The prospect of an end to lockdowns also helped oil prices strengthen. Brent and West Texas Intermediate crude prices were up about 3%, and shares in energy companies also gained. The price of gold - which is often seen as a safer asset in times of uncertainty - slipped 0.7% before recovering. Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at US Bank Wealth Management, said markets are being driven by a ""tug-of-war between optimism over COVID-19 vaccine progress versus fear of economic slowing as COVID-19 cases continue to rise"". But he said low interest rates, stimulus and medical progress give him a ""glass half-full"" outlook. ""We expect equity prices to inch higher into year-end and 2021, with increased volatility being more the norm than exception,"" he said, Until vaccines can be rolled out, rising cases of the coronavirus were a risk, said Morgan Stanley strategists in a research note to investors. But the investment bank urged shareholders to ""keep the faith... We think this global recovery is sustainable, synchronous and supported by policy""."

Volatility,FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried arrested in Bahamas,2024-09-25,2022-12-13,By Peter Hoskins,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63953096,"Sam Bankman-Fried, founder of the collapsed cryptocurrency exchange FTX, has been arrested in The Bahamas, the country's attorney general has said. He is scheduled to appear on Tuesday in a magistrates' court in the Caribbean country's capital, Nassau. Police said Mr Bankman-Fried, 30, was arrested for ""financial offences"" against laws in the US and The Bahamas. Last month, FTX filed for bankruptcy in the US, leaving many users unable to withdraw their funds. According to a court filing, FTX owed its 50 largest creditors almost $3.1bn (£2.5bn). Among the most serious allegations against Mr Bankman-Fried is that he used billions of dollars of customer funds to prop up his investment trading company, Alameda. It is unclear how much people who have funds in the exchange will get back at the end of bankruptcy proceedings - though many experts have warned it may be a small fraction of what they deposited. Speaking to the BBC earlier this month, Mr Bankman-Fried acknowledged that mistakes were made at the firm, but sought to distance himself from accusations of illegal activity. ""I didn't knowingly commit fraud, I don't think I committed fraud, I didn't want any of this to happen. I was certainly not nearly as competent as I thought I was,"" he told the BBC. He also denied allegations that he must have been aware that Alameda was using FTX customer funds. ""No that's not true,"" Mr Bankman-Fried said, while going on to acknowledge that as chief executive he was ultimately responsible for any mishandling of funds. ""That's on me, one way or another,"" he said. The FTX exchange allowed customers to trade normal money for cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. Cryptocurrencies are not currencies in the traditional sense, but are stored online and act more like investment vehicles or securities - often with a high degree of volatility. Their anonymity means they have been favoured for criminal activities such as drug dealing and ransomware attacks, but their supporters say there is huge potential for innovation - and independence from governments. Mr Bankman-Fried was once viewed as a young version of legendary US investor Warren Buffett, and as recently as late October had a net worth estimated at more than $15bn. Before FTX's collapse he seemingly delighted in giving his Twitter followers an insight into his lifestyle, which involved playing League of Legends while on phone calls, even while attempting to woo investors, and sleeping on a beanbag next to his desk in the office. He had become well known in Washington DC as a political donor, mostly to Democratic politicians or groups, supposedly supporting pandemic prevention and improved crypto regulation. Mr Bankman-Fried will be held in custody ""pursuant of our nation's Extradition Act,"" the Attorney General of the Bahamas said in a statement. ""Earlier this evening, Bahamian authorities arrested Samuel Bankman-Fried at the request of the US Government, based on a sealed indictment filed by the SDNY [Southern District of New York]. We expect to move to unseal the indictment in the morning and will have more to say at that time,"" the US Attorney's office in Manhattan said in a tweet. Wall Street regulators also said that they would be taking action against Mr Bankman-Fried. ""We commend our law enforcement partners for working to secure the arrest of Mr Sam Bankman-Fried in the Bahamas on federal criminal charges,"" US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) official Gurbir Grewal said in a statement. ""The Securities and Exchange Commission has separately authorised charges relating to Mr. Bankman-Fried's violations of our securities laws, which will be filed publicly tomorrow in the Southern District of New York,"" he added. Mr Bankman-Fried had been due to testify about the collapse of FTX before the US Congress on Tuesday. However, he will now be unable to testify, according to Congresswoman Maxine Waters, who said in a statement that she was surprised to hear that he had been arrested. Mr Bankman-Fried's lawyer did not immediately reply to a BBC request for comment. FTX, the owner and operator of the FTX.COM cryptocurrency exchange, was founded in 2019 by Mr Bankman-Fried, a former Wall Street trader, and ex-Google employee Gary Wang. It became the second largest crypto exchange in the world, trading about $10bn of cryptocurrencies a day. But on 11 November FTX filed for bankruptcy protection after users pulled $6bn from the platform in three days and rival exchange Binance abandoned a rescue deal. At the same time, Mr Bankman-Fried resigned as FTX's chief executive. The collapse of FTX came during a tumultuous year for the cryptocurrency industry. This year Bitcoin has lost more than 60% of its value, while other cryptocurrencies have also slumped."
Volatility,No malpractice by council in energy mishap- report,2024-09-25,2022-07-28,By Claire Hamilton,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-merseyside-62335765,"Lack of oversight, poor communication and staff too afraid to raise the alarm caused Liverpool City Council's energy bill to soar by £10m, an inquiry has found.  Accountants Mazars examined what led to the council signing off an energy contract which turned out to be void.  However, the report found ""no evidence of malpractice or a cover-up"" by any council employee. There was also no evidence of staff ""playing the market"", it added. The specialist accountants said a combination of factors led to the council's cabinet signing off on an extension to its electricity contract with Scottish Power at a meeting on 4 March, despite the firm having already withdrawn from the commercial market.  As a result, the council was placed on a more expensive tariff. This has impacted schools and Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service (MFRS), which get their energy via council contracts. 'Systematic problems'  The cabinet had not been informed of the company's market withdrawal before it was asked to agree to the deal and the mayor and senior councillors were not made aware of the error until it was too late, the report said.   The council's chief executive, Tony Reeves, resigned earlier this month. The report said the ""chief executive officer did not have controls in place to flag major risks ahead of time"". It added that he had ""insufficient knowledge of the detail of major contracts"" and that he was ""not aware of the significant work pressures of council employees"". Mr Reeves previously told a council committee that he could not ""be expected to have granular knowledge of each council contract... and he acted as soon as he was alerted to the problem"".  Cabinet member and culture change lead, Frazer Lake, said the council's internal processes had been tightened because ""the control measures in place weren't robust enough"".  ""There was confusion around roles and responsibilities,"" he said.   Government-appointed commissioners were brought in to run parts of the council in March 2021 after inspectors found a ""serious breakdown of governance"" and ""multiple apparent failures"". Lead commissioner Mike Cunningham said the contracts issue was symptomatic of the problems at the council. ""There are human errors here. But the things that need sorting out are systematic and organisational rather than one or two mistakes,"" he said.   Mr Cunningham added: ""Liverpool City Council is still emerging from a culture where openness and transparency and clarity were not things that were celebrated, and many people operated in a culture where it wasn't safe to speak out and where you got into trouble for speaking truth to power."" The report does not say exactly how much money the mistake will have cost the council, something which Liberal Democrat leader Richard Kemp said meant the whole exercise had been a ""complete waste of money"".  ""For over £100,000, we have learned nothing that we didn't know from the Caller report,"" he said.  ""Meanwhile schools are on holiday and will return in September having to set their budgets still not knowing what impact this will have"".  Mr Lake said: ""Schools and the fire service had already budgeted for an increase due to the volatility of the energy market"", but he said any decision to pay any extra costs from council reserves would have to be made by the cabinet at a later date. Mr Cunningham said the council needed to operate with ""a greater sense of urgency"", adding: ""What we are saying is the pace of change is not what it should be and that needs to alter.""  ""This is a big organisation spending a lot of public money. It's going to be tough to turn the tanker around, it's not for the faint-hearted,"" he said.  A council spokeswoman said: ""The city council has since approved a new energy contract with Crown Commercial Services, which will run until March 2025. ""This final cost to the council, the Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service and the city's schools, of being on a variable tariff between 1 April and 30 June is expected to be reported to the council in August.""

Volatility,"Future uncertain but could be rosy, farmers say",2024-09-25,2023-03-17,By Judy Hobson & Becky Holmes,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-lancashire-64987104,"Farmers dealing with extreme weather, rising costs and labour shortages have said they face an ""uncertain"" future as changes to subsidies are rolled out. The post-Brexit farm payments scheme will finance environmental work and sustainable food production. One farmer said money and guidance was needed, while another said the future could be ""rosy"" but would not be easy. The government said the new scheme would help farmers to ""produce food profitably and sustainably"". EU subsidies used to pay farmers for the amount of land they farmed but now there is a new emphasis on looking after the environment.  The new environmental land management schemes (Elms) will pay farmers public money for actions like managing crop pests without chemicals and working towards net zero. The measures have been broadly welcomed by farming and environmental groups. Sheep farmer John Alpe, told BBC North West Tonight he had already taken advantage of some environmental schemes. However, Mr Alpe, who owns New Laund Farm in Whitewell in the Ribble Valley, said the uncertainty on funding had led to him cutting down on the size of his flock. He said one of his main challenges was rising feed costs. He said he uses between 80 to 100 tonnes a year and the price had gone up by between £150 to £200 a tonne. At the same time, the price being paid for lamb has dropped. He said there was ""no real understanding of how much it's going to be and what we've to do"", so he planned to ""sit quiet and just not spend very much money other than what we need to do"". Whatever happens though, he said he was certain of one thing. ""We won't have more, that's for sure. There will be less.""  Ed Towers, a dairy farmer based at Brades Farm Dairy in Farleton, Lancaster, said 10% of his business relies on government subsidies.  He said like many farmers, he welcomed a more environmentally friendly focus, but said the new scheme lacked detail, making it difficult to plan for the future.  ""I would like to see greater investment opportunities for making the improvements that they want,"" he said.  ""If you want us to have all electric tractors… we need to have the money and the guidance for it."" He said the volatility of milk prices had forced him to investigate a niche market, with his farm becoming the first in the UK to produce milk specifically designed for creating latte art.   He said it offered some protection from fluctuating milk prices, but he was also trying to make other changes to improve the farm's environmental credentials, which has increased costs. He said half of the farm's carbon footprint was ""the methane that comes off the cows and so we didn't want to be part of the problem of climate change, we wanted to be part of the solution"". A diet including a garlic and citrus supplement cut methane emissions by 30%, but it is expensive and has led Mr Towers to sell carbon credits to offset the cost.  Some arable farmers like Lucy and Edd Houghton, from Lymm, Cheshire, have changed what they are planting to combat rising costs of fuel and fertiliser. Their farm produce 300 tonnes of malting barley every year for a single brewery, which has given some financial security, but Mrs Houghton said the price for other crops fluctuated. ""We're getting very good prices for our wheat which is on the back of the Ukraine war,"" she said.  ""At the moment though, the fertiliser costs have increased three times and the cost of fuel is also putting quite a strain on the farm.""  In 2020, they spent £20,000 on fertiliser, but this year, that has risen to almost £90,000. That means they have changed some of the crops on their 700-acre farm and planted oats, which need less fertiliser, while also finding other streams of income, such as spraying crops for 80 local farmers and supplying hay bales for weddings and private functions.  Beef farmer Maggie Kelly has also made changes. Her family now has one of England's biggest pedigree Hereford herds at Nether Hall Farm in the Lune Valley, despite originally having a completely different breed. She said the rising cost of feed forced a change to ""a more efficient cow"", as they were working their socks off and ""making no money"".  ""We used to have a big herd of Limousin's, and there were so many inputs... that we wanted a breed that we could manage on grass."" The National Farmers' Union said it was continuing to work with government to improve its new subsidy schemes, so farmers have all the details they need. ""If Elms is to be successful, we've always said that it needs to be simple, provide certainty and fairly reward farmers for taking part,"" the spokesman said.  The Department for Environment Food & Rural Affairs said farming and nature ""can and must go hand in hand"". ""This is essential to support resilient food production,"" a representative said. ""Through our new Elms, we pay farmers to take actions that are good for the farm, good for food production and good for the environment."" They added that the government had ""provided comprehensive details of the schemes which have something on offer for every type of farmer and give them the flexibility to choose what works best for them and their land"". ""They will support farmers to produce food profitably and sustainably, including £600m in grants for equipment to help them become more productive."" Despite the challenges ahead, many farmers do remain hopeful for the future, Mr Alpe said. He said he believed his farm would still be viable when it was time for his son to take over as farmers were ""resilient"" by nature. Ms Kelly added the industry could still thrive if the government made British farming a priority. ""Farmers always step up and feed the population, so I think that the future is going to be really rosy,"" she said.  ""I don't think it will be easy, but I think it will be good.""

The Glasgow-based distiller, whose portfolio includes The Famous Grouse, The Macallan and Cutty Sark, saw group revenue jump by 22% to £701.3m in the year to 31 March. Pre-tax profits climbed by 31% to £189m. Edrington said higher investment in brand marketing and ""greater focus on consumers"" had contributed to ""an encouraging performance"". It added that its results had also been ""impacted significantly"" by the fall in the value of sterling against all major currencies. The company boosted marketing spend during the year by 18% to £110.7m, as part of a drive to ""invest for the long-term health of our brands"". In its annual review, the group said The Famous Grouse ""retained and strengthened its leading market position in the UK"".  However, it also pointed out that ""the continued suppression of the blends market"" had an adverse impact on both that brand, and Cutty Stark. Its Brugal rum brand returned to strong growth in its two core markets - the Dominican Republic and Spain - while delivering ""positive momentum in other markets"". There was also a good performance from its Highland Park single malt, despite a ""highly competitive environment"".

Volatility,Oil cartel leader says demand expected to grow,2024-09-25,2023-10-02,By Faarea Masud,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-66985654,"Demand for oil will continue to grow and remain ""resilient"" this year, according to the secretary general of Opec+. Opec+ is a group of 23 oil-exporting countries which decides how much crude oil to sell on the world market. ""We see demand growing about 2.4 million barrels a day,"" Haitham Al Ghais told the BBC. Saudi Arabia said it would be cutting its production of crude oil by a million barrels a day to boost prices. The International Energy Agency (IEA) said the decision by Saudi Arabia and Russia - two major oil producers and members of Opec+ - to cut production could cause a ""significant supply shortfall"" by the end of this year. Mr Al Ghais said: ""This is a voluntary decision taken by two sovereign nations, Saudi Arabia and Russia. This decision can be described as precautionary or pre-emptive because of uncertainties"". Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, oil prices soared, hitting more than $120 a barrel in June last year. They fell back to a little above $70 a barrel in May this year, but have steadily risen since then as producers have tried to restrict output to support the market. Brent crude, a benchmark for prices, breached $95 a barrel on Tuesday amid predictions of shorter supplies, with fears the price may breach $100 per barrel. The rise prompted a warning to drivers that fuel prices could rise in the coming 10 months, and stoked fears that inflation in key economies could be prolonged. But Mr Al Ghais said Opec was more concerned about ""under investment"" in the oil sector. ""Some have called for stopping investments in oil. We believe this is equally dangerous. It will lead to volatility in the future, possible supply shortages. And therefore we at Opec have always advocated for the importance of continuing to invest in the oil industry as we also invest in decarbonising the industry and move on to adding other forms of alternative energy such as renewables"". Asked if he was concerned about rising oil prices affecting inflation around the world if it goes above $100 a barrel, Mr Al Ghais said it was ""important not to look at things in a short-sighted manner"". ""For next year we see demand continuing to grow north of 2 million barrels a day - of course, all subject to some of the uncertainties in the global market. Nevertheless, we still feel quite optimistic... that global oil demand is going to be quite resilient this year"". Mr Al Ghais said that the oil industry would need close to $14tn in investment to the year 2045. ""Energy demand will grow by nearly 25% by the year 2045 compared to what it is today - and all forms of energy will be required"", he said. His comments come ahead of a meeting of key oil players on Wednesday in Abu Dhabi for the International Petroleum Exhibition and Conference (ADIPEC)."
Volatility,Sports Direct profits more than halve,2024-09-25,2017-07-20,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-40665459,"Profits at Sports Direct have plummeted nearly 60%, which the retailer said was largely due to the weaker pound. The slide in sterling means the firm has had to pay more for its imported goods, and its underlying pre-tax profit fell to £113.7m from £275.2m. However, chief executive Mike Ashley said trading at its new ""flagship"" stores was going well.  Sports Direct's reputation has been badly hit by revelations about staff conditions at its Derbyshire warehouse.  Chairman Keith Hellawell said the company had made ""positive progress"" across the business as it continued to ""strive to ensure that all of our people are treated with dignity and respect"". A recent survey of workers in Shirebrook, to which 3,300 people responded, had showed that an ""overwhelming majority"" of people in the warehouse ""currently feel they are treated with respect"", he added. Staff had elected the company's first UK workers' representative and Mr Hellawell said he had ""no doubt"" their ""contribution will prove invaluable to the board as the Sports Direct family continues to move forward together"". Sports Direct, which has been without a chief financial officer since last October, also said it had appointed Jon Kempster to the role. Mr Kempster is set to join the company on 11 September.  Mr Ashley said Sports Direct was trying to ""conservatively manage the currency volatility that is reflected in our full year results"". Sports Direct imports many of its products from abroad and the pound's fall against the dollar had led to a ""significant fall in profits"", he added. However, he said the company had now put in place hedging arrangements to ""minimise the short-term impact of currency volatility"". The company's key strategy is to turn itself into the ""Selfridges of sport"", and Mr Hellawell said the ""elevation of our retail proposition continues to be a key objective"". Sports Direct said it was forming a ""new strategic partnership"" with sportswear firm Asics. The Japanese company will manage dedicated areas within Sports Direct's new upmarket ""premium"" stores.  Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said this had been a ""transformational"" year for Sports Direct.  Progress was being made on the new premium stores, he said, and they were ""a lot more profitable than the existing Sports Direct stores"". The retailer's shares rose by 6% following the release of the results as investors appeared to welcomed the progress it was making to move upmarket.   In recent months, Sports Direct has bought 26% stake in Game Digital, increased its stake in Debenhams, acquired lingerie firm Agent Provocateur and snapped up the US sports clothing and outdoor equipment chains Bob's Stores and Eastern Mountain Sports.  The company's ""spending spree on acquisitions"" had affected profits, Mr Wilson said.  ""That's something to bear in mind when we're looking at these figures and also what that does is it puts Sports Direct in a better position to make a strategic move in, for example, the department store area or in the US with its US acquisitions."" It doesn't look good on paper. But for analysts watching the company this seems like the beginning of the end of a difficult period for Sports Direct.  Financially, it's now protected against a further drop in the pound. Better late than never.   Reputationally, the damage it suffered from its alleged Dickensian treatment of workers is being addressed with a worker on the board of the company.   It's smartening up its shops and restating its goal to be the ""Selfridges of sport"".  The monkey isn't quite off its back. Chief executive Mike Ashley is still facing a court case about a £15m pub bet, which is generating colourful headlines.  But as the chairman ends his statement by saying, Sports Direct has been a big contributor to the UK economy with thousands of jobs and billions in tax. "
Volatility,How Bitcoin is infiltrating the $60bn global art market,2024-09-25,2017-07-24,By Matthew Wall,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-40703182,"Why is the art world getting excited about digital currency Bitcoin and its underlying technology blockchain? Eleesa Dadiani owns and runs an art gallery in London's famous Cork Street. She was born in Georgia in the Caucasus and was ""breastfed by gypsies"". But she is also a passionate believer in the power of Bitcoin and other digital currencies. When we meet she is busy preparing for an exhibition of sculptures made from the exhausts of former Formula 1 racing cars. One of these strange rib-cage-like creations made from the super-strong alloy inconel has been gold-plated and will sell for about £35,000. ""These are pieces of history,"" she tells me. In a first for the tradition-bound art world of Cork Street, her international clientele will have the opportunity to pay using Bitcoin, the digital cryptocurrency underpinned by blockchain technology. The gallery will also accept other cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, Dash, Litecoin, and soon, Monero, she says. Why? ""This is not a demand-driven decision at all, it's intuitive based on the way things are going,"" she says. She believes paying by cryptocurrency will become as normal as paying by cash or credit card. She also hopes it will attract a new, non-traditional type of art investor. Blockchain, the underlying technology, is a digital ledger or record of transactions that is distributed across, and verified by, thousands of computers in a network. Once the network has reached a consensus that a transaction has happened, the ledger is updated and cannot be tampered with.    ""Blockchain is a borderless, open source, decentralised peer-to-peer network that governments cannot shut down,"" she says. ""For me, the blockchain is going to be the biggest thing since the internet."" And the fact that there is no centralised body - like a bank head office, for example - makes cryptocurrencies safer, she argues, despite their reputation for being volatile, high-risk and the favourite ""store of value"" for criminals and hackers.  Bitcoin payments can be anonymous and potentially beyond the grasp of tax authorities, but this isn't the reason she's offering payment by cryptocurrency, she assures me.  So how easy is it to accept a Bitcoin payment? ""It's really very simple,"" she explains. ""I give the client my public key [a long string of letters and numbers] and they use that to send bitcoin to my account from their digital wallet or bitcoin exchange,"" she says.  ""My wallet is linked to my personal bank so I can then convert those bitcoins into pounds, euros or dollars.""  Ms Dadiani is such a fan of cryptocurrencies - she trades in them as well - that she is launching her own version, Dadicoin, later this year. The $60bn art world in general is warming to the potential of cryptocurrencies, partly because of blockchain's dual ability to establish the provenance of works of art and thereby reduce the reliance on brokers and other middlemen. Marcelo Garcia Casil, for example, is chief executive and co-founder of Maecenas, an online marketplace that will enable art owners to sell shares in their expensive works of art (worth more than $1m) and raise money far more cheaply than they could though a bank. And the owners also get to keep possession of their artworks while sharing up to 49% of the ownership. Investors, who ordinarily wouldn't be able to afford multi-million-dollar works of art, will be able buy shares or units in the work using cryptocurrency. They will then be able to sell these units later in the marketplace. Each transaction is recorded cryptographically on the Ethereum blockchain. ""We want to make fine art accessible for everyone,"" says Mr Casil, who was born in Argentina, now lives in Singapore, and has a background in investment banking.  ""The old auction houses like Christie's and Sotheby's have controlled the art market for centuries, so we think the opportunity for disruption is huge."" Establishing the authenticity of works of art is critical to their value, and this will still need to be done by skilled professionals, admits Mr Casil. ""But once the provenance has been recorded in the blockchain, you never have to do it again,"" he says. This takes a lot of cost out of the system. Maecenas has already attracted works of art worth $100m (£77m; 86m euros) in total, says Mr Casil, and the marketplace is due for launch in September. The art world has been flirting with Bitcoin for a few years now, despite the likes of auction house Sotheby's saying they have no plans to accept the currency. In April 2015, the Austrian Museum of Applied Art/Contemporary Art (MAK) was the first museum in the world to buy a work of art using Bitcoin. Dutch artist Harm van den Dorpel created a limited-edition screensaver that was cryptographically authenticated through blockchain. And online gallery Cointemporary exhibits digital artworks by international contemporary artists that can only be bought with Bitcoin. Purchases are handled by Coinbase, a leading cryptocurrency exchange. Blockchain establishes the chain of ownership, preventing anyone from stealing or tampering with the work. But will Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies ever really become a mainstream alternative to traditional money? Views differ widely. In Japan, there is a big move to equip 260,000 retail locations with bitcoin capability, and a few high-street retailers, such as Lush, have opted to accept the currency. But Joe Pindar, a director at cyber-security company Gemalto, says: ""At present there are very few businesses accepting bitcoin as a payment method - less than 1% of all retailers.  ""The biggest barrier to adoption is the length of time it takes to settle a payment in person, with transactions taking tens of minutes.  Despite this, Mr Pindar says several large retailers have been experimenting with the cryptocurrency, but may choose ""to adopt bitcoin for online purchases only, where time to process a payment is less important."" The currency's volatility is an issue - the value of one bitcoin topped $3,000 in June, before crashing to below $1,900 in July - and transactions are taking longer and longer to process.  This is largely to do with the rules governing how Bitcoin works, and there is currently a big row over how the issue should be resolved. It could be that blockchain proves to be more important to the art world than its flashier Bitcoin offspring."
Volatility,Covid worries help Bitcoin to three-year high,2024-09-25,2020-11-18,By Justin Harper,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-54982604,"Bitcoin, the world's best-known cryptocurrency, has jumped above $17,000 (£12,800) to hit a three-year high. The digital currency has suffered plenty of wild price swings since it was launched in 2009. But investors have been flocking to cryptocurrencies during the pandemic-driven volatility on global stock markets. However, experts have cautioned about viewing them as a ""safe haven"". On Wednesday, Bitcoin had climbed more than 7% to $17,891, its highest level since December 2017. Some analysts said the Covid-19 pandemic has encouraged investors to reassess the long-term outlook for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. But there are still concerns about the fraudulent trading in cryptocurrencies following a succession of high-profile hacks. During times of volatility, investors tend to move their money out of shares and into what are considered safer havens, like cash and gold. Some feel cryptocurrencies are now being viewed as a shelter from stock market volatility. ""Covid-19 has disrupted the traditional safe-haven trade and gold's inability to outperform. Periods of extreme risk aversion have forced many traders to diversify into Bitcoin,"" said Edward Moya, at trading firm Oanda. One attraction of Bitcoin is its limited supply, which is capped at 21 million. Some feel this scarcity provides an innate value and shields Bitcoin from inflation, which is becoming a worry. But Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy and chief economist at AMP Capital, warned about jumping into Bitcoin. ""Its huge volatility hardly makes it a safe haven as a store of value. I have far more confidence in the $50 note in my wallet retaining its value over time than Bitcoin, which seems to bounce around like a yo-yo."" Last month, PayPal announced that its customers will be able to buy, sell and hold Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies using their PayPal accounts, allowing customers to buy things from the 26 million sellers which accept PayPal, it said. Next year, PayPal plans to allow cryptocurrency to be used as a funding source. But Oanda's Mr Moya warned traders to prepare for more volatility. ""The amount of hedge funds and high-frequency trading systems driving Bitcoin higher will likely deliver exaggerated moves once its price nears the $20,000 level,"" he added. ""Traders need to expect $1,000 swings in a matter of minutes.""   Some believe the recent rise in Bitcoin is partly driven by the ""fear of missing out"" (FOMO).  ""Its rebound is creating more interest from speculators and so they are jumping in which then pushes it even higher,"" added Mr Oliver. ""I think most people would put more faith in a digital currency run by their government rather than one like Bitcoin that they have trouble understanding or explaining."" China is one such country working towards launching its own government-backed digital currency - known as Digital Currency Electronic Payment (DCEP). One trader, Jon Son, told the BBC: ""I think more people are beginning to buy Bitcoin first not to miss the rise and then research into what exactly Bitcoin is."""
Volatility,Sydney cut off from rest of Australia amid outbreak,2024-09-25,2020-12-21,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-55390731,"Australian states and territories have begun enforcing entry bans on Sydney residents amid a growing coronavirus outbreak in the nation's largest city. The border closures outside New South Wales (NSW) have dashed Christmas plans and family reunions for many people. Airlines cancelled several flights leaving Sydney Airport on Monday, following a midnight deadline. The city has recorded 83 cases so far in this outbreak, all linked to Sydney's Northern Beaches region. Speaking from Canberra on Monday, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said: ""2020 is not done with us yet."" ""The events of the past few days... are incredibly frustrating and disappointing for people all around the country who had plans in place to get together and move in between states."" However, he and others welcomed the dip in new case numbers reported on Monday. NSW state authorities recorded 15 new infections - half the previous day's numbers - out of a record 38,000 tests conducted in 24 hours. Many viewed the numbers as encouraging that the virus had not spread further beyond the Northern Beaches, which is subject to a local lockdown. But authorities warned that one day's results were not enough to determine a trend. ""Obviously, we have halved the number of cases overnight, but in a pandemic, there is a level of volatility, so we'll closely monitor what happens,"" said NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian. She said it was too early to tell whether wider restrictions for the city's five million residents would ease in time for Christmas. Australia - currently seeing all but no cases outside Sydney - has become known for its swift and aggressive response to outbreaks this year. In Sydney, indoor gatherings have been limited to 10 guests, and all residents have been told to minimise their social activity and to wear a mask in public spaces. Those living in the Northern Beaches will remain in lockdown until at least Wednesday. On Sunday, Queensland, Victoria, South Australia and the Australian Capital Territory announced bans on Sydney residents entering their state, adding to bans in other places. Those states' residents were told to return within a 12-hour window or face 14 days in quarantine upon arriving home. Anticipation of these orders prompted an exodus from Sydney on the weekend, with many residents leaving the city before the border shutdowns. Australia so far has recorded 908 deaths and 28,200 cases in the pandemic - a level far lower than seen in many other nations. The country took early decisions to close the nation's borders and mandate hotel quarantine for returning travellers from overseas. But experts have also credited its success on states acting quickly to lock down hotspot areas and conduct rapid contact tracing and testing processes. For months in NSW, restaurants and gyms have been required to log the contact details of all patrons. Such processes had helped the state stay on top of outbreaks, said Premier Berejkilian. ""We do have one of the best, if not the best, contact tracing teams on the planet,"" she said on Monday. But the state government has also faced criticism from some experts, who say it should make mask-wearing mandatory in public. Scrutiny has again fallen on the hotel quarantine system - which is believed to be the source of Sydney's new outbreak, as it was with previous outbreaks in Melbourne and Adelaide. Testing has shown the latest outbreak is likely to have come from the US. However, it remains unknown how the virus was taken into the community."
Volatility,Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war,2024-09-25,2023-06-21,By Soutik Biswas,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-65679616,"Last week, a retired lieutenant general in India's army bemoaned the volatile situation in his native Manipur, a violence-wracked state in the north-east of the country. ""The state is now 'stateless',"" tweeted L Nishikanta Singh. ""Life and property can be destroyed anytime by anyone just like in Libya, Lebanon, Nigeria, Syria etc.""  Nearly two months after it was convulsed by ethnic violence, Manipur is teetering on what many believe is the brink of a civil war. Clashes between the majority Meitei and Kuki communities have left more than 100 dead and over 400 wounded.  Nearly 60,000 people have been displaced and taken shelter in some 350 camps. Some 40,000 security forces - army soldiers, paramilitaries, police - are struggling to quell the violence. Only a quarter of the more than 4,000 weapons looted by mobs from police armouries have been voluntarily returned since the violence began.  The level of mistrust between the warring communities has sharpened, with both accusing security forces of being partisan. More than 200 churches and 17 temples have been destroyed or damaged by mobs. Homes of local ministers and legislators have been attacked and set on fire.   Normal life has been strangled: a night curfew continues in most of the 16 districts; schools are shut and internet services have been suspended. A main highway for ferrying supplies has been blocked by protesters. There are sporadic killings and arson. The federal government's proposal for a peace panel to broker a truce has received a tepid response.  ""This is the darkest moment in Manipur's history,"" says Binalakshmi Nepram of Northeast India Women Initiative for Peace. ""In two days [when the violence began], homes were burnt and people were lynched, burnt and tortured. Manipur has not seen this kind and type of violence in its modern history."" Eight states in India's restive and remote north-eastern region are home to some 45 million people belonging to more than 400 communities. More than a dozen peace talks trying to mediate between groups across the region have been dragging on for years. Nestling along the border with Myanmar, Manipur is no stranger to ethnic violence.  With some 33 ethnic tribes, the state is extremely diverse - and sharply divided. It is home to some 40 insurgent groups. Meitei, Naga and Kuki rebels have waged prolonged armed campaigns, frequently targeting Indian security forces, in protest against controversial anti-insurgent laws such as the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA), which grants search and seizure powers to the security forces. Meitei, Naga and Kuki militias have also fought one another over conflicting homeland demands. The majority Meiteis make up more than half of Manipur's estimated 3.3 million people. Some 43% of the people are Kukis and Nagas, the two predominant tribal communities, who live in the rolling hills. Most Meiteis follow the Hindu faith, while most Kukis adhere to Christianity.  Previous ethnic - and religious - clashes in Manipur have claimed hundreds of lives. ""This time, the conflict is strictly rooted in ethnicity, not religion,"" says Dhiren A Sadokpam, editor of The Frontier Manipur. May's large-scale violence was sparked by a controversy over affirmative action: Kukis protested against the demand seeking tribal status for the Meiteis. But this does not entirely explain the explosive ethnic violence that has engulfed Manipur.  The underlying tensions in the region stem from a complex interplay of various factors, including a long-standing insurgency, a controversial recent war on drugs, illegal migration from troubled Myanmar through porous borders, pressure on land, and a lack of employment opportunities, which make the young vulnerable to recruitment by rebel groups.  Adding to the volatility, say experts, is the alleged complicity of politicians in the drug trade over decades and the nexus between politicians and militancy.  The Bharatiya Janata Party-led (BJP-led) government of Manipur, under Chief Minister N Biren Singh, who is a Meitei, has launched a controversial ""war on drugs"" campaign targeting farming of poppy. Since 2017, the government claims to have destroyed more than 18,000 acres of poppy fields, the majority of them in Kuki-inhabited areas. (Manipur has battled a drug-addiction crisis and is among four north-eastern Indian states bordering Myanmar, the world's second-largest opium producer.) Mr Singh's campaign appears to have exacerbated divisions between a section of Kukis and the government. He has cautioned that villages growing poppy - mostly Kuki homelands - would be derecognised and stripped of welfare benefits.  In March, he told a news channel that his government had gone all out against ""some Kukis who were encroaching everywhere, protected forests, reserved forests, doing poppy plantations and doing drugs business"". The same month, Kukis held mass protests in hill districts against what they called the BJP government's ""selective targeting"" of the community. Mr Singh's government accused Kuki insurgent groups of inciting the community.  There is also a lot of pressure on land in Manipur - about 60% of the population lives on just 10% of the state's land in Imphal, a valley. The Meiteis resent the fact that they and other non-tribal people are not allowed to buy land or settle in the hill districts. They also want to prevent unrestricted entry of ""outsiders"" - settlers from neighbouring countries like Bangladesh and Myanmar - whose numbers they believe have sharply risen over the years.  A Kuki tradition of migrating across extensive territories - as land ownership exclusively passes down to the eldest son of the village chief - has led to new villages being set up by other male members of the family and put further pressure on land.  ""This mistrust between people here has been weaponised,"" Ms Nepram says. ""Rather than putting out the conflict, small ethnic groups have been armed and trained by Delhi [to fight insurgency] over decades as well as by those who are into guns, drugs and human trafficking."" That's not all. There's a dispute over two hills in the state, with conflicting claims of ownership from the Meiteis and Kukis. The Meiteis regard the hills as sacred, whereas the Kukis perceive the land beneath the hills as their ancestral territory which is facing encroachment.  ""For the past five years there has been growing animosity and anger between the two communities, some related to indigenous faith and practices and others related to encroachment,"" says Bhagat Oinam of Jawaharlal Nehru University. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been criticised for maintaining a studied silence on the violence. The majority of ministers and legislators from the governing BJP have gathered in Delhi, the capital, to devise strategies for resolving and managing the situation.  Kukis have demanded Delhi impose direct rule, and sought a separate administration for the community, a demand that carries the potential for backlash from the Nagas, who might also pursue a similar demand. ""Let us live in peace in our own land with our own people. Let us rule ourselves. After what has happened that is how we define peace,"" says Mary Haokip of the Indigenous Tribal Leaders Forum and a Kuki.  Ten of the 60 elected lawmakers in Manipur's assembly are Kukis, as are three ministers in Mr Singh's 10-member cabinet. ""There exists some political and administrative connection between the two communities. However, the growing alienation between them seems to be driving them further apart,"" says Kaybie Chongloi, a Kuki journalist.  The lack of trust has resulted in a significant divide, leaving lawmakers and ministers from the ruling party, representing both communities, unable to find common ground. ""This is not only a civil war but also a [fight] against the government,"" says Alex Jamkothang, a Kuki villager who lost his brother in the violence, in an interview with BBC Hindi. Giving autonomy to tribal groups could be a way to defuse the crisis, says Subir Bhaumik, author of Insurgent Crossfire: North-East India. He cites the example of the north-eastern state of Tripura where a third of the population are recognised as tribespeople and collectively govern two-thirds of the state's land area through an 'autonomous district council'. Others like Ms Nepram seek a Truth and Reconciliation Commission, including panels for reparations for homes burnt and lives lost in the conflict. Still others fear that Manipur will degenerate into a full-blown civil war unless there is a serious initiative for an ""inter-faith, inter-ethnic dialogue"". ""Nothing of this sort is being attempted,"" Mr Bhaumik says.  Clearly, peace in Manipur has always been precarious. Much of the peace in recent years was not organic, says Mr Sadokpam. ""It was what we call an imposed peace in a heavily militarised zone."" For the moment, there appears to be no light at the end of the tunnel as both sides appear to be digging in for a long confrontation. People remember clashes between Nagas and Kukis in the early 1990s which dragged on for a year before ebbing.  ""I don't think this is going to end soon. This will go on until both sides get fatigued - or one side gains dominance,"" says a senior government functionary in Imphal, who refused to be named. ""This is going to be a long haul.""

Volatility,Firmus raises gas price by further 38% in NI towns,2024-09-25,2021-11-11,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-59233950,"Firmus Energy is putting gas prices up by 38% from 3 December across its Ten Towns network area. The company said rising global energy costs had ""forced"" its hand to put prices up for the third time this year. Firmus gas prices increased by 35% in October and by 18% earlier in the year. The move will affect about 55,000 customers in the Ten Towns area, which includes Antrim, Armagh, Ballymena, Coleraine, Craigavon, Londonderry and Newry. The Consumer Council said the increase would mean the annual bill of a typical household will rise by about £268 a year or £255 a year for those with a prepayment meter. Firmus customers in Greater Belfast and in the Gas to the West network area will not be affected by the tariff change. Firmus chairman Dr David Dobbin said: ""This is a not a Firmus issue but a challenge faced by every local and national supplier of gas and electricity all of whom, sooner or later, will have to further increase their prices to meet the huge upsurges which have taken place in wholesale energy costs. ""We know this is an unwelcome increase, which will have a disproportionate effect on those of our customers who are the most vulnerable."" Firmus said it would be introducing a support scheme to offer targeted help to those most in need, which would open at about the same time as the increase takes effect. Wholesale costs make up 50% of customers' gas bills, which is why global increases have such a big effect locally. Rising gas prices this year come in stark contrast to last year's low prices, which were described by one economist at the time as a ""consumer sweet-spot"". The Utility Regulator has warned that high prices are likely to continue throughout the first half of next year. Some analysts have warned the volatility could last for between 18 to 36 months while others have suggested that the short answer is: we don't really know. One thing most are agreed on is that while prices will come down they aren't likely to fall by as much as they have risen. There are only two gas suppliers in Northern Ireland, which is why the Utility Regulator has to agree any price increase before it is passed on to customers. The regulator caps suppliers' profits at 2%. Natasha Toman is a mum of four in Craigavon, County Armagh, and is a Firmus customer worried about what the price rise will mean for her. ""This is two price rises in such a short space of time - it's going to be a tough winter,"" she said. ""I topped my card up with the maximum amount, which is £49, before 1 October so I would be getting it at the cheaper rate and now it is going up again. ""We don't have the luxury to change suppliers - there is only Firmus in this area. ""So you just have to get on with it and make the money stretch but it's tough going and it's going to be cutting in other areas as your home needs to be warm, particularly with four young children."" The Utility Regulator has capped the amount of profit gas providers can make at about 2%. But it has no control over wholesale energy costs, which is one of the key reasons for the price rises. So although a company's profit is capped that doesn't stop prices going up as the cost of commodities increases. The actual cost of the energy makes up about half of our bills and the rest goes to the companies that manage the pipes and to cover other expenses. So if the price of energy goes up the amount companies have to charge to make that 2% profit also increases. Read more: Why are energy bills going up? Eddie Lynch, the commissioner for older people, said there was a ""real growing fear"" among elderly people about the increasing cost of household bills. More than 50,000 pensioners in Northern Ireland are living in poverty, he said. ""What really concerns me is the perfect storm our older people are facing with higher energy bills and on top of that they have less opportunities to get out of the house because there are a lot less social activities since Covid hit,"" said the commissioner. ""That's how many of them actually managed their energy bills in the past - it was about getting out of the house so they didn't have to put the heat on. ""We're now at a stage where people have to spend much more time at home and are faced with huge bills coming down the line."" Ulster Unionist assembly member Andy Allen said the Stormont executive had to intervene ""swiftly and robustly"" to deal with the winter cost-of-living crisis. This month he put a motion before the assembly asking members to create a winter energy emergency fund - it was passed unanimously. ""We welcome the confirmation from the minister for communities that she will be bidding for the entirety of the £13.7m derived from UK Vulnerable Households fund in order to try and bring forward a support package,"" Mr Allen told BBC News NI. ""We need to see this in days, weeks - not months, not after Christmas. People on the ground need this now."" He said that charities were already having to support people in topping up gas and electric meters. The Utility Regulator, which regulates the suppliers in the market, had warned that substantial rises in the price of gas were coming. Its chief executive John French said: ""Unfortunately over the last six months we have seen unparalleled increases in the cost of wholesale energy at a global level. ""If wholesale prices begin to reduce our system of regulation in Northern Ireland allows us to act to make sure that reductions are fully passed onto consumers as quickly as possible."" Sinn Féin MLA Caoimhe Archibald said the UK government should remove VAT on energy bills, cutting the costs by 5%. Democratic Unionist Party MP Carla Lockhart said anyone who was struggling with their bills should check whether they were eligible for the universal credit benefit."
Volatility,Pay squeeze bites but unemployment dips,2024-09-25,2017-11-15,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-41996505,"Wages continue to lag behind the cost of living in the UK, while unemployment remains at a 42-year low. Workers' earnings, excluding bonuses, rose 2.2% in the three months to September compared with a year ago, the Office for National Statistics said. But they fell 0.5% in real terms when accounting for inflation, marking seven months of negative pay growth. The number of jobless - people not in work but seeking a job - fell 59,000 to 1.42 million during the period. With inflation at a five-and-a-half-year high of 3% in October, pay is failing to keep up with higher prices. The unemployment rate remained steady at 4.3% - its lowest rate since 1975 - and down from 4.8% a year earlier. Minister for Employment Damian Hinds said the unemployment figures showed the ""strength of the economy"". ""A near-record number of people are now in work,"" he said. ""Everyone should be given the opportunity to find work and enjoy the stability of a regular pay packet."" At the same time, the number of people in work dropped to 32 million, down 14,000 from the last quarter, according to ONS data. Labour MP Debbie Abrahams, shadow work and pensions secretary, said the figures were further evidence of ""Tory economic failure"".  She said: ""Both employment and real wages are falling while the price of household essentials balloons, leaving millions of people worse off than they were in 2010."" Matt Hughes, a senior ONS statistician, said employment had declined after two years of ""almost uninterrupted growth"", but was still higher than last year. The last time there was a bigger fall in employment was in April to June 2015, when the number of people in work dropped by 45,000, according to the ONS. The simultaneous drop in the number of workers and unemployed people is due to the rise in people who are classed as ""economically inactive"" - those not working and not seeking or available to work. This includes people studying, retirees, the long-term sick, or those looking after family, and rose by 117,000 to 8.8 million over the quarter.  Mr Hughes said: ""There was a rise in the number of people who were neither working nor looking for a job - so-called economically inactive people."" Separate ONS data showed a bright spot for productivity, which increased by 0.9% in the latest three months - the strongest growth rate for six years. But this follows a prolonged period of weak productivity since the financial crisis. By BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed: Any port in a storm, but it is sensible to put today's leap in productivity in context. After six months of negative figures (-0.5% January to March, -0.1% April to June), today's +0.9% jump in productivity is undoubtedly better news. But it would need at least two more quarters of similarly positive numbers to discern whether this is just normal quarter-by-quarter volatility or the first signs that the productivity slump might be starting to turn. The ONS measures productivity by dividing the number of hours worked by what is called Gross Value Added, the value of goods and services produced by the UK economy. It has leapt this quarter because working hours have fallen slightly and economic growth is higher. Whether we are actually producing more per hour worked - the key to wealth creation and better wages - will only become clear over the next six months. ONS head of productivity Philip Wales said: ""The medium-term picture continues to be one of productivity growing - but at a much slower rate than seen before the financial crisis."" The CBI's head of employment, Matthew Percival, thought the rise in productivity was ""encouraging"". He said: ""Businesses will be looking for the chancellor to cement progress in next week's Budget and maintain flexibility in the labour market, which remains a mainstay of the UK economy."" By BBC business correspondent Jonty Bloom: How can unemployment and the number of people in work drop at the same time?  The unemployment rate is a measure of those people who want to work - and cannot - but the employment rate is a measure of everyone in work.  So you could have a large number of people retiring and only some of them being replaced by unemployed people who are recruited to do their jobs.  Employment will fall, and so will unemployment.  In today's figures, the fall in employment seems to be concentrated amongst the 18-24 year olds, suggesting that part of the reason is that they are returning to education, although the figures are supposed to take such seasonal factors into account.

Volatility,"Petrol prices cannot be justified, says RAC",2024-09-25,2018-06-12,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44453931,"The RAC says the current petrol price is too high and cannot be justified. The motoring organisation is urging retailers to pass on recent falls in the wholesale cost of petrol. It says there is ""no good reason"" for keeping prices as high as they are and says petrol retailers should cut forecourt prices by 2p a litre. But a fuel retailers association said wholesale price and dollar volatility had added to pressures on independent petrol stations. Asda was the first major retailer to cut fuel prices following the RAC's claim. The supermarket giant said it had reduced the price of unleaded by up to 3p per litre and diesel by up to 2p. The new national price cap means drivers will pay no more than £1.25 per litre for unleaded and £1.28 for diesel at its 318 filling stations. The RAC says fuel prices have risen almost daily since the end of April, despite wholesale costs coming down by around 2.5p per litre since May 24. It says diesel prices have been rising for even longer, with supermarkets raising the price every single day since the 27 March. Average UK forecourt prices currently stand at £1.29 per litre for unleaded and £1.33 for diesel.  Motoring fuel prices are affected by the price of crude oil. As crude oil is priced in dollars, the exchange rate also plays a part. In May, there were record rises in the price of petrol, largely as a result of the oil price peaking at $80 and a weakening of sterling against the dollar. But since the end of last month the oil price has been falling, and so have wholesale fuel prices. RAC spokesperson Rod Dennis said: ""Our data shows that it's high time retailers cut the price of petrol and diesel at the pumps - we see no good reason for them to wait before passing on savings they are benefiting from which have been brought about by falling wholesale prices. ""Motorists really felt the impact of rising in prices in May, when the cost of filling up a petrol family car jumped by around £3.30 in a single month. We are now well into June, and drivers are still waiting for some relief to rising prices."" However, Brian Madderson, chairman of the Petrol Retailers Association, said: ""We are in the middle of one of the most volatile periods of wholesale price movements we have seen for some time."" He said the retailers will reduce prices if they think they can do, and are ""not going to price at an insult level"". However, Mr Madderson said that fluctuations in the dollar against sterling, plus requirements on retailers to add more biofuels to diesel and petrol, had helped push up prices. He added that he could only see petrol prices going up as volumes of sales fall due to the take-up of hybrid and electric cars as retailers try to maintain margins.

Volatility,What next in Scotland's housing market?,2024-09-25,2022-10-19,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-63320045,"As soaring price inflation, the prospect of recession and of a prolonged European war have closed in on the economy, the housing market appears to have bounced along merrily, as if oblivious. It's not as if they're linked to the price of oil, gas or food, which have driven inflation to 10.1% in the year to August.  The latest house price index, published on Wednesday, shows the average price paid for a Scottish home in August was 9.7% up on the same month last year.  That's down from the 11% rise in the year to July, and down from the 15.1% published a year ago. The English market has seen more volatility in price inflation, partly through the distorting effect of transaction tax holidays - used by the Treasury to stimulate the market as the country came out of recession. Prices in the year to August in England were up 14.3% - down from July's inflation rate of 16.8% - with the average price reaching £315,000. That figure is pulled up by London and the south-east, which have seen more subdued increases in recent years. Price inflation across the UK, with Wales also seeing some lively numbers, means that the average home has gained £36,000 in value over the past year - ahead of average pre-tax full-time earnings. Much of this has to do with the pandemic. The enforced shutdown of the market for parts of 2020 was followed by a burst of pent-up demand, driven by people who had realised during lockdown that they could do with more space. Many saved quite a lot during the pandemic, which they could put into a house purchase. Many also found they could live and work further from the office. So the price of a des res detached home with a bit of space in the country, especially near the coast, has risen fastest of all. The latest figures from Registers of Scotland show the price of a detached home is up by 13% to £349,000 on average, while flats were up 6.7% to £134,000. Aberdeen registered barely any increase, while other bigger cities were close to the national average. The council areas with the biggest increases were Argyll, Highland and the islands. East Lothian and the Borders have been hot spots for rising prices recently, but both saw more modest price increases in these latest figures.  There's a health warning with these figures, though, as they can be skewed by small numbers of transactions, and August can be a quiet month. The big driver of home price inflation in recent years has been the mismatch of supply and demand. Estate agents and surveyors note that there aren't enough homes coming on to the market while demand has remained higher.  When they are put up for sale, the blind bidding system usually used in Scotland is competitive.  To illustrate the point, I'll declare a personal interest: I recently sold my terraced house in Glasgow. There were 13 bidders, and it went for more than 30% above the home report valuation. That, incidentally, puzzles me as to the point or the meaning of a home report valuation. Last year saw the highest number of transactions since 2007, partly to catch up on the lower number in the first year of the pandemic. Registers of Scotland tells us that transaction numbers were down by more than a fifth in the year to June. And according to a specialist in the economics of the housing market, John Boyle at Rettie estate agents, that is at least as important a number to watch if we are to understand the market.  His preferred indicator of market health is the number of sales multiplied by the average price, and since the financial crash of 2008, that has been much lower than it was. Looking ahead, Mr Boyle is one of the market watchers who expects to see the broader economy closing in on house price inflation and dampening it, though not necessarily by driving prices down. That only happens where people are forced to sell - for instance due to divorce or a need to move home for work. What we've seen in recent years is that those who have to move, but cannot sell at the price they want, will often rent out and become tenants elsewhere.   And there's repossession due to mortgage default, which was a feature of past recessions. That is less likely now because affordability checks ahead of agreeing to lend have been much more stringent since 2008. Banks, or at least their regulator, are wary of the destabilising effect it can have on the economy. If homes don't have to be sold, that squeezes supply even further, and holds up prices. Mr Boyle says the mid-to-upper level market has continued to fare quite well, depending on cash buyers and those on secure, higher salaries.  Cash buyers have grown as a share of the market, to around a third. They have an advantage in bidding contests over those who have yet to secure a mortgage or have other houses to sell first. The lower-to-middle market is more exposed and dependent on mortgages. With monthly payments at exceptionally low levels since 2009, home prices adjusted upwards to affordability based on those low mortgage costs.  But as they rise - which they were bound to do eventually, but with the recent budget bùrach in Downing Street turbocharging them - they are making it more difficult to make that second or third step up.  The Registers of Scotland figures are accurate about transactions that have to be registered with that office, but they are backward looking. Deals closed in August were typically struck in spring, before it became clear that the economy was heading downhill. More up-to-date assessments of the market come from Halifax, part of the same group as Bank of Scotland. It says UK prices in the year to August were up 9.9% with inflation on a falling trend. Scotland's prices rose, but by 8.5%, falling from 9.3% inflation over the year. Rightmove, which has a strong grip on the property advertising market, reported that Scotland has seen 6.6% growth in prices in the past year, and it is taking an average 24 days to secure a sale. The UK increase for Rightmove is 7.8% and falling. It notes the recent political and interest rate turmoil has hit the first-time buyer market. Its report this week showed a drop in the number of such people engaged with buying, while those who have a mortgage offer are rushing to complete the purchase before interest rates rise further. The monthly market review by RICS, the surveyors organisation, is the best measure of what lies ahead. It reported buyer enquiries in Scotland have recently fallen for third consecutive month. While limited supply is still supporting a modest price rise, this looks set to end as the pace of house price inflation slows. Looking to the remaining weeks of this year, price and sales expectations are now slightly negative. That does not tell you how much prices or sales might fall - only that the number of upbeat surveyors is smaller than the downbeat ones. If this is a turning point in the market, what is a potential buyer to do? Wait to see if prices fall, or jump into the market in case mortgage costs rise further?  There's no simple answer. It depends on circumstances, of where you are, how long you can stay there, where you want to be, and how you intend to finance it."
Volatility,Concert venue revamp costs soar again to £132m,2024-09-25,2023-01-17,By Adam Postans,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-bristol-64302085,"The cost of a concert venue revamp has risen by another £25m, almost three times the original estimate.  The refurbishment of the Bristol Beacon was initially expected to cost £48m but that figure is now likely to reach £132m.  The council's cabinet is set to approve the increased bill from additional borrowing to be paid back over the next 50 years. It follows a doubling of costs for the project less than two years ago. A report to the council states that the building sits on a constrained site and has suffered from a lack of maintenance and modernisation with no major refurbishment for 60 years. The council-owned building, formerly known as the Colston Hall, is already valued at zero in the authority's accounts. Bristol City Council has also written off £69m on the project - a figure expected to rise to £93m - because of payments due to contractor Willmott Dixon. But papers for next week's cabinet meeting reveal that the alternatives to continuing the refurbishment would be even more expensive and cause the reopening to be delayed by years ""due to unprecedented volatility and uncertainty in the construction sector"". Of the three options considered ploughing on with the scheme - with the aim of welcoming audiences again this autumn - will cost £131.9m. Pausing the revamp and restarting in 12 months would increase that to £165m, while stopping the work altogether and making the building safe would need more than £200m. So officers are recommending that cabinet takes the ""least risk, least cost option"" and completes the project. Follow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Volatility,'I lost millions through cryptocurrency trading addiction',2024-09-25,2021-05-28,By Jonathan Peters,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-57268024,"Jake lost millions of pounds trading cryptocurrencies. He does not want his identity known because he is still in treatment at one of the only hospitals in the UK that treats people who are obsessed with gambling on the value of the virtual currency. Jake first bought Bitcoin - the most popular cryptocurrency - in 2015, but it was not until a big win a few years later that his trading spiralled out of control.  ""I can pinpoint the exact moment it became a problem,"" he said. ""I had been eroding the sum I put aside, but I entered a trade, and I was willing to risk that last amount I had. ""I ended up making back pretty much everything I lost in a single trade. The feeling was one of absolute euphoria."" Jake told BBC Scotland's The Nine that this high, coupled with difficulties in his marriage and personal life, quickly led to an addictive cycle. His job at that time meant he was in charge of millions of pounds. He said that he soon took to trading money that was not his in the hope of repeating his first success.  He said: ""The first time I took it, I lost it all in about 20 minutes one night. The market moved very rapidly and I liquidated everything. ""It was about 2am. I went back to bed and had to lie down next to my wife. She had no idea what I had been up to."" Jake had been facing criminal charges for embezzlement but was able to pay back £1.5m to his employer with the help of his family and is now in treatment for his addiction. Cryptocurrencies are digital money that is not issued by a bank. You can trade and invest these currencies like any other - and there are virtually no barriers to entry. The absence of regulation means the market can go up incredibly fast.  During the lockdown, the total value of all cryptocurrencies increased from about £175bn to more than £1.75tn.  Figures from the UK's financial watchdog show that hundreds of thousands of people in the UK hold these digital currencies.  But since the start of May, the market reached its highest-ever level and lost more than £1tn just a few weeks later.  With something this volatile, when you win, you win big. When you lose, you hit rock bottom.  According to experts, cryptocurrency trading addicts show the same kind of behavioural addictions as problem gamblers. There are no figures for the number of people addicted to cryptocurrency trading but Tony Marini, the lead counsellor at the cryptocurrency addiction clinic at Castle Craig hospital in Peebles, said they are seeing more and more people in Scotland. ""This is the crack cocaine of gambling because it is so fast,"" he said. ""It's 24/7. It's on your phone, your laptop, it's in your bedroom."" The clinic has treated more than 100 people for cryptocurrency addictions in the past few years. It is the combination of constant availability and extreme volatility that leads people to his door, Mr Marini said.  ""There are so many people out there that are trading cryptocurrency that are making money,"" he said. ""And they're telling everyone that they're making money. We are not hearing from the people that are losing money."" It is not just the market that can cause problems. The technology that enables cryptocurrencies is notoriously complicated, and if you are not careful, you could easily find yourself investing in a scam. When Jen McAdam's father died a few years ago, she was still working in IT.  She heard about what she thought was a once-in-a-lifetime investment opportunity, which turned out to be a scam. ""My friends and family invested,"" she said. ""Collectively, our total loss so far has been over 250,000 euros (£215,000).  ""You carry horrendous guilt, shame, regret. You're just in a place of devastation."" Jen wants people to know the risks of investing in these assets, and warns those who do not understand the technology to stay away. ""If you want to invest, and you don't have any knowledge, you're gambling,"" she said. ""You are taking a very high risk."" For some, the investment has paid off. Cameron has seen an amazing turnaround in his fortunes. As a freelance musician, opportunities have been few and far between this past year. He can sum up how lockdown affected him in one word. ""Devastating,"" he said.  ""Gigs came to an end, schools closed, all my sources of income completely vanished,"" Cameron said.  When lockdown hit in March last year, he saw the market for cryptocurrencies was growing, and he decided to invest.  One year on, and in an otherwise difficult economy, he now has things to be cheerful about.  He said: ""It's been a really great year of these assets increasing in value to the point where, at least for the short-term, I'm not going to have any financial worries. ""If I could have told myself last year that I'd have this sort of reserve, I don't know what I'd think. ""It's been such a relief."""
Volatility,"Mine e-waste, not the Earth, say scientists",2024-09-25,2022-05-07,By Victoria Gill,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-61350996,"The recycling of e-waste must urgently be ramped up because mining the Earth for precious metals to make new gadgets is unsustainable, scientists say. One study estimated that the world's mountain of discarded electronics, in 2021 alone, weighed 57 million tonnes.  The Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC) says there now needs to be a global effort to mine that waste, rather than mining the Earth.  Global conflicts also pose a threat to supply chains for precious metals.  The RSC is running a campaign to draw attention to the unsustainability of continuing to mine all the precious elements used in consumer technology. It points out that geopolitical unrest, including the war in Ukraine, has caused huge spikes in the price of materials like nickel, a key element in electric vehicle batteries.  This volatility in the market for elements is causing ""chaos in supply chains"" that enable the production of electronics. Combined with the surge in demand, this caused the price of lithium - another important component in battery technology - to increase by almost 500% between 2021 and 2022.  Current reserves of some key elements, researchers say, are simply running out.  ""Our tech consumption habits remain highly unsustainable and have left us at risk of exhausting the raw elements we need,"" said Prof Tom Welton, president of the Royal Society of Chemistry, adding that those habits were ""continuing to exacerbate environmental damage"". All the while, the amount of e-waste generated is growing by about two million tonnes every year. Less than 20% is collected and recycled. ""We need governments to overhaul recycling infrastructure and tech businesses to invest in more sustainable manufacturing,"" said Prof Welton.  New research by the RSC also revealed a growing demand from consumers for more sustainable technology. In an online survey of 10,000 people across 10 countries, 60% said they would be more likely to switch to a rival of their preferred tech brand if they knew the product was made in a sustainable way. The survey also suggested that people did not know how to deal with their own e-waste. Many respondents said they worried about the environmental effect of unused devices they have in their homes, but did not know what to do with them or were concerned about the security of recycling schemes. Elizabeth Ratcliffe from the Royal Society of Chemistry, told BBC Radio 4's inside Science that many of us were ""unwittingly stockpiling precious metals in our homes"", in old phones and defunct computers.  ""Manufacturers and retailers need to take more responsibility,"" said Ms Ratcliffe. ""Like 'take-back' schemes, meaning people can return their electronics to a retailer and be assured they will be recycled securely. ""All this volatility in supply chains really just reinforces the fact that we need a circular economy for these materials. At the moment, we're just mining them out of the ground constantly.""  The society hopes to encourage people to take old and unwanted devices to recycling centres, rather than stuff them into drawers and forget about them. It points UK consumers to online resources where they can find the nearest centre that pledges to recycle computers, phones and other devices securely.  ""The thing we always say is reduce, reuse and recycle. So perhaps keep a phone for longer and maybe sell an old phone or give it to a relative,"" says Ms Ratcliffe. ""It will need everyone working together to scale up these processes and put the infrastructure in place, so we can all recycle our devices.""  Follow Victoria on Twitter"
Volatility,Five pricey cities you can now afford,2024-09-25,2017-06-21,Unknown,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20170605-living-in-cities-that-are-cheaper-than-ever,"With global forces and political influences in flux, certain destinations that have long been some of the world’s most expensive have recently seen a shift in cost of living. A rise in global nationalism paired with a worldwide drop in oil prices has brought about significant shifts in the global economy over the past year. As a result of these developments, certain destinations that have long been some of the world’s most expensive have recently seen a decrease in their cost of living. Whether due to international politics, export and import changes or currency swings, cities like London – which recently voted to depart the EU in the Brexit vote – have seen their ranking dramatically drop in the Economist Intelligence Unit’s annual Cost of Living Index. And, since local currency values have fallen against foreign currencies in most cases (and the rate of local inflation often rises sharply), it’s expats employed by foreign companies that are likely to see the most benefit in these cost-of-living changes. We talked to residents and expats living in these places to find out how the changes have affected them, and how to save the most money in these suddenly affordable destinations. London The 2016 Brexit vote in favour of Britain leaving the European Union had an immediate negative impact on the pound as compared to other currencies. So much so that London, long at the top of the cost-of-living index, dropped 18 places in just a year. International tourists have flocked to the country to snag deals on luxury goods and other shopping; one estimate said foreign spending has surged more than 36% year-on-year.  But since foreign currencies are stronger against the pound, the cost of imported goods have gone up in price, said Ian Wright, founder of international mover company MoverDB.com, adding that “or more sneakily, the size has been reduced”. (Though the company denies a Brexit association, Toblerone changed the shape of their chocolate bars shortly after the vote). Experts predict that important imports like fruits and vegetables will also likely rise around 8% as a result of Brexit. Still there are plenty of ways to live even more affordably – and finding good deals on housing is top of the list. Generally, living in south and east London is cheaper than the west or north. “London is really quite strange in that you can have council estates located right next to multi-million pound homes,” said Wright, originally from Canada.  Wright lives in Abbey Wood in southeast London, where he says a house can be rented from around £1,000 a month, or purchased for around £325,000. “While the area doesn't have a lot going on today, the ruins of the 12th-Century Lesnes Abbey and many parks and woods nearby can be wandered and enjoyed for free,” he said. Other affordable options include more centrally located Leyton near Olympic Park in east London, and East Ham just south of Leyton. East Croydon in south London is also being extensively redeveloped and will soon have a new shopping centre – but you can still find a rental from just £500 per month. While the UK in general has taken on something of an anti-immigrant mood, according to Wright, he assures that the capital is still very open and multicultural. “London has far fewer ethnic enclaves than cities in the US so you get expats and immigrants from all over the world living next to each other, which I think is one of the best things about the city,” he said. Beijing Many Chinese cities dropped more than 10 places in this year’s rankings, including Beijing which dropped 16 places. While the report didn’t speculate on causes, sources have attributed the drop to falling demand for Chinese exports and a decreased value of the yuan against the dollar. Much like in London, being able to live comfortably depends on how far from the city centre you’re willing to live: a one-bedroom in Tongzhou, 22km east of the city centre, rents for only RMB 2,500 per month. “But your best bet as a foreigner is finding a room a bit closer to the centre for around RMB 4,000, which you can pretty much do in the ‘cool’ parts of town near Sanlitun [9km northeast from the centre] and Gulou [5km north of the centre],” said Om Buffalo, an American who currently lives in Beijing. In general, south and west Beijing are cheaper than the north and east. Other ways to save money include taking the subway instead of taxis. “For medium to long-distance trips, taking a taxi in Beijing often takes longer and costs way more than the subway,” said Josh Ong, director of global marketing and communications at Beijing-based Cheetah Mobile. “It's a little daunting at first, especially during rush hour, but with a little research, you can learn your way around.” His other suggestion is to eat like a local, using dianping.com to find the places real Beijingers are dining. “Western food in Beijing comes at a premium, but there are amazing noodle shops and dumpling houses just around the corner from you.” Lagos Nigeria’s largest city also dropped 16 spots in the rankings, due to global dropping oil prices, one of the country’s primary exports. This may be helpful for foreign employees, but Hashim Zein, an ambassador for expat community InterNations and originally from the US, says that this may create additional security challenges as the related currency inflation has driven prices up for locals, which can lead to an increase in theft and related crimes. A little common sense goes a long way, however, say locals, and it shouldn’t stop anyone from living here. “I feel at home in Nigeria because of the attitude of the people here. A can-do spirit and resilience plus always time to make merry no matter what,” Zein said. Plus, the city knows how to have a good time. “There’s no party like a Lagos party – seven days a week!”     Lagos is separated into two major parts – the Mainland and Island (which is actually multiple islands, but is separated from the mainland by the Lagos Lagoon). Most expats live on the Island part, including the affluent Victoria Island neighbourhood, 17km south of the city centre and part of the larger Lekki peninsula; or equally high-end Ikoyi, an island neighbourhood, located 15km south of the city centre, built for British expats during colonial rule. Nearby Lekki Phase, a brand-new city still in development, is also just a few more kilometres further down the island. Those who work in manufacturing are more likely to need to be on the mainland, and Ilupeju (8km north of the centre) and Ikeja (15km north) are some of the best areas for expats, according to Zein, for their safety, more stable infrastructure and location close to many businesses. Mexico City Ranked 82 of 132 cities in 2017, Mexico City has always been relatively affordable – but also dropped nine places in the rankings this year. As the currency becomes weaker compared to foreign currency, inflation has risen and local prices have gone up slightly, including recently increased bus fares due to the gasolinazo, the higher gas prices that have been the source of city-wide protests. For that reason, it’s better to walk to the metro than take the bus, said Lauren Cocking, originally from London who writes a Mexico travel blog. And while she relies on public transportation over private transportation, she recommends Uber for late-night needs. “It is often cheaper than taxis and far safer than public transport, especially late at night.” It’s also easy to save money by shopping in the tianguis (local markets) than the big supermarkets. “The price difference is incredible,” Cocking said. “The food is my favourite part of life here.” She says that most expats flock to the neighbourhoods of Roma and Condesa, but those may not necessarily give a good representative feel for the city. “My recommendations would lean more towards underrated neighbourhoods like Narvarte or Del Valle [7.5km and 9km south of the city respectively],” she said. “They are more ‘local', residential areas, and not as at risk from earthquake damage. Same goes for neighbourhoods in the south of the city, such as Copilco and Coyoacán [15km and 12.5km south of the city].” “Coyoacán is a beautiful, colonial neighbourhood with more traditional houses and relaxing parks and quiet streets, and a bustling central plaza full of delicious street food and entertainment,” said Natalie B, a Mexico City native who works for local travel guide company My Local Cousin. “For those preferring a more traditional Mexican experience in a mostly residential setting, La Narvarte is a good option. This neighbourhood was built up in the 1940s through ‘70s and still has a lot of great original architecture, quiet streets and a family atmosphere.” Buenos Aires After London, Buenos Aires saw the greatest fall in the index, dropping 20 places due to Argentina’s economic volatility. Locals are used to these kind of price fluctuations though, says Madi Lang, an American who has lived in the city for 10 years and runs the Buenos Aires Cultural Concierge. “The economy is always pretty crazy,” she said. “They take it all in their stride – as long as there is beef for the grill.” Lola Black, a tango guide and an InterNations ambassador, describes the city as “urban, but effortlessly cool and Euro-Latin laid back”. To get the most of this vibe, expats should consider living in Puerto Madero, 4km southeast of the city centre, a clean, high-end part of the city close to the ocean, or historic San Telmo, 4km south of the centre (though safety is a higher concern here). Those in the city for its famous tango should live in centrally located Almagro, 6km west of downtown. “It's the perfect 'hood because it's super central. It’s close to the touristy/trendy area of Palermo and with excellent access to downtown,” Lang said. “Right in this area there are bars, restaurants, milongas (tango halls), live music joints and just real neighbourhood life.” Plenty of free activities and parks also make the city very affordable for entertainment. “The hundreds of plazas and parks are perfect for spending the afternoon drinking mate (our traditional tea drink), people watching and general relaxation,” Lang said. Her personal favourites are Plaza Vicente Lopez in Recoleta, the Rosedal Rode Garden in Parque 3 de Febrero and Parque Lezama in San Telmo.

Volatility,US lawmakers to question crypto executives,2024-09-25,2021-12-02,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-59496509,"Executives of eight major cryptocurrency firms have been called to testify before a US congressional committee on 8 December.  Witnesses called to appear include Coinbase's Alesia Haas, Circle's Jeremy Allaire and Bitfury's Brian Brooks. It will be the first time companies representing the controversial sector have been questioned in this way. US politicians across the political spectrum have called for more scrutiny of crypto-currencies. Elizabeth Warren on the left of the Democratic Party has called for tougher regulation of the sector and Donald Trump has described crypto-currencies as ""a scam"".  Mr Brooks of Bitfury previously served as a top banking regulator under the Trump administration and had a role in policy-making around crypto-currencies. Crypto-currencies are not currencies in the traditional sense, although they can sometimes be used to make payments. They are stored online in a ""digital wallet"" and act more like investment vehicles or securities, often with a high degree of volatility. The anonymity of paying using crypto-currencies means they have been favoured for criminal activities such as drug dealing and ransomware attacks. However their supporters say the view that they are predominantly for circumventing the law is outdated and that innovation in this area offers huge potential. Countries around the world have taken radically different approaches to crypto-currencies. China has declared crypto-currency transactions illegal, a move India looks set to follow. Many other central banks are eyeing the sector warily and discussing regulation. However El Salvador recently declared Bitcoin - the most widely established crypto-currency - to be legal tender and its president plans to build a Bitcoin city at the base of a volcano, with the cryptocurrency used to fund the project. Across the US, as well as many private citizens holding crypto-currencies, states and municipalities have begun toying with plans to integrate them into their operations.  The mayor of Miami and mayor elect of New York have ambitions to make their cities centres for cryptocurrency business. The hearing before the US House Financial Services Committee will focus on ""the challenges and benefits of financial innovation"", according to the committee announcement. The other chief executives who have been asked to appear are Sam Bankman-Fried of FTX Trading, Chad Cascarilla of Paxos and Dennelle Dixon of the Stellar Development Foundation."
Volatility,Alderney keeps electricity costs below price cap,2024-09-25,2022-05-11,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4n23de6r6go,"The price of electricity in Alderney remains below the 50p price cap, utility bosses  have confirmed. Alderney Electricity Ltd (AEL) said although the cost of fuel had increased, it would keep the price of a unit of electricity below the 50p per unit price cap for islanders. AEL raised the price of fuel and electricity in May 2022, but introduced an electricity fuel cost relief for customers for three months from 1 May.  Managing director James Lancaster said its latest shipment had ""risen significantly"". He said: “As anticipated, the cost of fuel received in the latest shipment has risen significantly as a result of recent world events and the volatility of the global fuels market. ""The fuel cost component is now 24.46p, which would have raised the price of a unit of electricity on the A tariff above the 50p price cap.

Volatility,Cost of Manx ferry terminal in Liverpool unclear,2024-09-25,2023-05-03,Alex Wotton,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpvxnpk2x17o,"The final cost of the Isle of Man's new ferry terminal in Liverpool is currently unknown, the infrastructure minister has said. Chris Thomas said while the terminal building was on track to be finished by late May or early June, the marine works would take longer.  They ""continued to present challenges due to the testing environment"", he said. The cost of the Manx government-funded project, which was originally due to be completed by 2020, has already increased from £38m to £70m. Mr Thomas was asked for an update on the facility at the Princes Half Tide Dock in the House of Keys this week. He refused to confirm a specific completion date, or a final cost of the project, which has almost doubled since the project began. However, he said about 70% of the scour protection work in the river, designed to limit damage to the quay walls caused by vessels, had been completed. Costs have spiralled in the last four years after the scheme was beset with delays. Mr Thomas said following initial setbacks due to the coronavirus pandemic, the project had more recently been hit by ""inflation and fuel cost volatility"".  That had not been anticipated when additional funding was sought in December 2021, he said. He said the Department of Infrastructure was ""working through these costs with the project team"" and it would ""not be appropriate to suggest the final figure at this stage"".  Jason Moorhouse MHK was concerned that there was 30% of the overall project still to complete within ""several months"", when 70% had taken ""several years"". Mr Thomas said: ""I remain optimistic that the current planned completion date of Autumn 2023 will be complied with."" That was ""despite all the challenges of the weather and the Mersey"", he added.

Volatility,Click Energy set to up electricity prices by 16%,2024-09-25,2021-09-09,By Richard Morgan,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-58505592,"Click Energy is increasing electricity prices by 16% from 1 October, according to the Consumer Council.  The rise affects customers on a variable rate tariff and is expected to increase the average bill by about £100 a year. The company is the latest energy provider to announce price hikes.  On Wednesday, Firmus energy announced a 35% increase on gas tariffs in the Ten Towns Network, to take effect from the same date. SSE Airtricity customers will also see a price rise from October. The Consumer Council said it was the second increase by Click Energy this month.  A 9% price rise came into effect on 1 September.   Raymond Gormley, Consumer Council head of energy policy, said the news would ""adversely impact all Click Energy customers already experiencing financial pressures on their household budget especially considering it is the second increase by the supplier in one month"". ""Any consumers who are experiencing financial difficulty and are struggling with their energy bills should contact Click Energy to find out how they can help during this time. The Consumer Council said it would encourage all consumers to shop around to get the best energy deal.  ""Click Energy have stated that there will be no exit fee applied to customers who switch supplier before 30 September 202,"" he said.  A spokesperson for Click Energy said the wholesale energy market was experiencing ""unprecedented volatility with prices at all-time record highs for extended periods of time"".   ""This unparalleled environment means that energy suppliers have to make difficult decisions which unfortunately negatively impact consumers."""
Volatility,"Sun, stars and saliva - the Cannes 2021 highlights",2024-09-25,2021-07-16,By Helen Bushby,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-57864015,"The Cannes Film Festival is drawing to a close, and despite the pandemic it managed to gather a larger number film stars in the sunshine for the obligatory photo opportunities.  This distinctive line-up of director Wes Anderson and actors Timothee Chalamet, Tilda Swinton and Bill Murray for their film The French Dispatch proved irresistible as a meme.  Jessica Shortall described the line-up as ""Tiktok-LinkedIn-Instagram-Twitter"", while Philip Bump dubbed them ""Z, X, Millennial, Boomer"". Sara Wallace Goodman spoke for many of us when she described the stars' fashions as: ""Zoom presentation attire, remembering how I dressed before Zoom, imagining how I'll dress after Zoom, how I'll actually dress after Zoom."" That picture became one of the viral moments from the prestigious festival, but there were plenty of other talking points. The Covid safety procedures included saliva tests for those outside the EU's Covid tracking system. In other words, attendees had to dispense with any delusions of glamour and spit into a pot. The Wrap's Ben Croll wrote that booking a test was ""painless enough"", but ""the process of generating enough saliva, however, requires a bit more finesse"" - describing being handed a vial to fill, which was checked for quality and quantity.  The Guardian's Xan Brooks said a medic sternly told him: ""Only the liquid is good. The froth doesn't count.""  Vulture's Nate Jones added that the French event had ""become an odyssey of spit"", while Variety's Ramin Setoodeh described ""audible sighs of frustration among those waiting in line when they realised just how much saliva the lab needed from them"".  Hollywood actor Matt Damon and Call My Agent's Camille Cottin added some star wattage for Stillwater, which got a five-minute standing ovation.  Variety's executive editor Ramin Setoodeh said Damon was brought to tears by the applause. He plays an American oil rig roughneck who travels to Marseille to visit his estranged daughter, who is in prison for a murder she says she did not commit.  IndieWire's Anne Thompson said Todd McCarthy's film got ""solid"" early reviews and that the director ""effectively draws the audience into this shut-down man's dawning awareness of an emotional life beyond the confines of Oklahoma oilfields"". Empire's Ian Freer said the film ""mashes up quest-for-justice, father-daughter dramatics, fortysomething romance and mid-life introspection for a refreshingly adult drama"". The Spectator's Stephen Arnell said this year's festival was ""a bumper event with a wealth of backlogged movies on offer for film-starved cineastes"", with Val - a documentary chronicling the highs, lows and cancer battle of US actor Kilmer - as his top pick. He also highlighted the musical Annette, which opened the festival, but suggested it would be ""something of a Marmite experience for cinema-goers"". It stars Adam Driver as edgy comedian Henry, married to renowned soprano Ann (Marion Cotillard), with a newborn daughter Annette who is actually a puppet with strange abilities. Variety's Richard Lawson called the film ""daring and garish"", but Screen Daily's Jonathan Romney said it was ""an audacious folly that comes across as grandiose and joyless"". Tatler's Danielle Lawler also recommended Annette along with The French Dispatch, which she called an ""ensemble of epic proportions"" with a cast that also includes Willem Dafoe, Frances McDormand and Saoirse Ronan. She called the film, which is based on a collection of short stories originally published in The French Dispatch magazine, ""a dreamy blockbuster for these times"". Flag Day, directed by Sean Penn and starring the actor alongside his daughter Dylan and son Hopper, was also highlighted. It is based on a young woman's relationship with her father, who she discovers led a double life as a conman. The Hollywood Reporter's David Rooney said it ""succumbs to Penn's worst indulgences, loading up on big actor-ish explosions of volatility rather than trying to get to the lost soul of a desperate man and the yearning of a daughter"".  But Deadline's Pete Hammond added that it would be ""remembered as a dazzling showcase for the acting talents of his daughter"". Regardless of what is happening on screen, there will always be more interest in what's happening on the red carpet.  Actress Sharon Stone wore a Dolce & Gabbana dress bedecked in flowers for the screening of The Story of My Wife, about a sea captain who makes a bet in a cafe with a friend that he will marry the first woman who walks in.  Stone's co-star Lea Seydoux was unable to attend because she contracted Covid, so Stone, a veteran of the Cannes red carpet, having attended for Basic Instinct in 1992, made the most of the limelight. She was variously described as stunning, dazzling and stealing the show in the most beautiful dress at Cannes."
Volatility,Scots insolvencies up 46% in six months,2024-09-25,2019-08-04,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-49229153,"The number of companies in Scotland declared insolvent has risen by 46% in six months, according to new analysis. KPMG said economic volatility is behind the trend, with Brexit creating uncertainty for businesses. The professional services firm advised businesses to plan for worst-case scenarios and be fiscally cautious. It said there were 698 corporate insolvency appointments between January and June, up from 479 in the previous six months. Of the 698 cases, the vast majority (661) involved a company liquidation, while 37 were administration and receivership appointments. The number of insolvencies in the quarter ending 30 June is similar to that of the same period the previous year. Blair Nimmo, KPMG head of restructuring, said: ""While there is clearly a trend towards an increase in corporate insolvencies, there are some signs of resilience. ""The last quarter has remained far more static and a number of industries are taking proactive measures to put themselves on a more stable financial footing, including retailers, hoping corporate voluntary arrangement proposals could head off the prospect of administration. ""The ongoing Brexit discussions and change of Prime Minister and Cabinet have undoubtedly create a climate of uncertainty but there are wider challenges at play, creating a toxic mix of issues for businesses going through a period of distress."" He added: ""The best approach for any business in Scotland right now is to maintain a fiscally cautious approach, ensuring you maximise reserves, proactively and regularly review contingency plans and - ultimately - plan for any worst case scenarios. ""A number of challenges could be on the horizon, but with a resilient, focused approach, including taking appropriate advice at an early stage, Scotland's business community can continue to grow sustainably in the long-term."""
Volatility,News Daily: Trump 'war games' pledge and Tory Brexit 'concessions' talks,2024-09-25,2018-06-13,By Justin Parkinson,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-44461360,"Hello. Here's your morning briefing: After his summit with North Korea's Kim Jong-un, Donald Trump promised to cancel his country's joint military exercises with South Korea. Now the Pentagon has moved to reassure US allies in eastern Asia that the president retains an ""ironclad"" commitment to maintaining security in the region. Mr Trump's announcement on so-called ""war games"" is seen as a large concession to Mr Kim, who - according to North Korean state media - has accepted an invitation to visit the US. Mr Trump, who called Mr Kim a ""funny guy"", has also been asked to come to Pyongyang. The biggest issue on the table - the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula - was also discussed, with Mr Kim confirming his ""unwavering commitment"" to it. Whatever happens, writes BBC North America reporter Anthony Zurcher, the summit - with all its odd moments - shows that US and international politics ""have been turned upside down"". Korea analyst Jenny Town looks at what has been achieved so far. Theresa May averted a Commons rebellion over plans to give MPs a ""meaningful"" say over a final Brexit deal with the EU. Now Conservative MPs are to discuss in further detail what their role will be if no agreement is reached with Brussels by December. Some MPs say they were offered real ""input"", in a last-minute concession ahead of a key vote on the EU Withdrawal Bill.  But Solicitor General Robert Buckland argued that allowing Parliament to ""instruct"" the government on what to do in the event of no deal would leave the UK in ""very rocky constitutional territory"". BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg says there have been ""very, very dark mutterings"" from those who were ""persuaded by what they thought was a promise"". Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning Petrol prices have been rising almost daily since the end of April, despite wholesale costs falling, the RAC has claimed.

Volatility,Trump calls for end to quarterly reporting,2024-09-25,2018-08-17,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45226228,"Donald Trump has called for US companies to issue financial reports just twice a year rather than four times. The US President said he has asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to consider altering rules requiring firms to report every quarter. The move would improve ""flexibility and save money"", Mr Trump said. Some analysts have criticised the idea, which they say would ""keep investors in the dark for longer"". Mr Trump tweeted: ""In speaking with some of the world's top business leaders I asked what it is that would make business (jobs) even better in the US. 'Stop quarterly reporting & go to a six month system,' said one"", he tweeted. President Trump said he had ""asked the SEC to study"" such a move. Analysts said the idea of having companies report less frequently was not new, with some suggesting it could make markets less transparent and more volatile when financial data is released after such a long period. ""If you reduce transparency, including the frequency of reporting, it is thus likely to increase uncertainty, which is the enemy of investors,"" said Robert Phipps, a director at Per Sterling Capital Management. Stan Shipley at Evercore ISI said: ""[If] you give investors less information on what's going on, there's a risk of injecting volatility in your stock price because investors are not guided the right way.  ""You're more likely to surprise investors when you're reporting just twice a year instead of quarterly.""  However, other analysts said reducing the frequency of financial reporting to twice a year could potentially reduce ""short-termism"" in listed companies' strategies. ""The difficulty in making better long-term decisions away from a quarterly reporting cycle certainly stands out as being beneficial,"" said Art Hogan at investment bank B. Riley FBR. Randy Frederick at Charles Schwab argued that such a major change for both companies and traders would be ""like trying to turn around the Queen Mary in a swimming pool"". ""This is not something he can change with an executive order,"" he added. The SEC requires listed US companies to issue quarterly and annual financial reports to keep investors informed about their financial position.  The Trump administration wants to cut red tape that it says is responsible for a 50% drop in companies coming to market over the past two decades, including relaxing some of the disclosure and compliance requirements for listed companies and those looking to go public.  In a report published by the US Treasury last year, the administration outlined policies it hoped would revitalise listings - but did not go as far as suggesting quarterly reporting requirements be scrapped. The SEC was not immediately available for comment."
Volatility,Public consultation on post-Brexit farming,2024-09-25,2018-08-01,By Conor Macauley,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-45030489,"Plans for the future of farming in Northern Ireland after Brexit have gone out to public consultation.  They include measures to support farms and improve the environment.  The public has until 10 October to give their views.  The current system of EU subsidy payments will no longer apply after 2019. A decision on the shape of the final policy will not be taken until devolved government returns.  It is envisaged that even under domestic arrangements there will be little change until 2022, when a new NI specific system could be introduced.  It is hoped it can improve farmers' productivity, protect their incomes from external shocks like extreme weather or market volatility and encourage them to work in a way which is more environmentally sustainable.  Many farmers rely heavily on support payments for the bulk of their income.  The Ulster Farmers' Union welcomed the consultation but said it was frustrated it had taken so long ""to get the document onto the table"". ""We have to make sure that Brexit is an opportunity for farmers here,"" said president Ivor Ferguson. ""This is an opportunity to create a better system, and it is essential we take this chance to get it right."" The policy paper says such payments can help farms remain viable but can also mask inefficiency.  In coming years it suggests a farm payment which is lower than that currently received and asks for views on the appropriate level.  It also suggests differentiated payments depending on the condition and quality of the land farmed.  Measures could be considered to stop larger farms being overcompensated and prevent money going to non-commercial holdings.  A range of other measures such as income insurance and a deposit scheme, which farmers could save to in good years and draw cash from in bad years, are also suggested.  The new farm policy would encourage farmers to help address significant environmental challenges linked to the industry including water pollution and ammonia emissions which impact biodiversity and sensitive sites.  It says changes in farming practices could deliver ""major gains"" which should be the focus of new proposals.  The policy proposal states farmers should be financially rewarded for providing ""public goods"" like improved biodiversity and asked to help design schemes to do this on a landscape-wide level.  Targets include increases in important habitats and species at favourable status; improved soil and water quality; reduced ammonia emissions and a continuing fall in the carbon intensity of food production.  The paper does not go into detail about what proportion of farm income might be drawn from such schemes.  The policy document also focuses on plans to drive innovation and encourage farmers to share knowledge and get qualifications and training.  There are also proposals to encourage investment and attract young farmers into the industry.  It includes suggestions on a move away from the system of short-term land leasing called conacre to a more efficient system of long term rental. "
Volatility,Building material costs affect public projects,2024-09-25,2021-08-03,By John Campbell,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-58070738,"Northern Ireland construction companies facing big rises in the cost of building materials could be allowed to increase the prices of previously agreed public sector contracts. Building firms are dealing with surging global prices for products like timber. The Stormont Executive has agreed guidance for government departments dealing with contractors. It includes the possibility of agreeing cost increases or later completion dates.  Finance Minister Conor Murphy said the impact of the pandemic on supply chains has ""had a huge impact on the availability of construction materials with global demand, product shortages and delivery delays leading to market volatility and increased prices"". ""Government contractors are experiencing escalating costs and delays in getting materials which they could not have foreseen when they tendered for government work."" The executive has agreed a ""procurement advisory note"".  It says that where a contractor can ""provide compelling evidence on an open book basis"" that it has experienced a significant delay in the supply of a product that impacts on a completion date then the department and contractor should work together ""in a spirit of mutual trust and cooperation"" to identify alternative materials or agree a change to the completion date. On prices, it says it is reasonable to expect contractors to absorb price fluctuations ""within moderate tolerances"".  However it acknowledges that in the current environment contractors may be able to show they are facing cost increases that are higher than that ""which a diligent contractor could reasonably have anticipated"".  In that situation the department should consider adjusting the price of the job. The note emphasises that firms will have to provide ""full transparency"" on how they originally priced a job and how material costs have changed. Mr Murphy said: ""I am pleased the executive has agreed my proposals to make provision to manage delays in supplies and to include mechanisms in existing and new contracts to make allowances for inflationary prices."" The move has been welcomed by the construction industry which has been warning that some firms were facing difficulties in completing contracts at previously agreed prices. Mark Spence, managing director of the Construction Employers Federation, said: ""We welcome this vital lifeline for local contractors who for many months have been shouldering the escalating burden of unforeseen global price increases and material shortages whilst ensuring public works continue to be delivered."" The measures will be reviewed at the end of September."
Volatility,SSE gas and electricity prices to rise again in NI,2024-09-25,2022-08-26,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-62688553,"The energy company SSE Airtricity is putting up its gas and electricity prices in Northern Ireland again. Gas prices will rise by 28.3% from 1 October and electricity prices will go up by 35.4% from the same date. It comes after Ofgem announced the energy price cap in Great Britain will rise to £3,549 a year from October. However, some consumers in NI will be the equivalent of £1,000 a year better off than customers in the rest of UK, the region's energy regulator has said. The chief executive of the Utility Regulator, John French, has calculated that the equivalent combined gas and electricity customers in Northern Ireland will pay £2,393 a year from October. ""I fully recognise that this differential between Great Britain and Northern Ireland is cold-comfort to those who are struggling here,"" he added. Peter McClenaghan, from the Consumer Council, said Northern Ireland was ""facing into a very serious crisis this winter"" and he is angry and fearful on behalf of consumers. The Consumer Council provides advice to consumers and Mr McClenaghan said that ""already many of our households are at the brink"". ""This announcement means consumers in Belfast face combined annual gas and electricity bills in excess of £2,500 a year, with further price increases to come,"" he said. Other companies will also be putting up their prices as they are buying energy in the same wholesale markets as SSE Airtricity. Those wholesale markets are currently a horror show, suggesting that energy prices will continue rising steeply into the early months of next year. SSE Airtricity is Northern Ireland's largest household gas supplier with about 188,000 customers. Those customers have already seen the price they pay more than double since the spring of last year. The Utility Regulator says the latest increase in the price of gas - the fifth since April 2021 - will be equivalent to another £351 a year. Mr French said the wholesale gas market was ""[continuing] to surge"". ""[It] is producing prices 16 times higher than normal historic rates,"" he said. ""We will continue to do everything in our control to support consumers at this very difficult time."" The announcement by SSE Airtricity comes on the day Stormont Finance Minister Conor Murphy confirmed that the UK government would deliver an energy bill discount of £400 to help households in Northern Ireland that are struggling with the increasing cost of living. But he said there was no guarantee that Northern Ireland households would receive the discount in October, when those in the rest of the UK are due to get it. Donna Dugan, from Carrowdore, County Down, works full-time and cares for her mother Anne, 86, who has vascular dementia and Alzheimer's. She says the price of home heating oil has ""gone up a lot"". ""We got an oil fill up just before the summer period - we normally pay a certain amount every month - and unfortunately this time we were £400 short, which is quite extraordinary for us. ""Over the summer, we have had the heating off completely and we've never had to do that before."" They have also reduced the number of baths Anne has to reduce costs, and she takes more showers instead. Donna says the £400 energy bill discount would make a ""huge difference"". She says it is imperative that ""something is done really urgently"" to tackle the issue. ""I worry that if mummy's situation deteriorates, the impact that will have on my ability to work.  ""I need to work, it's not a choice for me to have reduced hours because we couldn't financially manage. I need to work full-time."" Craig Harrison, of Carers NI, said ""carers are on their knees, financially"".  ""We had the worst rate of carer poverty of anywhere in the UK even before the cost of living crisis began to bite,"" he added. ""Carers' financial situation on all fronts has just deteriorated more and more since then."" He said day-to-day, carers are going hungry, because they cannot afford to buy food. Mr Harrison said they were missing mortgage payments, and borrowing money from friends and family to get by.  ""I'm even aware of female carers having to make their own sanitary products."" SSE Airtricity is also the second largest supplier of household electricity, with about 168,000 customers. They will see their bills rise by the equivalent of another £330 a year. SSE Airtricity managing director Klair Neenan said: ""It was hoped market volatility would ease but the global energy crisis continues to impact gas and electricity costs for all energy suppliers. ""We are acutely aware of the impact this has for households and are working hard to help where we can."" The company said any customer who was concerned or having difficulty with their energy costs should ""please contact us and we will work with you to find a solution together"". Two-thirds of homes in Northern Ireland use oil for their heating. The Consumer Council tracks the price of home-heating oil and its data suggests that prices fell during July, roughly in line with the price of Brent crude oil. But prices have started to increase again in the past two weeks. The Northern Ireland energy market is very different from the rest of the UK for a variety of historical reasons. The electricity market was liberalised much later than the rest of the UK; the former state-owned incumbent still has half the domestic market and there are only a handful of suppliers. The gas network is a relatively recent development and there are still regulated monopoly suppliers in some areas. That means the market is regulated differently from the rest of the UK, for example without the price cap mechanism. Mr French believes that Northern Ireland's simpler market is part of the reason for the lower prices in Northern Ireland. He told BBC News NI: ""We price regulate one company at a time, so we are regulating SEE Airtricity at the moment, that was the announcement today. ""What they are doing in GB in terms of the price cap is looking at the 70 odd companies and try to give an announcement that covers the needs of those 70 companies."" He said that while the GB price cap is forecast to go towards £5,000 in January at the moment he does not see that in the current market for Northern Ireland. It is difficult to give an overall energy cost comparison between Northern Ireland and GB because Northern Ireland is still heavily reliant on heating oil for home heating."
Volatility,House of Fraser slumps to £44m loss,2024-09-25,2018-05-10,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44068513,"Department store group House of Fraser lost almost £44m in 2017 as sales fell.  The department store's potential new Chinese owner, C.Banner, said the loss of £43.9m reversed a pre-tax profit of £1.5m for the previous year, while sales fell 6.3% to £787.8m.  It blamed Brexit, terror attacks and online for damaging the performance of the group, which owns 59 UK stores.      The Chinese group has agreed to take a 51% stake in House of Fraser if the chain pushes through a turnaround plan.  The extent of the chain's financial problems were revealed in a document submitted by C.Banner to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, announcing its proposal to acquire the stake in House of Fraser.  It pointed out that the annual loss figure for the House of Fraser group included the start-up and operating costs of House of Fraser China, but excluded the licence fee payable from the Chinese business to House of Fraser UK for the use of the name in that market. Separate figures for the UK business have yet to be reported.  However, the document said: ""The Brexit referendum and the UK's resultant decision to leave the European Union and the terrorist attack in London, combined with a rapidly evolving retail market, produced a period of uncertainty and volatility that resulted in a difficult trading environment for the whole retail industry in the UK.""   However, C.Banner said House of Fraser would become ""more stable"" after completing its restructuring plan and ""take advantage of its well-known brand to capture growth potential"". Earlier this month, C.Banner said it would take a controlling stake in the retailer from another Chinese firm, Nanjing Cenbest, but only if House of Fraser agreed a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) with its creditors.  The chain expects to make a formal CVA proposal next month, with a full restructuring in place by early 2019. Store closures are planned and the chain wants to renegotiate rents on others.  A CVA is designed to help a struggling company to pay back a proportion of its debts over time. It involves a strict repayment scheme overseen by an insolvency practitioner and must be approved by at least three quarters of the firm's creditors. "
Volatility,SSE Airtricity natural gas prices to rise by 39%,2024-09-25,2022-03-04,By Clodagh Rice,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-60620138,"SSE Airtricity will increase its natural gas prices for households and businesses by 39% from April.  It will add about £244 onto the typical household bill, which the Consumer Council says is the biggest rise in gas prices in their network since May 2011. The move will affect about 186,000 gas customers throughout Northern Ireland. SSE Airtricity said the continued pressure on global energy markets has had a significant impact on energy suppliers' ability to keep prices down. Their tariffs are independently scrutinised and approved by the Utility Regulator in consultation with the Consumer Council and the Department for the Economy. Andrew Greer, SSE Airtricity general manager, said: ""We understand this news will be unwelcome, if not unexpected, to our customers, given the extensive media focus on wholesale markets over the last six months. ""The cost of purchasing natural gas on the wholesale market has reached record highs this winter and regrettably, a proportion of this must be reflected in our prices,"" he added. ""In March 2021 gas cost around 50 pence per therm, today that cost is around £2 per therm after hitting as high as £4.50 per therm late last year."" Raymond Gormley of the Consumer Council said the company had no option but to increase costs.   He also said the invasion of Ukraine will push costs up. ""Energy prices could be volatile for a number of weeks and will remain high for the foreseeable future,"" he added. ""This situation shows the importance of the Department for the Economy's energy strategy that aims to tackle affordability in the long term and move us away from our dependence on fossil fuels."" John French, chief executive of the Utility Regulator, said the conflict in Ukraine has significantly exacerbated the volatility and price movements within the market. ""The cost of wholesale gas has increased significantly over the last seven months largely due to Russia reducing the supply of natural gas into Europe,"" he said. ""However, today's announcement does not take into account the further upward wholesale price pressures we have seen since Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

The 31-year-old editorial director at online US fashion website Highsnobiety is unsurprisingly passionate about clothes. He says his favourite luxury brands are now substantially cheaper in London.  ""Like anything from Comme Des Garcons. I got a jacket last time I was there for 40% less than I would have paid here,"" he says.  Before June last year, when the UK voted to leave the EU, he rarely went shopping on his regular work trips to the UK.  ""The littlest things from a pint at the pub to a short Uber ride were murder on my bank account because of the exchange rate.""  Now that some brands are significantly cheaper, he spends about $350 (£274; 310 euros) each time he comes, but thinks the favourable exchange rate means he saves around $100. ""It's easier for me to splurge and sometimes I do it too much for my own good,"" he confesses. Mr DeLeon isn't the only one indulging.  Just over a year on from the EU referendum, the pound is still around 16% lower against the dollar. The weakness has lured over a flock of international tourists hungry for high-end brands at relatively bargain prices.  Payments firm WorldPay says non-UK consumers' card spending at department stores rose by a fifth in the first three months of the year, while spending on electrical goods rose 22.7%.  US shoppers like Mr DeLeon have been amongst the biggest spenders, splashing out an extra 21.5% on their cards during the same period, it said. ""The extreme currency fluctuations encourages shoppers to buy more,"" says Honor Strachan, principal retail analyst at GlobalData.  ""They're getting more for their money."" But how do companies manage this kind of discrepancy; with precisely the same product priced significantly differently depending on where in the world it is bought? After all a boom in revenues in one market, can seriously dent demand in the markets international shoppers are coming from.  Many of the world's most famous brands — such as Burberry and Apple — simply raised their UK prices to try and make sure what they sold cost broadly the same across their international markets. But luxury footwear brand Crockett & Jones, which has 12 stores worldwide across locations including London, Paris and New York as well as global wholesale partners, says it has deliberately left prices unchanged.  ""The last thing we want to do is abuse our customer confidence and raise prices in the UK. ""We certainly don't increase our prices at a whim to take advantage of said currency fluctuations,"" says James Fox, export sales director at the firm.  Mr Fox believes that in the long term it's best to keep pricing simple. ""We strive to have a level playing field as and where we can.  ""We offer sterling, euro and dollar price lists, which gives our customers piece of mind that they are buying in their own currency at a level price to the potential competitors within their market."" He says generally any discrepancies tend to average out across currencies, and that re-pricing is only possible ""once or twice a year"" due to the upheaval it causes for the business overall. So is he concerned that the firm could be losing out financially? ""We are fortunate to be in a position that we have a few very strong 'Brexit proof' markets which underpin the company when the UK is trying its best to screw up international trade,"" says Mr Fox. By selling both through its own stores and through wholesalers the firm's risk is already spread out, he adds.  Crockett & Jones is not the only retailer which has kept prices steady.  Ray Clacher, executive vice-president at Trinity - owner of premium brands Gieves & Hawkes, Kent & Curwen and Cerruti 1881 - says non-EU tourists using either the US dollar or a currency that trades in line with the dollar, have driven up sales at its London stores. Nonetheless, these sales are still just a small percentage of Trinity's total revenue. ""We certainly have not adjusted our retail prices to reflect the influx of tourism, in fact, quite the opposite as we want to encourage more UK [sales],"" he says. However, he admits this strategy could change if costs continue to rise.  ""If inflation continues to rise and sterling continues to struggle against the euro and dollar, we will have no choice but to pass on the cost to our customers - but not at present,"" says Mr Clacher.

But it is also important not to be too greedy. Many US retailers that have come to the UK have simply swapped their dollar signs on their US price tags for pounds - betting that British consumers will be willing to pay a premium for their goods. Banana Republic is one such example. After eight years in the UK, it announced last year it would close all eight of its stores. The decision followed six consecutive quarters of falling sales.  ""They thought that because they were a big brand, they could demand higher prices. But UK consumers ""are savvier than that,"" says Ms Strachan. Yet for retailers doing a straight currency conversion from their local currency to the country where they are selling their goods also doesn't necessarily work.  ""Asos made a big thing about launching local websites with a straight currency conversion and it didn't work - local pricing didn't fit in line with competitors.  ""Brands need to look at who else is operating in that space, the wealth of consumers there, and what they're willing to pay, and then price accordingly using localised pricing structures,"" says Ms Strachan. Many firms, particularly larger brands such as Hermes also use currency hedging to protect themselves. This involves working with a bank to buy currency at the current rate to protect themselves against adverse future volatility. In the end, though Ms Strachan says a company's ability to cope with currency volatility comes down to how much people want to buy what they sell. ""If they still want it customers will buy it,"" she says."
Volatility,Aston Martin boss hits back at the doubters,2024-09-25,2019-03-06,By Russell Hotten,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-47457220,"The boss of Aston Martin Lagonda has delivered a passionate defence of the company's strategy amid signs some city investors are losing faith. Andy Palmer said the company will prove the sceptics wrong, as he stressed the luxury carmaker's long-term plans and importance to UK manufacturing. Aston Martin's shares slumped last week as the UK's only quoted carmaker posted its first results since going public. It comes as Aston rolled out its latest products at the Geneva Motor Show. These include models to take on the likes of Ferrari, Rolls-Royce and Bentley, meaning that James Bond's favourite carmaker will soon be able to compete in all segments of the luxury car market, from hypercars to sports utility vehicles. But Mr Palmer fears that Aston Martin's ""good news message"" is being drowned out. Last month, the shares sank about 20% after the carmaker delivered its maiden set of profit figures. The share price went below £11, having debuted on the London Stock Market last October at £19. One long-time city observer said Aston Martin's very brief life as a public company was so far the worst he had seen in almost 30 years. But Mr Palmer blamed the share price slide and criticism on people who don't understand the long-term investment case.  And because the actual number of shares listed is relatively small, this increases the price volatility. ""My disappointment with last week's reaction is because the results were, in fact, really, really strong,"" he insisted. Mr Palmer wants people to understand Aston Martin's importance to British manufacturing.  ""Everything else has been sold. When everything is sold overseas, when you come to economic downturns it is much easier to switch off a plant if it's not in your home backyard.  ""It's much easier for Honda to close their plant or for Nissan to turn off the X-Trail... because [the HQs] are a long way from home. ""We need to create engineers in the UK; we need to create intellectual property; we need to create apprentices. When you don't own your own industry, you can't guarantee that you can do that."" The UK car industry ""messed up in the 1970s and '80s"", says Mr Palmer, an executive at Nissan before taking the top job at Aston Martin. ""It's a legacy time bomb that has been sitting with us for some time."" The motor show launch included the first car to be produced under the company's revival of the legendary Lagonda marque. Lagonda is being re-launched as an all-electric brand, with the All-Terrain Concept unveiled at the show set to go into production at Aston Martin's new factory at St Athan, Wales, in 2022. The car will line up against the Rolls-Royce Cullinan and Bentley's Bentayga, although Mr Palmer expects his product to be more appealing to millionaire tech entrepreneurs. The car will have a range of about 400 miles, and wireless rapid-charge technology - and cost about £300,000. The Lagonda brand was born in 1899 and ""we need to invigorate it,"" Mr Palmer said. ""It will be the first all-electric vehicle luxury car brand."" Aston Martin also unveiled its Vanquish Vision, a 200-mph supercar to challenge Ferrari's new F8 Tributo and latest Lamborghinis. The Vision's price tag is at least £250,000. Completing the line-up of launches was a £1m hypercar, called the AM-RB 003. It will be put into production in late 2021. Mr Palmer described the unveilings as ""a show of force… It shows our long term story remains strong and on track,"" he told the BBC.  The Geneva displays are part of the company's Second Century strategy to launch one new model a year for seven years. With the launch of a planned new Lagonda sedan, in production from 2023, that strategy will be complete. After that, ""it's copy-repeat, copy-repeat"", he said. He described Second Century as a defensive plan to protect Aston Martin, loss-making for decades, against downturns in the global economic cycle and changing markets. ""We'll have a company more capable of dealing with these things,"" he said. ""My job is to make sure the company is prepared for these events."" Mr Palmer has been a vocal critic of the UK leaving the EU without a deal, putting his head above the parapet long before many other executives. ""The worry is that you get contaminated with the Brexit story."" But he is hopeful an agreement will be done before 29 March because he ""finds it inconceivable that sensible people in Brussels and UK can't find a deal"". There is, of course, the rest of the world to worry about, although Aston Martin's key China and US markets are doing well. He is particularly pleased with the continuing growth in China, where 50% of customers are now female. So-called rich empowered females are an important growth market, including in Saudi Arabia, where driving restrictions on women have been lifted. The company has opened more dealerships in the country. Mr Palmer accepts that Aston Martin still has a macho, perhaps intimidating reputation - a legacy of the 007 connection. But that's more the case in the West, he believes. ""The preconception does not exist in China, which is why we've been able to get to 50%"". But the company still needs to do more to attract women buyers and get them into the showrooms for a test drive, he says. There will be no ""pinking and shrinking"" of the cars, but much more emphasis on marketing and approach. ""We don't want to alienate any potential customer, male or female."" He has set up a female advisory board, made up of the sort of rich empowered females he wants to buy his cars. They meet about once a quarter to advise on everything from car design to car advertising.  ""When men talk about female customers they can sound condescending, even though that's not the intention. The advisory board helps us to get the tone and manner right."" If only setting the right tone and manner among city investors was as easy."
Volatility,Isle of Man electricity prices set to rise,2024-09-25,2023-03-06,By Ashlea Tracey,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-isle-of-man-64836764,"Electricity bills on the Isle of Man are set to rise by 51% on average, Manx Utilities (MU) has announced. The increase will by applied in two stages, in April and in July, following a six-month price freeze. It means an average customer's annual bill could go up by more than £380. MU chairman, Tim Johnston MHK, said the firm could no longer shield customers from price hikes due to volatility in the wholesale gas market. ""We are very conscious of the impact that this will have on our customers and the decision... is not one the Manx Utilities board has made lightly,"" he added. MU said it had been absorbing price changes by using £25m of reserves and saving £40m by forward purchasing gas, which is used to produce most of the island's electricity. But the state-owned energy provider said it was no longer sustainable to do so with a deficit of about £50m anticipated for the next financial year. The increase will mean that a customer who lives in an two or three bedroom house, and does not use electricity to heat their home, will see their annual bill rise by more than £380. The energy provider explained this type of household could expect an increase from £751 to £942 from April, and then to £1,133 from July.  Politicians backed plans to freeze tariffs for the winter months in September and provide a £26m loan to MU, to be taken from treasury reserves. Mr Johnston said MU had not used the loan as temporarily reducing tariffs would mean higher tariffs in the future, and a higher overall cost for customers. ""The aim has been to minimise the cost to our customers whilst ensuring Manx Utilities can continue to meet its financial obligations,"" he added.

Volatility,The rollercoaster ride of Scotland's first gold mine,2024-09-25,2020-12-02,By Magnus Bennett,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-54886709,"After 35 years of highs and lows, production is finally under way at Scotland's first commercial gold mine. The journey has been fraught with difficulty for prospectors - but it looks like their investment may be about to pay off. Extracting gold from Cononish, near Tyndrum, in the west of Scotland was never going to be an easy proposition. The technical challenges - and costs - of accessing the precious metal from halfway up a mountain were a daunting prospect for those willing to try.  But try they did. Early attempts from the mid-1980s saw prospectors come and go, as they struggled - and failed - to raise sufficient cash for what was always going to be a capital-intensive project. Their efforts to attract backers were also undermined by the volatility of the precious metals market, which often saw gold prices slump.    By 2006, the mine had changed hands several times and was up for sale once more. That seemed to spell the end of Cononish and Scotland's hopes of producing its own gold for the first time. However, in 2007, Australian-listed firm Scotgold Resources entered the scene and revived the mine.  It has been a rollercoaster ride ever since. By 2013, Scotgold had obtained planning permission and put a funding plan in place, only for the gold price to collapse, making the project less palatable for potential investors. Costs were also spiralling, as the mine had fallen by that point within the boundaries of the Loch Lomond and Trossachs National Park, which meant much more stringent planning and environmental conditions. An earlier application had been turned down due to conservation concerns. The problems were compounded by the fact that Scotgold couldn't raise money from traditional banking sources, given its small-scale nature. That seemed to be that - until Edinburgh-born businessman Nat le Roux arrived on the scene and recapitalised the company in 2014. Since then, he has pumped in millions of pounds of his own money to keep the project alive.  Mr le Roux, who is a former independent director of the London Metal Exchange, said there was ""a certain romance"" about the idea of a Scottish gold mine. ""But when the mine was brought to my attention seven years ago, it seemed to me to have interesting investment potential. ""When I came into it, the problem was one of finance.  ""By world standards, this is a very small mine. At full production, we will be producing about 2,000 ounces of gold a month.  ""At the same time, the amounts of money needed to finance the operation have been quite substantial."" Scotgold anticipates that over the expected nine-year life of the mine it will cost about £25m in capital expenditure and a further £81m in operating costs. That's a whopping sum - but the owners still stand to make millions if all goes according to plan. Gold prices have soared from as low as £700 an ounce in 2015 to more than £1,300 today. Scotgold believes it can recover 175,000 ounces in total from Cononish, worth £236m at current prices.  Repeated feasibility studies have also shown gold deposits at Cononish to be high-grade - and its rarity as ""authentic Scottish gold"" has already attracted a premium from buyers. In 2016, the company auctioned off 10 limited edition 1oz fine Scottish gold rounds formed from initial extractions from the mine.  They raised an average of more than £4,550 per ounce - a premium of 378% over the then spot price of about £950. Scotgold chief executive Richard Gray has steered the company through turbulent times in recent years, but describes the team working on the project as ""inherent optimists"".  ""There are always issues and problems to overcome but we have this belief that we will overcome them and the mine will be very profitable,"" he says. ""I have always been confident in the merits of the project. ""However, without the support of Scotgold's shareholders to stay the course, there was always a risk in the worst case scenario that the company would be forced to sell the asset to someone who would develop it and subsequently reap the rewards."" There are still challenges ahead. These include the impact of Covid-19, which forced Scotgold to delay production of first gold earlier this year. The company is looking to increase its workforce from 25 to 70 as production ramps up, but finding the people to handle the highly technical aspects of gold extraction has also proven a problem.  Mr Gray explains: ""Expertise is needed and you obviously can't find all the people already existing in the area. Some people will have to come from further afield and hopefully settle nearer by."" Scotgold expects to produce 10,000oz of gold next year before ramping up production to an average of 23,500oz a year for the rest of the mine's life. Cononish may yet prove to be the start of a golden era for prospectors in Scotland. Scotgold remains optimistic that it will discover extensions to Cononish, which would lengthen the life of the mine. And it has identified potentially significant gold deposits in other areas of Scotland where it holds option agreements with Crown Estates Scotland. Mr le Roux says: ""It is not like Cononish is one fortuitous discovery in the middle of an otherwise barren landscape. ""My view, and that of others, is that we will end up with a number of gold mines in the west of Scotland, either on the same scale as Cononish or perhaps a little bit bigger, assuming the gold price holds up."""
Volatility,Gove predicts Brexit boost for farmers,2024-09-25,2017-06-22,By Gavin Stamp,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-40348845,"Brexit offers an ""historic"" chance to reshape agricultural policy for farmers and consumers, Michael Gove says. The new environment secretary said leaving the EU was a chance to remove ""cumbersome bureaucracy"" and replace ""inefficient subsidies"" with a better form of financial support for farmers. Mr Gove was recalled to the front bench after the general election. He was addressing a meeting in Parliament organised by the National Farmers' Union. The NFU has warned that the ""wrong"" kind of Brexit deal could result in seasonal labour shortages and the government having to pay billions in direct financial assistance to help farmers cope with market and price volatility. Mr Gove said while EU membership had helped improve environmental standards and encouraged rural diversification, it had had a harmful impact in other areas and the UK's exit from the common agricultural policy meant the UK would no longer be ""dictated to"" by Brussels. ""We now have an opportunity to put things right,"" he said. He pledged to listen to and learn from the industry as the Brexit process unfolded and be their ""energetic champion"" in government. While farmers were excellent custodians of the environment, he said, he recognised that the industry had to be financially viable because people were ""running businesses not just providing scenery"". Mr Gove, whose appointment was criticised by some environmental campaigners, also said combating air pollution would be a priority for him in his new role since clean air was a vital resource for the countryside."
Volatility,Regulator reveals water firms with worst finances,2024-09-25,2023-10-26,By Michael Race,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-67225011,"Thames, Southern, SES and South East have been named as the water firms with the worst financial performance in the UK.  Regulator Ofwat said the companies had been told fix holes in their finances and were being closely monitored. It comes after doubts were raised about the future of Thames Water, the UK's largest supplier, earlier this year due to its £14bn debt pile. At the time, Ofwat was accused of being ""complacent"" in overseeing the sector.  The regulator, which rejected those claims, has vowed to keep a close eye on water company finances and said on Thursday that Thames was among a group of suppliers singled out as having ""significant issues to address"". The four firms were all taking action to ""strengthen long term financial resilience"", it said.  Responding to Ofwat's findings, Thames Water said its network had come ""under unprecedented pressure"" over the past year from record temperatures, a drought and a cold snap. Inflation had also affected its performance. ""In short, our performance was not as we - or our customers - wanted it to be. Despite this, we are in a robust financial position and maintain a strong liquidity position, including £3.6bn of cash and committed funding,"" a spokesperson said. SES said its business was ""financially resilient"" and that its shareholders had committed to investing £7m into the company over the next five years. Southern Water said its new leadership team was ""continuing to deliver"" on a turnaround plan, adding that funds from its majority shareholder boosted the company with an additional £550m of equity earlier this month. Ofwat said it would keep a closer watch on four other suppliers with potential problems: Affinity Water, Northumbrian Water, Portsmouth Water and Yorkshire Water. Fears over financial management in the sector have come as many water companies face heavy criticism due to sewage discharges and leaks.  Last month, Ofwat ordered water companies to pay back £114m to customers through lower bills after missing key targets. The regulator said firms paid out a total of £1.4bn in dividends to shareholders in the most recent financial year, but that there were ""some companies that did not fully meet our expectation in explaining dividend decisions and payments"". ""Dividends are an important part of the investor return however they must take account of performance delivered to customers and the environment,"" Ofwat said. Thames Water, which has 15 million customers across London and the South East, faced calls to be nationalised after it ran into trouble, but managed to secure a £750m cash injection from its shareholders to keep going. The company leaks more water than any other supplier in the UK, losing the equivalent of up to 250 Olympic-size swimming pools every day from its pipes.  The company's future came under the spotlight this summer when it emerged it was in talks to secure extra funding, and the firm's chief executive Sarah Bentley stepped down after just two years in the job. Ofwat said on Thursday that the water sector had secured £4.6bn in extra cash from shareholders since 2020 to help boost firms' financial resilience. But David Black, its chief executive, said companies were expected to ""maintain a level of financial headroom so they can manage periods of volatility and meet their obligations to customers and the environment"". ""Where we have seen cause for concern, we have also seen some companies responding to the challenge and we expect them to continue to work on improving their financial resilience,"" he added. Industry body Water UK said resilience was ""an important foundation"" for companies to deliver a planned £96bn of investment ""to ensure the future security of our water supply and to reduce overflow spills into rivers and seas as fast as possible"". ""While dividends are now much lower than they have been previously, they must be set at the right level for attracting billions in new outside funding to cover the upfront cost of improvements,"" a spokesperson added. South East Water declined to comment."

It could mean on-island diesel generators in the Vale working harder during the next few months. Guernsey currently imports more than 90% of its electricity. The boss of Guernsey Electricity said its deal with French power firm EDF meant customers were protected from huge cost increases seen elsewhere. Alan Bates, chief executive officer at Guernsey Electricity, said: ""The current concerns over security of supply for this winter and the resulting volatility in prices is, to an extent, caused by the electricity generation capacity issues in Europe.  ""We continue to work with Electricité de France (EDF) to manage our island demand and this includes options to assist in managing these issues."" He added: ""This winter we may need to generate more electricity to support Europe in ensuring demand is balanced to the supply available."" Mr Bates said the contract with EDF ""continues to insulate local consumers, through our price fixing strategy, from the huge increases in costs seen in the UK and elsewhere"".  He said: ""The current level of volatility will eventually start to affect prices; however, we have no plans to change tariffs this winter due to the commodity market.""

Volatility,Bitcoin buster? The search for a more stable cryptocurrency,2024-09-25,2018-08-20,By Matthew Wall,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45245149,"Cryptocurrencies - digital tokens known as cryptos for short - have investors in the grip of a gold rush fever, with billions being traded every day. Prices fluctuate wildly, making them high-risk investments. But could a more stable, less volatile crypto persuade us to think of digital money less as a speculative investment and more as a mainstream ""smart"" currency? There are now more than 1,500 cryptos - Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, Litecoin to name just a few - being traded on about 190 exchanges around the world.  Prices have soared and crashed alarmingly. In 2017 the price of a bitcoin rocketed to nearly £15,000 before losing two-thirds of its value in just a few months. It's currently worth about £5,000. This volatility may be a speculative trader's friend, but it has reinforced cryptos' reputation for being high-risk investments for the adrenalin-fuelled ""get rich quick"" brigade.  Crypto fundraising schemes, known as Initial Coin Offerings, have alarmed regulators around the world. So a growing number of crypto start-ups are developing alternatives known as stablecoins, digital tokens pegged to traditional fiat currencies such as the US dollar, British pound or Japanese yen, with the aim of reducing this volatility and increasing confidence. Hong Kong-based Tether has blazed a trail in this market, swapping about $2.7bn (£2.1bn) worth of fiat currency into its eponymous digital tokens. It claims to have all its digital tethers backed by traditional money in its bank accounts - a claim that has been disputed by some. But Tether's 90% dominance of the stablecoin market is enticing several others to try something similar.  For example, crypto finance company Circle is launching a new token called USD Coin. ""Imagine a US dollar coin that you can make payments with, use on crypto networks, or use in smart contracts to pay dividends, but which you can convert back to fiat currency at any time,"" explains Circle chief executive Jeremy Allaire. Circle's USD Coin will run on the Ethereum blockchain - the distributed ledger technology underlying cryptos - and have an open standard infrastructure overseen by a body called Centre. It wants Centre to become the main platform for other stablecoin operators.  ""Crypto represents the next layer of infrastructure for the internet,"" he says. ""It will allow money to move at the speed of light around the world for free, but also offer binding, verifiable contracts, enabling anyone to do business together. ""We're going to see a lot of businesses using tokens for revenue raising. And eventually central banks will want to do this,"" maintains Mr Allaire. Circle, which is backed by the likes of Goldman Sachs and Baidu and has an estimated value of close to $3bn, recently attracted another $110m in investment led by investors such as Chinese crypto mining giant Bitmain.  Kory Hoang is the founder of Stably, a firm in Vancouver that is developing StableUSD, another US dollar-backed stablecoin. The Vietnam-born entrepreneur believes the sector presents ""a huge opportunity"", especially for people in countries with unstable currencies. ""Fruit sellers on the streets in Zimbabwe could accept your digital payment via an app,"" he says. ""Their fiat money is almost worthless, but they could receive tokens in seconds and sell them very easily for a small commission."" Obi Nwosu, founder and chief executive of Coinfloor, a crypto exchange collective, says: ""There are about two billion people who are unbanked or underbanked, which means they have no access to the world of e-commerce.  ""Bitcoin and cryptos give these people access at much lower cost, but admittedly with less protection."" But there is disagreement within the industry about the best way to reduce the price volatility of cryptos. Coinfloor hopes to solve the volatility issue by attracting far more money into the sector in the belief that greater trading volumes will lead to a more efficient market.   This will require better regulation, argues Mr Nwosu, before large institutions are likely to commit serious money. Concerns about the abuse of cryptos for money laundering and terrorist financing remain a barrier to mass acceptance, he says. But this is still better than going down the stablecoin route, he believes, which requires a central organisation to back the digital tokens, with the extra cost this entails. And this structure conflicts with the decentralised nature of cryptos and blockchain technology and could be ""the worst of both worlds"", he says. ""We think that although stablecoins could be popular in the short run, a decentralised currency that is stable and doesn't have a central organisation behind it will be safer in the long run."" Whatever the disagreements about how to achieve price stability for currency and investment purposes, most people in the sector agree that a crypto's additional ability to act as a smart contract presents huge opportunities to ""tokenise"" physical assets. ""Say I have a house in downtown Saigon worth $1m,"" says Mr Hoang. ""I could tokenise it and sell those tokens on the global crypto market. You could issue a billion pieces of your house if you wanted. Then people would start trading them, just like shares in a real estate investment trust. ""It gives investors around the world access to investment opportunities they never had before."" Akbar Thobani, chief executive of crypto trading platform SFOX, says: ""We think that tokenising assets, such as trucks, cars, planes and real estate, will become big business.""  But if stablecoin cryptos do become as mainstream as fiat currencies, will the system be able to cope with the volume?  Many fear blockchain is getting slower and in danger of seizing up altogether. Ethereum, one of the most popular blockchain platforms, is only able to process about 13 transactions a second, whereas card payment processing platform Visa can cope with more than 20,000 transactions a second.   This is why work is afoot to create more flexible blockchain-based platforms, such as EOS and Stellar, that could cope with a vast increase in transaction volume and millions more users."

The SRC-KPMG retail sales monitor recorded a 2.3% year-on-year drop in total sales. Food sales were up by 0.8% but non-food sales were 4.8% lower than the same period last year. Retailers said it was evident that consumers were ""restricting"" their discretionary spending. The Scottish Retail Consortium (SRC) said in the non-food category, fashion sales continued to be ""quite poor"", with retailers reporting even discounted products ""underperforming expectations"". SRC head of policy Ewan MacDonald Russell said there had been ""a clear trend"" in recent months of a slowdown in consumer spending.  He said: ""The SRC remains concerned the intense political and economic volatility, along with the prospect of further costs resulting from government policy, is discouraging consumption.  ""The consequence of the unending Brexit gridlock and stagnation is reduced confidence amongst retailers and consumers - which can only reduce overall growth."" KPMG head of retail Paul Martin said: ""The latest figures provide further evidence that growing economic and political uncertainty is taking its toll on Scotland's high streets.  ""While non-food sales fell victim to the largest dip, food retailers are far from immune from the difficult trading conditions, with another flat performance."""
Volatility,UK economic growth hits six-month low,2024-09-25,2019-01-11,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46835078,"Growth in the UK's economy slowed in the three months to November, expanding at its weakest pace in six months.  The economy grew by 0.3% during the period, less than the 0.4% in the three months to October, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. The ONS said manufacturers suffered their longest period of monthly falls in output since the financial crisis, being hit by weaker overseas demand. It also said the economy grew by 0.2% in November, up from 0.1% in October. Rob Kent-Smith, head of national accounts at the ONS, said: ""Growth in the UK economy continued to slow in the three months to November after performing more strongly through the middle of the year.  ""Accountancy and house building again grew but a number of other areas were sluggish. ""Manufacturing saw a steep decline, with car production and the often-erratic pharmaceutical industry both performing poorly."" Month on month, construction growth was 0.6% in November. manufacturing contracted 0.3%, while services activity rose 0.3%. Production as a whole contracted 0.4%. Worries about the global economy, stoked by an ongoing trade spat between the US and China, have had knock-on effects for other economies, as well as the UK. Figures from Germany and France earlier this week similarly showed falling industrial output.           The ONS said the UK economy was returning to moderate growth rates after some volatility earlier in the year, in part related to the weather. The concern that Brexit uncertainty may be weighing on sentiment and spending has become all too familiar. But these GDP numbers suggest there's more to the cooling down of growth toward the end of last year - and worryingly so.  They suggest demand from our trading partners is faltering. Industry suffered its most widespread fall in output since 2012, with a drop in car production leading the charge. Separate data showed that, once erratic items like aircraft orders were stripped out, the gulf between imports and exports - the trade deficit - widened  to £9.5bn in the three months to November.  And we're not alone in feeling the pinch. Germany, France and Spain have released manufacturing figures this week that were unexpectedly grim.  From Apple to Jaguar Land Rover, some of the biggest global brands have been blaming faltering overseas demand, particularly from China. for their woes. They may have a point. Growth across our major trading partners is tailing off.  It's a timely reminder that, whatever arrangements are in place come the end of March, we may not be able to rely on our economic allies overseas to keep our factories and workshops thriving. Commenting on the economic figures Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, said:  ""This marks the manufacturing sector's longest losing run since the 2008-09 recession.   ""There are two factors at work here. The global economy looks to be stuttering, with the 'Chimerica' trade war rumbling on, and Chinese consumer spending on a downward trend.  ""UK companies are also dealing with a significant Brexit headwind, with heightened levels of uncertainty putting business off investment and damaging consumer confidence."""
Volatility,The man who wants to make the world normal,2024-09-25,2018-02-02,By Andrew Walker,https://www.bbc.com/news/42904545,"What is arguably the top economic policy job on the planet is changing hands.  Jerome Powell is taking over from Janet Yellen in charge of the United States' Federal Reserve, the country's central bank.  He takes charge a decade after the financial crisis, which has seen central bankers around the world take very usual measures to keep their economies stable.  So what challenges will he face and how can we expect him to handle them?  The answer will have an impact on the rest of the world. The Fed's job description has been set out for it by Congress - it is to achieve ""maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates"".  Given that there are three elements, you might find it surprising that it's generally referred to as the Fed's ""dual mandate"".  The focus is usually on the two aspects of the mandate that have a direct impact on the American public, inflation and jobs.   On both of them (and also on the long term interest rates) the US economy is currently looking in reasonably good shape.  The Fed has target for inflation of 2% for a measure known as the personal consumption expenditure price index.  The latest figure was 1.7% and slightly lower if you take out the volatile contribution of food and energy prices. Inflation is thus on the low side from the Fed's perspective, but not by a wide margin.  Unemployment is very low. At 4.1% it's the lowest since the end of 2000. There are places where it's much higher. It's also true that the very low rate partly reflects a decline in the percentage of the adult population that is either working or actively seeking to work (known as the labour force participation rate).  That in turn partly due to the ageing US population but it also reflects people of working age who have dropped out of the labour market, some as result of the problems associated with addiction to opioid painkillers.  Important though these issues are, the monetary policy tools at the Fed's disposal are not much help in addressing them.  The Fed can only really affect conditions across the entire national economy. For the Fed, the issue is whether further declines in unemployment could force employers to offer sharply higher wages to get the workers they need which could in turn feed through into much faster price rises.  The Fed's policy makers seem to think unemployment could go a little lower over the next year or two without generating substantially higher inflation. But over the longer term they think the jobless rate is likely to move slightly higher to about four and a half per cent.  The key policy is the Fed's interest rate policy. Its main tool is the target for the federal funds rate which is what banks charge one another for overnight lending. The Fed doesn't directly fix the rate, but it can steer it towards the target by buying and selling securities. It currently looks like the Fed will probably raise its main interest rate target three times this year. In previous months there have been different views about rate rises - whether too much might hold back economic growth and job creation or whether too little might risk a surge in inflation. Those debates could well resume as the Fed takes further decisions this year. The Fed is far more advanced than central banks in Europe and Japan with the return of policy to something like normal in the aftermath of the financial crisis. It has already raised interest rates five times from the post crisis lows.  In the eurozone the European Central Bank has not even started that process.  The Bank of England has reversed the rate cut that it made after the EU referendum, but that's all. The UK is back to the post-crisis level of official interest rates.  Then there's quantitative easing, buying financial assets (particularly government debt) with newly created money. The ECB is still actively doing it. So is the Bank of Japan, though both have reduced the amount of new securities they are buying.  The Fed finished in October 2014 and is now starting to reduce its stock of assets. This gradual return of Fed policy to something like normal raises a question about the stability of financial markets. The strong performance of share prices (in many other markets too) owes a great deal to central banks' easy money policy.  Is it a bubble?  Throughout this period there have been concerns expressed that it might be and that the return to normal might lead to instability in the markets. Whatever the Fed does it will have an impact on the rest of world. The first step in the return to normal (in 2013) was known as tapering, a gradual reduction in the amount of assets purchased each month under the QE programme.  It produced some volatility especially for emerging markets, an episode known as the ""taper tantrum"". The subsequent increases in interest rates have been less eventful.  The markets have seen them coming as the Fed has made its intentions clear - though always subject to what the economic data actually show.  Still, those questions remain about whether the enthusiasm in stock markets has got ahead of itself.  One of Mr Powell's predecessors, William McChesney Martin, famously said his job was ""to take away the punchbowl just as the party gets going"". The risk could be - and there are different views on this - that the party might already be out of hand, and that a nasty hangover is on the way. "
Volatility,Cream drummer Ginger Baker dies aged 80,2024-09-25,2019-10-06,By Mark Savage,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-49827436,"Ginger Baker, one of the most innovative and influential drummers in rock music, has died at the age of 80. A co-founder of Cream, he also played with Blind Faith, Hawkwind and Fela Kuti in a long and varied career. His style combined the lyricism of jazz with the crude power of rock. One critic said watching him was like witnessing ""a human combine harvester"". But he was also a temperamental and argumentative figure, whose behaviour frequently led to on-stage punch-ups. Nicknamed Ginger for his flaming red hair, the musician was born Peter Edward Baker in Lewisham, south London, shortly before World War Two. His bricklayer father was killed in action in 1943, and he was brought up in near poverty by his mother, step-father and aunt.  A troubled student, he joined a local gang in his teens and became involved in petty theft. When he tried to quit, gang-members attacked him with a razor. His early ambition was to ride in the Tour de France but he was forced to quit the sport when, aged 16, his bicycle got ""caught up"" with a taxi. Instead, he took up drumming.  ""I was always banging on the desks at school,"" he recalled. ""So all the kids kept saying, 'Go on, go and play the drums', and I just sat down and I could play. ""It's a gift from God. You've either got it or you haven't. And I've got it: time. Natural time."" The strong legs he'd developed on long bike rides helped him play the double bass drum set-up he favoured and Baker soon talked his way into his first gig. He played with jazz acts like Terry Lightfoot and Acker Bilk but his style - fragmented and aggressive, but articulate and insistent - was often an odd fit. Instead, he gravitated towards London's burgeoning blues scene and, in 1962, joined Alexis Korner's Blues Incorporated on the recommendation of Charlie Watts  - who was leaving to join the Rolling Stones.  He gained early fame as a member of the Graham Bond Organisation alongside bassist Jack Bruce - but it was their partnership with Eric Clapton in Cream that made all three superstars. One of rock's first ""supergroups"", they fused blues and psychedelia to dazzling effect on songs like Strange Brew, Sunshine of Your Love, Badge and I Feel Free. They sold more than 35 million albums and were awarded the world's first ever platinum disc for their LP Wheels of Fire. Along with the Jimi Hendrix Experience, the band expanded the vocabulary of heavy rock, especially during their incendiary live shows, where the three musicians would stretch simple riffs into long, exploratory improvisations.  ""It was as if something else had taken over,"" Baker once said of playing with Cream. ""You're not conscious of playing. You're listening to this fantastic sound that you're a part of. And your part is just… happening. It was a gift, and we three had it in abundance."" But the volatility that fuelled their performances was rooted in animosity. Baker and Bruce's arguments were frequent and violent, even driving Clapton to tears on one occasion. Once, Baker attempted to end one of Bruce's solos by bouncing a stick off his snare drum, and into Bruce's head.  ""So I grabbed my double bass,"" Bruce later recalled, ""and demolished him and his kit.""  The band eventually split after two years and four albums, with a farewell concert at London's Royal Albert Hall in 1968. ""Cream came and went almost in the blink of an eye, but left an indelible mark on rock music,"" wrote Colin Larkin in the Encyclopaedia of Popular Music.  Bands who built on their template included Deep Purple, Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin - not that Baker was impressed.  ""I don't think Led Zeppelin filled the void that Cream left, but they made a lot of money,"" he told Forbes. Following the band's demise, he teamed up with Clapton and Steve Winwood to form Blind Faith, followed by the ambitious 10-piece Air Force, which combined his interests in jazz and Afro-fusion. While the musicianship was of a high standard, the eclectic mix of jazz, blues, African music and a surfeit of drums - there were three percussionists - was never going to inspire a mass following. After one studio album and a live concert at the Royal Albert Hall, Air Force, undermined by personnel changes, finally crashed and burned.  The drug-related death of his friend, Jimi Hendrix, persuaded Baker it was time to leave the London music scene and get clean. He left Britain to live in Nigeria, where he recorded with Fela Kuti and built his own recording studio. He helped Paul McCartney record the classic Wings' album Band On The Run, although their relationship soured over claims that he was never paid. Financial problems of one sort or another dogged him throughout this period and he eventually lost control of his studio. Away from music, he took up rally driving and, somewhat incongruously, developed a love of polo, building up a sizeable collection of ponies, despite his tendency to get injured. ""I've had a lot of falls which have wrecked my body,"" he told the Telegraph in 2013. ""They had to take a piece of my hip bone out and screw it into my neck."" In the 1980s, he played with John Lydon's Public Image Ltd, while continuing to form and discard new bands that combined his African and Western musical influences, like African Force and Middle Passage. While commercial success eluded him, his reputation, particularly with a new generation of drummers, remained high. ""His playing was revolutionary,"" said Neil Peart, drummer with the Canadian band Rush. ""He set the bar for what rock drumming could be."" Cream were inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993, briefly reuniting to play three songs, then teamed up again in 2005 for a series of concerts in London and New York.  Almost inevitably, the performances ended with Baker and Bruce fighting on stage. ""It's a knife-edge thing for me and Ginger,"" Bruce said afterward. ""Nowadays, we're happily co-existing in different continents... although I was thinking of asking him to move. He's still a bit too close."" Baker had, in fact, headed to South Africa, where he spent the reunion money buying polo ponies and funding a veterinary hospital.  In 2012, he became the subject of a hugely enjoyable documentary - Beware of Mr Baker - which illustrated how his jaw-dropping drumming was neither as wild nor as extraordinary as his personal life.  In the opening scene, the musician was seen attacking director Jay Bulger with a metal cane, declaring: ""I'm going to put you in hospital."" He later settled down to reflect, cantankerously, on the trail of broken bands, ex-wives and neglected children he'd left in his wake. Contributors marvelled at his talent, but little else. ""He influenced me as a drummer, but not as a person,"" recalled Free's Simon Kirke, who toured with Cream. In later years, he was beset by ill health, breaking most of his ribs and subsequently being diagnosed with a degenerative spine condition and the onset of emphysema. ""God is punishing me for my past wickedness by keeping me alive and in as much pain as He can,"" he told Rolling Stone at the time. The musician fought osteoarthritis to record his final album, Why?, in 2014. Two years later, he underwent open heart surgery and announced his retirement from touring. ""Just seen doctor… big shock… no more gigs for this old drummer... everything is off,"" he wrote on his official blog. ""Of all things I never thought it would be my heart."" Baker's death will see him feted as one of rock's most influential musicians, but he scoffed at such accolades, insisting: ""Drummers are really nothing more than time-keepers."" He told Rhythm magazine: ""It's the drummer's job to make the other guys sound good."" Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

Volatility,US orders 'unprecedented' release of oil reserves,2024-09-25,2022-03-31,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60936468,"US President Joe Biden has ordered a major release of oil from America's reserves in an effort to bring down high fuel costs. The release of up to 180m barrels of oil over six months is the largest since the reserve was created in 1974. Oil prices dropped on reports of the move, which is aimed at easing a supply crunch sparked by war in Ukraine. But the release - of about 1m barrels a day - is unlikely to fully resolve the energy crisis, analysts say. Mr Biden promised further action to boost US output, saying the release would ""serve as [a] bridge until the end of the year when domestic production ramps up"". He called for companies to pay extra if they choose not to use oil wells on land they lease from the government, as well as investments to speed up the adoption of greener energy sources. Following Mr Biden's remarks, US oil benchmark West Texas Intermediate was more than 7% lower at about $100 a barrel, while Brent Crude fell roughly 5.4% to around $107. The soaring cost of fuel has become a major political issue around the world, including in the US, which hosts mid-term elections in November. Mr Biden said the scale of the release from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve - which together amounts to less than two days of global consumption - was ""unprecedented"".  Thursday's announcement marked the third time in six months Mr Biden has moved to draw down America's crude oil stockpiles But the release of additional reserves is unlikely to be enough to compensate for lost supplies from Russia - the world's second-biggest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia. ""While stock releases will help to keep a lid on prices in the short term, we think it will take an increase in global production to spark a sustained fall in prices,"" said Edward Gardner, commodities economist at Capital Economics. Brent crude - the global benchmark for oil prices - hit $139 a barrel earlier this month after Russia's invasion of Ukraine and sanctions slapped on Moscow by the US and its allies. Energy prices have fallen back since then, but oil is still almost 70% higher than it was a year ago. Analysis by Samira Hussain, BBC News reporter It makes for an excellent headline: President Biden releases unprecedented amounts of oil from strategic reserves. But it really only offers a temporary fix to global shortages. So why is the White House even bothering?  Domestically, the President is under a tremendous amount of pressure. November is the midterm elections and Democrats hold a very slim majority that they are desperate to hold on to. Rising inflation was already an issue, and Republicans have been laying the blame for the high cost of living on the White House and specifically Mr Biden.  The record high cost of fuel just adds to the pain being felt by the American middle class. And it certainly doesn't jive well with the president's ""Joe from Scranton"" vibe. Global demand for energy had been rising prior to Russia's invasion of Ukraine as economies started to reopen as coronavirus lockdown measures were relaxed. However, the war in Ukraine has raised fears of supply issues, with warnings that Russian oil exports could fall by as much as 3m barrels a day. Most major energy-producing nations are either at full capacity or are unwilling to increase output. On Thursday, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) and its allies, including Russia, confirmed they were sticking to their existing deal to gradually increase production.  The decision came despite pressure from the US, UK and others on members of the group of oil producing nations to boost output. ""The consensus on the outlook pointed to a well-balanced market,"" the group said. ""Current volatility is not caused by fundamentals, but by ongoing geopolitical developments."" The International Energy Agency (IEA) has called an emergency meeting but it is unclear whether other countries, including the UK, France, Germany and Japan, will follow the US by releasing oil reserves.  Mr Biden said he was coordinating with Western nations on the release of the stockpiles and expected them to release another 30 to 50 million barrels. Also on Thursday, Japan said that it would take emergency measures to secure supplies of seven strategic materials it relies on heavily from Russia or Ukraine as the war and sanctions cause disruptions to supplies. The country's industry minister said the actions include government support to boost domestic production, alternative procurement and to help technological developments to reduce use of the materials, which include liquefied natural gas and gases used in computer chip-making."
Volatility,'The potential Guardiola replacement taking football to next level',2024-09-25,2023-10-18,BBC Sport,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/67136969,"Pep Guardiola has led a new way of playing in the past 15 years which has influenced football culture, countries and other coaches.  But not many have taken his teachings, understood them deeply and had the bravery to push that style to the next level, like Brighton & Hove Albion's Italian manager Roberto de Zerbi has done. If there are a group of fans anywhere in the world that can even begin to understand the passion and commitment shown by De Zerbi to the game, it is those of Brighton - a club who have gone from teetering on the brink of extinction to the Premier League and Europe. That same spirit and commitment continues in the latest leg of Brighton's epic journey under the passionate gaze of the 44-year-old Brescia-born coach, regarded by many as one of the finest to make it into the Premier League since Guardiola arrived in Manchester. A manager who is admired by many and, as his side travel to champions Manchester City on Saturday just two points behind them, is already being eyed as a potential Guardiola replacement once his Etihad Stadium era ends. Latest Brighton news, analysis and fan views Get Seagulls news notifications Listen to the latest Albion Unlimited podcast Roberto de Zerbi has taken Brighton into this season's Europa League In football, as in life, things do not always happen by design. Sometimes they are the result of a combination of circumstances, coincidence and adversity. The first time I met De Zerbi was in Split, Croatia, where his then club Shakhtar Donetsk were playing a friendly against Hajduk Split to raise funds for Ukraine following the country's invasion by Russia.  After the game, as we chatted, I noticed a number of players coming out of the dressing room in tears. The war in Ukraine meant he was left with no choice other than to leave the club who, at the time of the suspension of the league, were top of the table. De Zerbi had chosen that moment to tell them he was leaving - and the sadness was palpable. Then Graham Potter received an offer he could not refuse from Chelsea, and Shakhtar's loss would become Brighton's gain when De Zerbi signed a four-year deal at Amex Stadium on 18 September, 2022. It would be too simple, however, to suggest De Zerbi's arrival was all about circumstances and nothing to do with forward planning. Brighton knew about the Italian manager since his days at Sassuolo, who had top-eight finishes in two consecutive seasons, and were admirers of his brand of attack-minded football. The English club imagined a time where an approach would be inevitable. With their fingers so firmly placed on football's pulse, De Zerbi's appointment was clever and innovative. Their admirable scouting would do the rest by signing great young prospects and making huge profits by selling them, to be replaced by new prospects. All energetic players, mouldable, young, and technically more than capable. Perfect for what De Zerbi expects and demands of them. I do not know of any manager in the world who is gaining more respect from top coaches worldwide than De Zerbi.  I get more messages about him and his style from managers than I do about any other coach. They admire the risky demands on his players, how he improves them, their offensive mentality, and especially how - for some of them - he makes their life much harder.  It helps that he is at a club where he does not face expectations about titles or Champions League qualification. That lack of pressure undoubtedly helped when he started his reign without a win in his first five games. At that point nobody at Brighton doubted they were in really good hands. The talk of aiming for qualification to the most glamourous club football competition has started in the corridors of Brighton's training ground, though. De Zerbi's ambition is contagious.  Last season the Seagulls, nowhere near being among the six biggest clubs in England, finished the season in sixth place and were a penalty shootout away from the FA Cup final. The club now intends to ensure they not only maintain their level but build on it, and that is because of pressure generated by De Zerbi on himself and everyone involved with the club. Expectations are high on the agenda he has created. The club knows Tottenham wanted to take him in the summer and that he decided to stay. They want him to continue to take Brighton on to bigger and better things. The battle to improve is a constant one, and deep down De Zerbi probably senses he can never really take the team, the style, the development as far as he would like - constant attack and wins to get to the Champions League - though that is not going to stop him trying. In that respect he is very similar to his friend, Guardiola. Both want to push on, both aware perfection is just a target, albeit the most important one. They share a similar philosophy on how the game should be played and Guardiola has even admitted he has learned things about the game from De Zerbi. The Brighton boss even spent some time with Guardiola between leaving Shakhtar and joining the Seagulls. Those that witnessed the interactions between the two men will tell you half the time they did not understand what the pair were talking about, while for the other half they had been talking for so long everyone else had already left the building. There is no doubt Manchester City have taken note, and, if Guardiola leaves the club in the summer of 2025, De Zerbi would be on the shortlist to replace him. Could Roberto de Zerbi replace Pep Guardiola at Manchester City in 2025? Fundamentally, Guardiola developed a way of playing the game which offensively had four phases; building from the back, circulating the ball in midfield, putting things in process for the preparation of the last pass and making the final decision. He has evolved the game in the first three phases, but it would take someone with the same energy of when he started in 2008 to get to the last one - the organised final decision. That element of the game that most strikers and forwards would claim is intuitive and instinctive, coaches like Guardiola and De Zerbi believe it can be trained, learned and improved upon. But try telling that to the players.  De Zerbi is trying. He wants to take football to another level from where Guardiola has taken it, doing things that have not been done. Under him, players risk more than ever and are more dynamic than ever. He puts more players in front of the ball than most and works harder than most at organising the attack. Players enjoy working with him now they understand what is expected of them.  It was not that clear in their minds in the first few weeks at Brighton. Results did not arrive quickly, and there were some voices that questioned what he was trying to do, but the club never doubted him. De Zerbi has always enjoyed a great relationship with his players wherever he has been, primarily because he is honest, straight and clear with them. The key word is respect, and he respects and treats everyone as he would expect to be treated, while still being very much his own man.  He started as a coach ten years ago and has remained loyal to his philosophy throughout, while learning  from other coaches to develop his ideas.  De Zerbi has made everyone at Brighton eager to work, adapt, improve and learn, and he has adapted to the different demands placed on him in different countries. In England, players appreciate more the chance to enjoy a day off from the rigours of training in order to be able to work better and fresher. He has noted that players return keener, sharper and more ready after a day off.  The mentality in Italy, where he coached Sassuolo and where they train every day, is different. He has learned the need to allow his players to recharge their batteries. His volatility on the touchline has also become more tempered, not least because he has seen that it is as expensive as it is counter-productive. He is learning the English way. Jason Steele is a player reborn at Brighton. After spending much time as a second-choice, sometimes even third-choice goalkeeper at previous clubs, under De Zerbi he has played his way into England contention. Steele recently told the club's programme: ""I look forward to coming into training every day. There hasn't been a minute when I've thought 'I could do with a rest today'. ""He's full on, always working, always trying to get better, trying to learn, and it rubs off and it's infectious. ""The way I see football now whether I'm playing or watching TV is totally different to how I used to see it two, three or four years ago. I see a totally different sport now just through what he has taught us."" When Spain forward Ansu Fati was deciding what club to join on leaving Barcelona, he narrowed it down to Tottenham Hotspur or Brighton. He spoke first with Ange Postecoglou, who certainly impressed the young player, and then with De Zerbi who told him that as a former number 10 himself he understood the pain and the battle he had been enduring back in Spain. He told him he knew about the frustrations of being ignored and how his style and that of Brighton would help Ansu rekindle his love for the game and maximise the potential everyone knew he had. That, and the style Brighton play, was more than enough to convince Ansu the English club was the next logical step for him.  He wanted to be coached by Roberto de Zerbi.

Volatility,US firms 'more negative' about doing business in China,2024-09-25,2023-03-23,By Jonathan Josephs,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-65034881,"US companies are ""more negative than they've been in a long time"" about doing business in China, according to the president of the American Chamber of Commerce in China (AmCham China). As tensions continue to grow between the world's two biggest economies, Michael Hart says that the rivalry has ""made business very challenging"".   The governments of President Xi and President Biden have been disagreeing on what seems like an ever-increasing number of issues; ranging from Ukraine, to coronavirus, and Taiwan, to Tiktok, and semiconductors.  That is reflected in AmCham China's latest annual survey of its more than 900 members. For the first time it shows that a majority, 55%, no longer regard China as a top-three investment priority - a place where they should spend money to grow their business.  The number who see the ""uncertainty of bilateral relations"" as their leading challenge in China has risen 10% in the last year to 66%. At the same time, the number who think China has become less welcoming to foreign companies has grown to 49%.  It's now five years since then US President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on $60bn (£49bn) of Chinese goods, as he stepped up his trade war over ""unfair trade practices"" including intellectual property theft and the trade deficit.  China followed through on its promise to retaliate with tariffs of its own. AmCham China members include some of the US's most successful companies such as Nike, Intel, Pfizer and Coca-Cola.  The latter was the first US consumer business to sell its products in communist China after then President Deng Xiaoping opened the country up to foreign companies in December 1978. Ever since then trade has been at the heart of the relationship.  Corporate pessimism over the current state of the US-China relationship reflects a tumultuous few years, according to Mr Hart.  ""Companies are just really tired after three years of Covid,"" he adds, also highlighting a number of other issues. These include travel becoming more difficult, rising labour costs, executives who are ""just not willing"" to take up assignments in China, political pressure, and China becoming a less predictable place in which to do business.  Despite all those difficulties, the numbers show trade between the two countries hit a record high of $690.6bn last year.  This reflection of their mutual dependence has implications for the health of the entire global economy. That is according to Eswar Prasad, who is a professor of global trade policy at Cornell University, and former head of the International Monetary Fund's China Division. ""The reality is that China does need a lot of products, especially technology products from the US, and the US does have a lot of companies that run their supply chains through China,"" he says. ""This is important for the global economy because it's not just supply chains that these two countries are critical for. The tenor for global trade is set by the relationship between these two countries."" The World Trade Organisation (WTO) is supposed to keep that tenor harmonious by upholding global trade rules.  However, in December, the Biden administration forcefully rejected two rulings that went in China's favour about the tariffs that were imposed by then US President Donald Trump as part of his trade war. The US said they were imposed over issues of national security that the WTO had no right to rule on.  Overall, 66.4% of US imports from China and 58.3% of Chinese imports from the US remain subject to tariffs, according to the Peterson Institute for International Economics, with little sign that either side will reduce them.  More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade. ""The way the US is approaching its relationship with China could lead to a deterioration of the rules-based global trading system that the US and China have signed on to,"" says Prof Prasad. He adds: ""If the US starts withdrawing from engagement with multilateral institutions that does not bode well for global governance."" The souring US-China relationship also means a growing number of US companies are looking at moving their supply chains outside of China. Apple has become one of the world's most profitable companies by making huge numbers of iPhones in China, but is now increasingly making them in countries such as India.  However, that will only have a limited impact on getting round US-China tensions according to Dan Wang, who is the Shanghai-based chief economist at Hang Seng Bank China. ""Even if the US succeeds in building up an alternative supply chain, that alternative one will still largely depend on China,"" she says. Those other countries will still rely on China for components, especially in industries such as green energy, medical technology and electronics, explains Ms Wang. Whilst companies aren't shunning China all together, Mr Hart does say that ""they're trying to de-risk their supply chain"". He adds: ""So they're having more of a China plus one strategy, and they realise that can no longer rely on China."" China's economic growth has slowed to an annualised pace of 3% as coronavirus restrictions curtailed business activity. At the recent National People's Congress, the newly appointed Premier Li Qiang said that, now those measures had been lifted, the target was 5% growth, although it would ""not be easy"" to meet. Ms Wang says: ""Beijing still wants US companies to invest in China, and that attitude I do not believe will change anytime soon."" Mr Hart adds that the giant Chinese consumer market is probably the place where US firms remain ""the most optimistic"". Firms such as McDonald's, Starbucks and Ralph Lauren all have major Chinese expansion plans in the pipeline. However, all this comes against a backdrop of national security concerns between the two nations, centred on technology. These have led to a growing number of measures by the Biden administration to try to stop China accessing US technology. These include trying to limit new investments in China by US semiconductor manufacturers. Both countries have been trying to increase government support for technologies they regard as critical to the future of the global economy. In his State of the Union speech last month President Biden said: ""I've made clear with President Xi that we seek competition, not conflict."" ""I will make no apologies that we are investing to make America stronger. Investing in American innovation, in industries that will define the future, that China intends to be dominating."" However that approach has not gone down well in Beijing, where President Xi said recently that ""Western countries - led by the US - have implemented all-round containment, encirclement and suppression against us, bringing unprecedentedly severe challenges to our country's development"". It is a rivalry which is increasingly affecting individual companies and spreading around the world.  Chinese telecoms giant Huawei has been restricted in many countries because of US pressure, with Germany the latest to consider taking action. Meanwhile, social media firm Tiktok has been threatened with a complete ban in the US, whilst also facing restrictions in the UK. All these tensions between the US and China mean ""the temperature is certainly very high"", according to Prof Prasad and that could come at a cost that is felt well beyond the US and China. ""Rising hostilities between the world's two largest economies, which together account for roughly 40% of world GDP, are likely to create more volatility and uncertainty, which is the last thing an already fragile world economy now needs,"" he says."
Volatility,Oil suffers biggest drop in two years,2024-09-25,2018-07-11,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44802143,"Oil prices suffered steep falls on Wednesday after Libya said it would boost supply, even as investors fear that trade tensions will hit demand. Brent crude dropped 6.9% - the biggest decline in more than two years - to end at $73.40 a barrel for the global benchmark. US crude fell 5% to $70.38 a barrel - its worst one-day decline in a year. The declines followed a months-long rally that had increased prices to some of the highest levels in recent years. However, oil prices have been volatile in recent weeks after the US said it would reinstate sanctions against Iran, a major producer. Wednesday's sell-off started after the announcement by Libya's National Oil Corp that it would reopen four export terminals that had been closed since late June, shutting most of the country's oil output. The falls came despite a US government report that American crude oil stockpiles fell by more than 12 million barrels last week and are about 4% lower than average for this time of year. OPEC president Suhail Al-Mazrouei said volatility in oil prices was not desirable: ""Fluctuation is not good and we do not like to see lots of fluctuation in the prices."" Economists are worried that escalating trade tensions between the US and China will hurt the global economy, lowering demand. On Tuesday, the US unveiled a list of $200bn worth of products to be hit with 10% tariffs, prompting China to vow counter-measures. The back-and-forth followed tariffs on $34bn of each country's goods that went into effect last week  While fallout from those measures is expected to be relatively limited, that could change if the fight continues. China was the world's biggest oil importer last year, followed by the US."
Volatility,Pound slips in early trading after Brexit non-vote,2024-09-25,2019-10-20,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50117804,"The pound slipped against the dollar as currency markets got their first chance to react to MPs backing a move to delay approval of the Brexit deal. Many banks in London had called in extra staff, expecting volatile trading after the first Saturday sitting in the House of Commons for 37 years.  But the pound's reaction was muted, slipping 0.6% against the dollar to $1.29, and down 0.4% against the euro. On Friday, the pound had been trading at its highest level for five months. Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at Oanda, said the fall in the currency was limited because ""despite more twists and turns than any other soap opera in history, a hard Brexit is now highly unlikely"".   Jane Foley, senior foreign exchange strategist at Rabobank, told the BBC's Today programme: ""[Investors] are a little bit more anxious certainly than they were at the end of last week. There was a lot of confidence going in to Saturday's vote that there would be something a little bit more constructive. ""Instead, of course, we've got this delay, so the lower pound this morning reflects the delay. But sterling hasn't sold off very much. If we go back 10 to 12 days, we were trading at $1.22, so we are significantly higher and this is of course related to optimism that Boris Johnson's government may have the numbers to push this deal through. This could still be done in a very short period of time. ""But of course, if we look at the medium term, there is still plenty of scope for volatility, there is still plenty of risk."" Deutsche Bank, like many other banks, had set up additional staff to come in on Sunday expecting a strong reaction to Saturday's vote.  But it scaled back numbers after the weekend's events - which saw Prime Minister Boris Johnson send an unsigned request to the EU for a further delay, accompanied by another letter - signed this time - clarifying that was not his own personal position.  Events serious enough to require extra staffing out of normal trading hours are relatively rare in currency trading, normally linked to a big infrequent event such as an election with an uncertain outcome, for example.  But Russell Lascala, global head of FX at Deutsche Bank, said that, since the Brexit referendum, there had been five or six such events. ""The uncertainty has been going on for years. The market is begging for clarity, to be able to invest or not invest."" Sir Ian Cheshire, chairman of Barclays' UK operations, told the BBC that the deal on offer was ""acceptable"". ""No deal is perfect, but this deal is actually doable and it is, I think, very frustrating to see what appears to be a protracted process when most business leaders would like to see some certainty and get on,"" he said. ""The chances of yet another round of negotiations are extremely unlikely to yield anything significantly different and now the delay is beginning to affect consumer confidence, particularly investment confidence, and I think we have to push ahead and make the best of what we've got coming down the track."" Currency analysts say they expect the next strong movement in the pound to be when the Brexit deal is voted on in Parliament.  However, after Saturday's vote, many believe a no-deal Brexit is now less likely. US investment bank Goldman Sachs, which issues regular updates to its clients, now thinks there is a 5% chance of a no-deal Brexit, down from 10% previously."
Volatility,Ryan Giggs headbutted ex-girlfriend - court hears,2024-09-25,2022-08-08,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-62423393,"Ex-Manchester Utd and Wales star Ryan Giggs ""deliberately headbutted"" his ex-girlfriend, a court has heard. Peter Wright QC, prosecuting, told the court Mr Giggs' private life involved a ""litany of abuse, both physical and psychological"". Mr Giggs, 48, denies a charge of coercive behaviour and assaulting his ex-girlfriend and her sister. His defence counsel said the case against him was based on ""distortion, exaggeration and lies"". Mr Giggs is charged with controlling and coercive behaviour against his ex-girlfriend Kate Greville, 38, between August 2017 and November 2020. He is also charged with assaulting Ms Greville, causing her actual bodily harm, and common assault of her younger sister, Emma Greville, at his home in Worsley, Greater Manchester, on 1 November 2020. Opening his case against Mr Giggs at Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court, Mr Wright said this was a story of ""control and coercion"" of a woman who thought she was ""loved and respected"". He said his relationship with Ms Greville, 36, was ""punctuated by acts of violence and volatility"". He added Mr Giggs was ""idolised"" for his skills on the pitch but behind closed doors had ""a much uglier and more sinister side to his character"". He told the jury they will hear the relationship had ""ups and downs"" and that Mr Giggs was seeing someone else when he was with Ms Greville.  ""Eventually, after years of turbulence, when the scales fell from her eyes, she realised she needed to remove herself from his sphere of influence,"" he said. Mr Wright said this decision to break away led to the incident on 1 November 2020. Mr Giggs is said to have ""lost control"" that evening and headbutted Ms Greville. While both out with friends at Manchester's Stock Exchange Hotel, Ms Greville decided to terminate their relationship, said Mr Wright. He added Ms Greville knew Mr Giggs had ""once again"" been cheating on her, and informed her sister of her plan to end the relationship before leaving the hotel.  ""She intended to make her departure before [Mr Giggs] got back from the hotel. The plan did not work. ""As she was vacating the defendant's home address, he came back and began arguing with her and trying to stop her leaving."" In the altercation that followed, in which Ms Greville took Mr Giggs phone as a ""bargaining chip"", they grappled together on the floor before Ms Greville's sister stepped in, the court heard. Mr Wright said Emma Greville then tried to pull Mr Giggs off her sister, but he ""deliberately elbowed her in the jaw"", before the argument moved to the kitchen.  ""At that stage, we say, the defendant entirely lost self-control and he deliberately headbutted Kate, thereby causing swelling to her lips and bruising. Emma then called the police, who attended the premises."" Mr Giggs' defence team challenged the prosecution's version of events. Addressing the jury, Chris Daw QC for the defence said on a ""moral level"" his behaviour was ""far from perfect"". He told the jury some of his messages and emails were ""marked by immaturity and inappropriate language"", but this was the case for both him and Ms Greville. ""They behaved like squabbling children, playing on the insecurities of the other."" But, Mr Daw said ""no matter how rude, unpleasant and mean"" they were, there were ""lines Mr Giggs would never cross"". ""He never once used unlawful violence against Ms Greville,"" he said, adding that the case against him was based on ""distortion, exaggeration and lies.""  He said it was ""clear"" Ms Greville's injuries were not consistent with a head butt from ""a strong and physically fit man"".  Referring to the incident on 1 November 2020, Mr Daw said Mr Giggs and Ms Greville both tripped and fell to the floor in the kitchen of his home and that she kicked him in the face as he tried to disentangle himself.  Mr Daw added Mr Giggs was not aware the complainant's sister was in the house at the time and did not elbow her, as alleged. The alleged headbutt was ""not only a nasty lie but a ridiculous one,"" he said, as evidence in the trial will show there was ""minor and accidental contact"" between their faces. Mr Daw said in the weeks before, Ms Greville told friends she was determined not to walk away from the relationship with nothing. He added Mr Giggs had encouraged Ms Greville's career ambitions in PR, backed her with his own company, and introduced clients.  She was always financially independent, free to travel and see her friends as much as she wanted, he told the court. ""Both could be childish,"" he said. On nights out, they would often block each other's numbers.  ""Immaturity is not a crime,"" he added, and when it comes to law and morality, ""law is what matters"".  Mr Wright, QC for the prosecution, also told the jury the abuse from Mr Giggs was ""interspersed with acts of kindness and contrition"". He said Mr Giggs would say she had misunderstood him, had jumped to the wrong conclusion and that he was the victim. ""We say this was controlling and coercive behaviour,"" he added. ""This was a behaviour to gaslight her, and make her pliant and compliant."" He said the behaviour was ""calculated"", and was ""conduct that would have an obvious and serious effect on her emotionally and physically"". Standing in the dock, wearing a dark grey suit, Mr Giggs listened to the opening statements and watched as the jury of seven women and five men was selected and sworn in for the trial. The jury was told witnesses in the case will include former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson and former player Gary Neville. The trial - expected to last around 10 days - will relocate to Manchester Crown Court from Tuesday and remain there for the duration. Mr Giggs has denied all charges - the trial continues. "
Volatility,Energy bill help to be reduced from April,2024-09-25,2022-10-17,By Daniel Thomas,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63283436,"A scheme to cap all household energy bills for two years will be cut from April, the new chancellor has said.  Jeremy Hunt said the support - which limits a typical household bill to £2,500 - would be reviewed so it cost ""significantly less than planned"".  He said the most vulnerable would continue to be protected from soaring wholesale energy prices. The move sparked concern among consumer groups who warned households would be plunged into uncertainty.  ""Everyone knows why decisions have been made at breakneck speed, but there are questions that need to be answered, and answered quickly,"" said National Energy Action boss Adam Scorer. ""Who will still get support? Will it include vulnerable households not on welfare benefits? Will that support be deeper for those in greatest need?"" Mr Hunt is trying to save money after the government's mini-budget left a big projected hole in the public finances. Its plan for large tax cuts sparked turmoil on financial markets over how the plans would be funded. ""Beyond [April], the Prime Minister and I have agreed it would not be responsible to continue exposing public finances to unlimited volatility in international gas prices,"" the chancellor said.  ""The objective is to design a new approach that will cost the taxpayer significantly less than planned whilst ensuring enough support for those in need,"" he said. Under the Energy Price Guarantee, announced last month, Ms Truss's government capped all household energy bills for two years from 1 October in a bid to prevent millions facing hardship this winter. Now that will only be in place for six months, just to cover this winter. The Treasury will review support given from April, but Mr Hunt said there would be ""a new approach"" targeting those in the most need. Before this guarantee was introduced, the energy price cap - the highest amount suppliers are allowed to charge households for every unit of energy they use - had been due to rise to £3,549 for a typical household from October. Predictions from consultants Cornwall Insight suggest that, for households that do not receive any support, a typical annual energy bill could be £4,347 in the spring, dropping to £3,722 next winter - however that prediction could be significantly affected by changing wholesale prices. How is the rising cost of living affecting you? Get in touch. Consumer rights campaigner Martin Lewis said that while the support for intervention had been desperately needed, a ""universal energy price guarantee was always expensive and poorly targeted"".  But he added: ""The post-April support will still need to reach a decent way up the net and support middle earners, energy rates are still huge."" Ms Truss's plan - thought to cost up to £150bn - was to be funded through government borrowing after the prime minister rejected calls to extend a windfall tax on oil and gas firms.  However, former chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng followed it with plans to cut taxes by some £45bn. Concerns about rising borrowing sparked turmoil on financial markets which spilled over into the mortgage market, where interest rates on loans have surged to 14-year highs.  On Monday, Mr Hunt promised to review the energy support while also reversing £32bn worth of the planned tax cuts. The new chancellor said he was doing ""what is necessary for economic stability"". He added that the Energy Price Guarantee had been ""the biggest single expense"" of Mr Kwarteng's growth plan.  When it was announced, many had criticised the scheme for not being targeted enough, arguing the support should have been means tested.  The Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank, which had described the package as ""clearly not sustainable in the long-term"", welcomed Mr Hunt's decision. ""While large-scale untargeted support for households this winter was perhaps unavoidable we need to do everything possible to put in place a better designed, better targeted and less expensive scheme next year,"" said IFS director Paul Johnson. But the Centre for Ageing Better, a charity, said many older people faced an anxious wait to find out how much help they would get.  Boss Carole Easton said: ""The previous two-year promise provided a level of security for people in uncertain times.   ""It is vital that the government gives plenty of advance notice with clear messaging as to who will be eligible for targeted support in April."" Under Ms Truss's scheme, businesses are protected for six months from soaring energy prices, with those struggling most set to continue receiving help pending a review.  Mr Hunt suggested the targeted approach would continue, but the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) called for clarity.  ""The review to come on business and consumer energy support after six months must avoid a cliff-edge for small firms that remain impacted and vulnerable,"" said the FSB's national chair, Martin McTague.

Volatility,Deutsche to take €1.5bn US tax hit,2024-09-25,2018-01-05,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42584658,"Deutsche Bank will take a €1.5bn (£1.3bn) charge following changes to the US tax code, meaning it will not make a profit for 2017. The bank said its trading revenue in the fourth quarter also declined about 22% year-on-year, amid lower market volatility and less client activity. Shares in Deutsche fell nearly 6% after the announcement. The German lender also posted annual losses in 2016 and 2015. Deutsche has grappled in previous years with hefty legal costs connected to money laundering charges, among other violations, but had hoped to turn a profit in 2017.  On Friday it said the tax changes would lead to a ""small full-year after-tax loss"". Several large companies have announced one-time hits due to the changes to the US tax code that cut the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. In the long run, corporations expect to benefit from lower rates. But the switch has led many companies to revalue deferred tax assets, which are tied to deductions for past losses and can be used to reduce future tax payments.  As well as Deutsche, Morgan Stanley said it expected the changes in its deferred tax assets to lead to a $1.25bn hit."
Volatility,"May stays, for now",2024-09-25,2017-06-08,By Laura Kuenssberg,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2017-40209585,"What a day. This time last night, the two main parties were pouring cold water all over the exit poll that put Theresa May's future in doubt. Tonight that question is very much on Tory minds. She said today that she wants to stay and is in the process of working out how to deal more closely with the DUP (not without controversy) to get her business through Parliament. Yet, there is an increasing mood that she might not get the chance to do so for very long. One minister predicted that, ""slowly and reluctantly"", the party might rally round her.  But sentiment in the party, never scientific, seems to be drifting away from allowing that situation to happen.  Three MPs have publicly questioned her right to stay on. One senior Conservative told me tonight she ""has to go"", suggesting she has a ""responsibility to the party"" to get the Queens Speech through, show the Conservatives can form the government, and then she ought to move aside.  Other MPs are gently exploring the possibility of submitting letters to the chairman of the 1922 committee - 48 would be required to trigger a leadership contest.  Another former minister told me: ""I just can't see how she stays."" To stay, there are already demands that Theresa May changes her ways of working. Her loyal chiefs of staff could be forced to go and a deputy prime minister might be appointed to create a less brittle and vulnerable government.  But moves from her might not be enough. Her gamble may not ultimately have just cost the Tories their majority, but for her, her political career.  This situation is changing fast and could feel totally different by the morning. But the rallying round the prime minister that has given her the chance to form a government may turn out to be only a brief window of opportunity - a space to allow her the time to come to her own conclusions.  She stays, for today. After a few hours of wild uncertainty, Theresa May will head to Buckingham Palace to seek permission from the Queen to form a government. She has the understanding and assurance from the DUP to be able to form a government, it seems.  The PM has experienced a political disaster of her own making. But uniquely perhaps for a prime minister in this situation she is, despite her ruthless party's DNA, planning to stay. The reason? Brexiteers don't want to rock the boat. No-one wants another election. And there is paranoia, whatever the EU says publicly, that Brussels would use the opportunity to cause the maximum amount of trouble. The way it's hoped at top levels of the party to avoid that is to leave 'the boss' as they call her, in place. But only for now. I am yet to talk to a Tory source today who believes she can stay for as long as she likes. She is being seen as a caretaker PM, here for continuity at a time of great volatility - strangely the sort of reasons cited when she was nominated for the leadership. That was of course, before Theresa May revealed herself to be a gambler too. A trait only revealed once she moved into Number 10 - a trait that might be her political undoing, even if she keeps the address for now. In the last few minutes the PM has made it plain she will try to stay on and form a government. That's her right to do so, and as the party with the largest number of seats and votes the Tories will almost definitely form the next government.  But there is already pressure on her to go.  The question is not just whether enough Tory MPs are happy to keep backing her but also if it is vaguely realistic for her to stay on with her authority so challenged. The conversations have started not just about whether the Tories will be able to form a government, but whether or not Theresa May can stay in her job.  There is no one prevailing mood inside the Tory party. As I write, Mrs May is holed up with her advisers inside Tory HQ. But a former minister Anna Soubry has called for her to ""consider her position"" - political code for calling for her to resign.  Another senior MP tells me 'I can't see how she can stay'. A minister texts to say the Tory party is 'absolute monarchy, ruled by regicide and that's the territory we are in'. One Tory source says it is '50:50' that she will quit in the morning.  But others are urging caution, calling for reflection, a period of calm. It's clear the Tory party won't allow her to stay on to fight another General Election campaign in some years hence.  But cooler heads may press on her to stay, not to walk away. This is the election none of the main parties predicted.  Just as David Cameron finished off his own career by gambling with the EU referendum he didn't have to have, Theresa May has followed him by calling a national vote when it was not required, because of our relationship with the European Union, and ended her career in the same way.  It's only just after two am. There are lots of seats to come in. But at this stage, Tory ministers are saying they do not expect to outperform the exit poll. That means, despite all of those Tory expectations, that confidence they regained in the last week or so of the campaign, the disbelief there was when our exit poll was announced, that privately at the highest level the Conservatives are now beginning to give up on achieving a majority.  It's just not clear yet whether or not they will be the largest party. Our exit poll suggests that they will. But either way, Theresa May is damaged, ""strong and stable"" sounds less like an irritating political catchphrase, and more like a parallel universe. She called this election only because she thought she would achieve a much bigger majority than the Tories already had.  Even if the Conservatives still end up ahead in terms of the number of seats, her authority looks set to be seriously damaged. It is hard to see how her reputation will recover, and she will have achieved the opposite effect of what she had hoped. This election could produce a more uncertain political picture, a wounded Prime Minister trying to take on the most complicated task any Prime Minister has faced -  that's if, of course, the Tories remain the largest party, and she hangs on.  If these numbers are correct, Theresa May played a high-risk political game and has lost it  - she didn't have to call this election, and only did so in order to give herself a mandate and breathing space during the bumpy ride of Brexit. Just a few weeks ago at the start of all of this she seemed unassailable, but a shaky campaign and an insurgent Labour Party may have dashed the Tories' hopes. This exit poll result is not what either parties were predicting privately - this would be another political surprise - the public again defying the expectations of both the main sides. The Conservatives do look set to be the largest party - it's not clear on these numbers if they will be able to govern alone. Theresa May's promise throughout was to offer her catchphrase ""strong and stable leadership"" - instead she may end diminished - but only of course, your votes, and the real results, will determine through the course of the night what really happens next."
Volatility,US orders 'unprecedented' release of oil reserves,2024-09-25,2022-03-31,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60936468,"US President Joe Biden has ordered a major release of oil from America's reserves in an effort to bring down high fuel costs. The release of up to 180m barrels of oil over six months is the largest since the reserve was created in 1974. Oil prices dropped on reports of the move, which is aimed at easing a supply crunch sparked by war in Ukraine. But the release - of about 1m barrels a day - is unlikely to fully resolve the energy crisis, analysts say. Mr Biden promised further action to boost US output, saying the release would ""serve as [a] bridge until the end of the year when domestic production ramps up"". He called for companies to pay extra if they choose not to use oil wells on land they lease from the government, as well as investments to speed up the adoption of greener energy sources. Following Mr Biden's remarks, US oil benchmark West Texas Intermediate was more than 7% lower at about $100 a barrel, while Brent Crude fell roughly 5.4% to around $107. The soaring cost of fuel has become a major political issue around the world, including in the US, which hosts mid-term elections in November. Mr Biden said the scale of the release from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve - which together amounts to less than two days of global consumption - was ""unprecedented"".  Thursday's announcement marked the third time in six months Mr Biden has moved to draw down America's crude oil stockpiles But the release of additional reserves is unlikely to be enough to compensate for lost supplies from Russia - the world's second-biggest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia. ""While stock releases will help to keep a lid on prices in the short term, we think it will take an increase in global production to spark a sustained fall in prices,"" said Edward Gardner, commodities economist at Capital Economics. Brent crude - the global benchmark for oil prices - hit $139 a barrel earlier this month after Russia's invasion of Ukraine and sanctions slapped on Moscow by the US and its allies. Energy prices have fallen back since then, but oil is still almost 70% higher than it was a year ago. Analysis by Samira Hussain, BBC News reporter It makes for an excellent headline: President Biden releases unprecedented amounts of oil from strategic reserves. But it really only offers a temporary fix to global shortages. So why is the White House even bothering?  Domestically, the President is under a tremendous amount of pressure. November is the midterm elections and Democrats hold a very slim majority that they are desperate to hold on to. Rising inflation was already an issue, and Republicans have been laying the blame for the high cost of living on the White House and specifically Mr Biden.  The record high cost of fuel just adds to the pain being felt by the American middle class. And it certainly doesn't jive well with the president's ""Joe from Scranton"" vibe. Global demand for energy had been rising prior to Russia's invasion of Ukraine as economies started to reopen as coronavirus lockdown measures were relaxed. However, the war in Ukraine has raised fears of supply issues, with warnings that Russian oil exports could fall by as much as 3m barrels a day. Most major energy-producing nations are either at full capacity or are unwilling to increase output. On Thursday, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) and its allies, including Russia, confirmed they were sticking to their existing deal to gradually increase production.  The decision came despite pressure from the US, UK and others on members of the group of oil producing nations to boost output. ""The consensus on the outlook pointed to a well-balanced market,"" the group said. ""Current volatility is not caused by fundamentals, but by ongoing geopolitical developments."" The International Energy Agency (IEA) has called an emergency meeting but it is unclear whether other countries, including the UK, France, Germany and Japan, will follow the US by releasing oil reserves.  Mr Biden said he was coordinating with Western nations on the release of the stockpiles and expected them to release another 30 to 50 million barrels. Also on Thursday, Japan said that it would take emergency measures to secure supplies of seven strategic materials it relies on heavily from Russia or Ukraine as the war and sanctions cause disruptions to supplies. The country's industry minister said the actions include government support to boost domestic production, alternative procurement and to help technological developments to reduce use of the materials, which include liquefied natural gas and gases used in computer chip-making."
Volatility,Turkish lira rallies after rate hike,2024-09-25,2018-05-23,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44233378,"The Turkish lira has pared its heavy losses against the dollar following an emergency interest rate hike by the central bank.  The currency climbed 2.6% higher having fallen 5% earlier to hit a record low.  The lira has lost more than a fifth of its value this year as fears grow that the government might undermine the powers of Turkey's central bank.  Many investors have been calling for higher interest rates to bring down inflation, which is in double figures. Following an emergency meeting, the Turkish central bank steeply raised a benchmark lending rate from 13.5% to 16.5%. ""Current elevated levels of inflation and inflation expectations continue to pose risks on the pricing behaviour,"" the central bank said.  ""Accordingly, the committee decided to implement a strong monetary tightening to support price stability."" The crisis began after the Turkish president said he planned to take more control of the country's finances after a general election on 24 June. Recep Tayyip Erdogan has previously described himself as an ""enemy of interest rates"".  He has also implied that foreign powers are to blame for the lira's collapse. Turkey's President Erdogan calls snap election in June Following the bank's move, Erdogan said ""financial discipline will continue and the necessary things will be done for financial stability"". But he also said the currency's volatility did not reflect economic reality and warned that he would not let ""global governance types"" ruin the country. The lira fell as low as 4.8450 against the dollar early on Wednesday before recovering. However, it is still down by around 17% since the end of 2017.  Peter Dixon, an economist at Commerzbank, said investors were concerned about the amount of financial power that could end up in Mr Erdogan's hands. ""I think markets are beginning to take fright at the extent of government interference over certainly central bank policy,"" he said.  ""That's certainly been one of the factors which has caused the lira to lose ground. It's been a trend which has been ongoing for some time, but I think the rhetoric is being cranked up now."""
Volatility,Tax U-turn lifts pound as borrowing costs fall,2024-09-25,2022-10-03,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63118918,"The pound has climbed after the chancellor reversed his controversial decision to scrap the top rate of tax. Sterling gained more than 1% to $1.1284 before falling back slightly while government borrowing costs edged lower.  Tory MPs had threatened to vote against Kwasi Kwarteng's plan, saying it was unfair when living costs were so high. The U-turn may ease market nerves, said the Institute for Fiscal Studies, but unease remains over how a remaining £43bn of tax cuts will be funded. ""The difference this makes really is trivial,"" said Paul Johnson, director of the IFS think tank. The chancellor pledged to abolish the 45p rate of tax, which is paid by people who earn more than £150,000 a year. Getting rid of the rate would have cost the Treasury around £2bn out of the £45bn worth of tax cuts Mr Kwarteng announced in his so-called ""mini-budget"".  ""This was, if anything, possibly the smallest measure from a fiscal point of view, if not a political point of view, in the mini-budget,"" said Mr Johnson. ""It is about 5% of the tax cuts."" The cut to top-rate tax for high earners sparked anger among opposition and Tory MPs and spooked markets amid concerns the unfunded cuts were unaffordable. The chancellor also declined to publish an independent assessment of his plans by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). Last week, the pound hit a record low and the Bank of England was forced to step in to stem soaring government borrowing costs. Tony Danker, head of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), welcomed the U-turn saying that calming markets was an ""absolute pre-condition to investment and growth"".  He added it had been a ""distraction"" from other important pro-growth reforms promised in the mini-budget. The chancellor is expected to announce reforms to planning laws, green energy, childcare and more in the coming weeks.  But Mr Danker added: ""I think we are going to move onto another test, which is does the chancellor really mean it when he says we are going to reform the supply side of the economy... because I think that is really needed.""  The IFS's Mr Johnson said the U-turn had eased market nerves as there was ""perhaps a sense"" the government would  ""back down"" and ""listen to opinion"".  But he warned of more volatility if the chancellor did not use his next fiscal statement on 23 November to explain how he will fund his tax cuts,  ""He needs to come up with something fairly convincing ... whether that involves undoing some more of those tax cuts or some additional tax rises or something fairly dramatic on the spending side.""  The National Institute of Economic and Social Research called for an OBR forecast to be brought forward.  ""Whilst we welcome this morning's statement, the fundamental issue of how the government expects to finance both its proposed tax cuts and its spending commitments to cap the unit price of energy remains unresolved,"" said deputy director Stephen Millard. ""The overall package continues to be highly inflationary and will lead to faster and higher rises in interest rates than would have been otherwise the case."" The Bank of England has been raising interest rates to try and curb inflation, which is currently at a nearly 40-year-high of 9.9%. On 22 September, the Bank raised rates by 0.5 percentage points to 2.25% - the highest level for 14 years. It warned interest rates could rise again after the value of the pound plummeted, following the government's decision to cut taxes and borrow more. Some were estimating that rates could reach more than 6% next year. However, fears of big rate rises receded slightly after Monday's U-turn on the 45% tax rate, with investors now forecasting a rise to 5.75% by May."
Volatility,Five-day bank holiday in Sri Lanka for debt restructure,2024-09-25,2023-06-29,By Annabelle Liang,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-66049915,"Sri Lanka began a five-day bank holiday from Thursday to allow the crisis-hit nation to restructure $42bn (£33.2bn) in domestic debt. The country is facing its worst economic crisis since it won independence from the British in 1948. There are fears that the government's restructuring plan could lead to volatility in financial markets. Debt restructuring can involve the extension of the period over which a loan is repaid. The plans include a 30% ""haircut"" - or reduction - on some government bonds held by international lenders, central bank governor Nandalal Weerasinghe announced on Thursday. A day earlier, he had said banks were excluded from the domestic debt restructuring exercise. ""The government expects the entire process to conclude while the markets are closed during these five days,"" Mr Weerasinghe said. ""Local depositors are assured of the safety of their deposits and interests will not be affected."" Local media quoted analysts as saying that the holiday was announced to provide a suitable buffer for any potential market reactions to significant financial announcements. ""The government's action to call an extended public holiday means it obviously saw the risk of bank runs,"" Alex Holmes, a senior economist at Oxford Economics, told the BBC. Earlier this week, Sri Lanka President Ranil Wickremesinghe reassured the public that the restructuring would ""not lead to a collapse of the banking system"". On Wednesday, his office said the cabinet had approved a restructuring proposal by the country's central bank, which would be submitted to parliament for approval over the weekend.   Roshan Perera, an economist and a former director at the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, said domestic creditors did not appear to be getting equal treatment. ""From what we see, the banks, private lenders and investors are not being affected from the domestic debt restructuring,"" he told the BBC. ""The central bank balance sheet and the pension funds are taking a broader hit. This is not equitable.""  The employee pension fund is the largest pension fund in Sri Lanka.   The move to restructure domestic debt comes as the country is struggling to come out of its worst economic crisis. Last year, Sri Lanka defaulted on its debt with international lenders for the first time in its post-independence history. However, there have been several important lifelines extended to the country in recent months. The World Bank has just granted it $700m, following a $3bn bailout package from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).  The World Bank said in a statement on Thursday that it would provide support in a ""phased approach"". The organisation added that it has allocated $500m (£396m) to budgetary support, while the remaining $200m would be used to ""provide better-targeted income and livelihood opportunities to the poor and vulnerable"". The IMF's bailout in March, which was nearly a year in the making, was viewed as a massive lifeline for Sri Lanka. However, the bailout came with conditions, such as requiring the country to make ""swift progress"" on restructuring its debts. In March, the IMF said Sri Lanka had secured financing assurances from all its major creditors, including China and India, which paved the way for the bailout. The IMF has so far released about $330m in funds to Sri Lanka, with the rest due in disbursements over four years.  Sri Lanka's economy has been hit hard by the pandemic, rising energy prices, populist tax cuts and inflation of more than 50%. A shortage of medicines, fuel and other essentials also helped to push the cost of living to record highs, triggering nationwide protests which overthrew the government in 2022. Sri Lanka's central bank outlined the extent of the country's economic crisis earlier this year. According to its latest annual report, ""several inherent weaknesses"" and ""policy lapses"" helped to trigger the severe economic problems that engulfed the South Asian nation.  The central bank also forecast that the Sri Lankan economy would shrink by 2% this year, but expand by 3.3% in 2024. Its prediction is more optimistic than that of the IMF, which forecast economic growth of 1.5% in Sri Lanka next year. Additional reporting by Archana Shukla"
Volatility,Regulator reveals water firms with worst finances,2024-09-25,2023-10-26,By Michael Race,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-67225011,"Thames, Southern, SES and South East have been named as the water firms with the worst financial performance in the UK.  Regulator Ofwat said the companies had been told fix holes in their finances and were being closely monitored. It comes after doubts were raised about the future of Thames Water, the UK's largest supplier, earlier this year due to its £14bn debt pile. At the time, Ofwat was accused of being ""complacent"" in overseeing the sector.  The regulator, which rejected those claims, has vowed to keep a close eye on water company finances and said on Thursday that Thames was among a group of suppliers singled out as having ""significant issues to address"". The four firms were all taking action to ""strengthen long term financial resilience"", it said.  Responding to Ofwat's findings, Thames Water said its network had come ""under unprecedented pressure"" over the past year from record temperatures, a drought and a cold snap. Inflation had also affected its performance. ""In short, our performance was not as we - or our customers - wanted it to be. Despite this, we are in a robust financial position and maintain a strong liquidity position, including £3.6bn of cash and committed funding,"" a spokesperson said. SES said its business was ""financially resilient"" and that its shareholders had committed to investing £7m into the company over the next five years. Southern Water said its new leadership team was ""continuing to deliver"" on a turnaround plan, adding that funds from its majority shareholder boosted the company with an additional £550m of equity earlier this month. Ofwat said it would keep a closer watch on four other suppliers with potential problems: Affinity Water, Northumbrian Water, Portsmouth Water and Yorkshire Water. Fears over financial management in the sector have come as many water companies face heavy criticism due to sewage discharges and leaks.  Last month, Ofwat ordered water companies to pay back £114m to customers through lower bills after missing key targets. The regulator said firms paid out a total of £1.4bn in dividends to shareholders in the most recent financial year, but that there were ""some companies that did not fully meet our expectation in explaining dividend decisions and payments"". ""Dividends are an important part of the investor return however they must take account of performance delivered to customers and the environment,"" Ofwat said. Thames Water, which has 15 million customers across London and the South East, faced calls to be nationalised after it ran into trouble, but managed to secure a £750m cash injection from its shareholders to keep going. The company leaks more water than any other supplier in the UK, losing the equivalent of up to 250 Olympic-size swimming pools every day from its pipes.  The company's future came under the spotlight this summer when it emerged it was in talks to secure extra funding, and the firm's chief executive Sarah Bentley stepped down after just two years in the job. Ofwat said on Thursday that the water sector had secured £4.6bn in extra cash from shareholders since 2020 to help boost firms' financial resilience. But David Black, its chief executive, said companies were expected to ""maintain a level of financial headroom so they can manage periods of volatility and meet their obligations to customers and the environment"". ""Where we have seen cause for concern, we have also seen some companies responding to the challenge and we expect them to continue to work on improving their financial resilience,"" he added. Industry body Water UK said resilience was ""an important foundation"" for companies to deliver a planned £96bn of investment ""to ensure the future security of our water supply and to reduce overflow spills into rivers and seas as fast as possible"". ""While dividends are now much lower than they have been previously, they must be set at the right level for attracting billions in new outside funding to cover the upfront cost of improvements,"" a spokesperson added. South East Water declined to comment."
Volatility,Wall Street plunges on growth concerns,2024-09-25,2018-12-04,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46445913,"Wall Street shares tumbled on Tuesday, sending all three major indexes down more than 3% in some of the steepest declines in weeks. The Dow Jones index shed almost 800 points, or 3.1%, to close at 25,027.07.  The S&P 500 ended at 2,700.07, down more than 90 points or 3.24%, while the Nasdaq dropped more than 283 points or 3.8% to 7,158.43. The falls came as a closely-watched financial measure caused alarm about US economic prospects. Increasing doubts that talks between the US and China would defuse trade tensions also fuelled the losses, reversing Monday's rise, which followed optimism about those prospects. The declines extended a period of market turbulence that started in October, after the indexes hit record highs earlier in the summer. The losses touched nearly every sector, with the financial industry suffering the biggest declines.  Analysts said the trigger for Tuesday's falls appeared to be concerns about the ""yield curve"", which measures the difference between the interest rates paid on short-term and long-term US bonds. The gap has narrowed in recent months, as investors demand higher rates of return on short-term debt in anticipation of inflation and rate rises.  At the same time, they are accepting relatively lower rates on long-term debt, in anticipation of limited inflation and slower economic growth over the next decade. The difference between the rates on three-year and five-year debt disappeared on Monday. The move fuelled concerns on Tuesday that the same might happen to the gap between two-year and 10-year bonds - a more significant indicator. Historically, when short-term rates rise above longer rates, it signals a recession may be on the horizon. Analysts at S&P Global Ratings said they expected US economic growth to slow, not necessarily contract, in coming months, as a boost from recent tax cuts and increased government spending fades. However, the firm added that the risk of recession had grown, reflecting ""increased volatility"" in financial markets. On Tuesday, shares in financial companies, which are especially exposed to interest rates, were hardest hit. Firms such as JP Morgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, American Express were among the biggest losers on the Dow, all down by more than 3%. Companies at risk in the trade battle, including Apple and aerospace giant Boeing, also suffered steep declines, amid scepticism that the US and China would retreat from their tariff war. ""It was good while it lasted,"" said Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, referring to Monday's rally. Tweets by US President Donald Trump fed the doubts, as he sent conflicting signals in a series of Twitter posts. ""President Xi and I want this deal to happen, and it probably will. But if not remember... I am a Tariff Man,"" he wrote."
Volatility,"Families may need help with bills, says IMF expert",2024-09-25,2022-01-25,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60128099,"Struggling UK families may need help with energy bills as inflation soars, an International Monetary Fund expert has said. It comes as the IMF predicted that the UK economy will grow more slowly than expected this year as it recovers from the Covid pandemic. The forecast for UK growth in 2022 was cut to 4.7% from 5% in the IMF's latest world economic outlook. However, this will be the fastest in the G7 industrialised nations. It partly reflects a rebound from sharp falls the UK suffered during initial pandemic lockdowns two years ago. The International Monetary Fund is an organisation of 190 countries that works to secure financial stability. Its first deputy managing director, Gita Gopinath, told the BBC that targeted help might be needed to help vulnerable households deal with higher energy bills as they face a cost-of-living squeeze. She said: ""The UK has done very well on the vaccination front, on testing and tracing and so on. ""All that has to be continued. An argument can be made that, especially for instance, in April, as more of the energy price pass-through happens, then that could be a big, sharp increase in the cost of living. ""And one could see a case for very, very targeted help to highly vulnerable households for a short space of time."" Surging food and energy prices drove inflation to 5.4% in the 12 months to December, up from 5.1% the month before, in a blow to struggling families. The International Monetary Fund expressed concern that a Russian invasion of Ukraine could see energy prices go even higher and stay there for longer. Its first deputy managing director, Gita Gopinath, backed the idea of help with spiralling energy bills in the UK. That intervention could be helpful to the Treasury, which is currently deciding what type of help could be given to mitigate a £50-a-month rise in bills. Some MPs want the government to delay its announced rise in National Insurance, especially after lower-than-expected public borrowing figures. The Treasury is believed to be looking instead at focusing support on those most in need. On Tuesday, the IMF sharply downgraded its forecasts for the two biggest global economies - the US and China - citing high energy prices and new Covid curbs among its reasons. Overall, the IMF now expects global growth to go from 5.9% in 2021 to 4.4% in 2022, half a percentage point lower for this year than in its last prediction in October 2021. ""The global economy enters 2022 in a weaker position than previously expected,"" said the IMF report. As the new Omicron Covid-19 variant spread, countries had reimposed restrictions, it added. ""Rising energy prices and supply disruptions have resulted in higher and more broad-based inflation than anticipated, notably in the US and many emerging market and developing economies.  ""And the ongoing retrenchment of China's real estate sector and slower-than-expected recovery of private consumption have limited growth prospects."" The IMF predicted that the higher levels of inflation currently seen in the global economy would go on for longer than it anticipated in its last forecast, persisting for most of 2022. It said supply chain disruptions, energy price volatility and localised wage pressures meant that ""uncertainty around inflation and policy paths"" was high. US economic growth for this year was downgraded by the IMF from 5.2% to 4% after it removed the effects of President Joe Biden's Build Back Better fiscal policy package from its calculations. The legislation is currently stalled in Congress and is unlikely to be enacted in its present form. China's forecast for 2022 was cut from 5.6% to 4.8%. ""In China, disruption in the housing sector has served as a prelude to a broader slowdown,"" the IMF report said. ""With a strict zero-Covid strategy leading to recurrent mobility restrictions and deteriorating prospects for construction sector employment, private consumption is likely to be lower than anticipated."" The IMF said the cut in expectations for global growth also reflected revisions among some other large emerging markets. In particular, the two biggest Latin American economies, Brazil and Mexico, suffered the largest growth downgrades.  Brazil, where far-right President Jair Bolsonaro is seeking re-election later this year, is now expected to grow by just 0.3% in 2022, down from the previous forecast of 1.5%. Mexico also saw a downgrade of 1.2 percentage points and is now predicted to see growth of 2.8%."

Tolent, based on Gateshead's Team Valley, also has offices in Shotton Colliery, County Durham, Stockton and Leeds, employing 404 people. It had been working on developments including the £85.5m Milburngate in Durham, which administrators called ""significantly loss-making"". They said 91 jobs had been retained during the administration process. The company, which was founded in 1983 by John Wood, had been involved in high-profile multimillion-pound projects across the construction sector including Riverside Sunderland and Newcastle's tallest building, Hadrian's Tower. James Lumb and Howard Smith from Interpath Advisory were appointed joint administrators to Tolent plc and five of its operating subsidiaries. Mr Lumb said Tolent had been ""battling severe headwinds"" like many across the UK's building and construction sector, including ""spiralling costs"", labour shortages and the loss of other companies in its supply chain, ""all of which unfortunately resulted in one of its major contracts becoming loss-making"". He said many construction firms were finding access to finance had ""tightened"" across the sector, following the ""tapering off"" of the government's Covid-19 support schemes, and ""in the wake of recent economic volatility"". ""Additionally, after the annual Christmas shut-downs and a cold December, the months of January and February often bring with them a painful cash crunch,"" he added. ""In a sector which typically operates on wafer-thin margins, this can often prove to be insurmountable, and unfortunately, so has been the case for Tolent."" He said the priority over the coming days was to work with key stakeholder to assess options for each of the companies, including what to do with ongoing contracts and live projects. Employees who have lost their jobs will be given support to be able to make claims from the Redundancy Payments Office, he added. Follow BBC North East & Cumbria on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

Volatility,Rescue of Bulb set to cost taxpayers billions more,2024-09-25,2022-03-08,By Simon Jack,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60653751,"Keeping Bulb Energy running will potentially cost taxpayers billions of pounds more than has currently been set aside, government officials have said.  Bulb, which has 1.6 million customers, was quasi-nationalised in late November when it was put into special administration as it buckled under rising wholesale gas prices.   In November, wholesale prices were around £2 per unit.  Since then, prices have been consistently higher than that.  They hit peaks of £4.70 in December and as high as £8 on Monday - 20 times the prices seen last year - during extreme volatility.   At the time Bulb was placed in special administration, the Treasury set aside £1.7bn to purchase the gas required until the end of the tax year in April 2022 by which time it was hoped a buyer would be found for the business.   Government officials have conceded that the prospect of offloading the business to a private buyer seems remote in this environment and that means that taxpayers will be on the hook for a gas bill that energy analysts believe could run to billions of pounds.   A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: ""The Special Administrator of Bulb is obligated to keep costs of the administration process as low as possible, and we continue to engage closely with them throughout to ensure maximum value for money for taxpayers.""  The extreme volatility in energy markets has seen some customers prepared to pay £3,500 a year to fix their energy bills for two years, according to another large energy operator.  That is well above the energy price cap of £1,971 that comes into effect in April but that cap is subject to potential further increases every six months.  Industry analysts estimate the next energy price cap could be set at £3,000 or more from October.   Other energy retailers are reluctant to offer or recommend customers lock in at such high prices as they fear they could be trapped on high tariffs if and when prices return to more normal levels.  Some may be prepared to pay a high price for the peace of mind conferred by knowing what their outgoings will be. Millions of customers will simply be unable to afford energy bills later this year - despite the government's two-stage £9bn energy bill support package.  This will offer consumers a £150 council tax rebate in April and a £200 loan in October to be repaid at £40 a year for the next five years.   "

Volatility,Why is Christmas dinner more expensive this year?,2024-09-25,2017-11-28,By Alex Taylor,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-42152612,"The cost of Christmas dinner is set to increase, with even the UK's cheapest supermarket spread destined to be 16% more expensive than in 2016.  That's according to Good Housekeeping magazine's annual festive food survey which looked at Britain's 10 biggest stores. A Christmas meal for eight people - including 11 essential components, bought at the lowest price available - has risen from £19.82 last year to £23.53 this festive season. Around the table, this equates to £2.94 per head compared with £2.48 last year.  It's worth noting though, of course, that what you end up paying for Christmas dinner will depend on how you shop and how much time you have to do it, as BBC Reality Check discovered previously.   Good Housekeeping also have very specific criteria for the ingredients they choose. Nine of the 11 items are more expensive in their cheapest form, including turkey. The cheapest bird, according to Good Housekeeping is now up to £8.99 from £8 - a 12% increase. Potatoes have seen the biggest jump from 29p for the cheapest bag last year to £1.49 for a comparable amount this time.  Good Housekeeping says it will only accept Maris Piper or King Edward potatoes in its survey and a 1.5kg bag of Maris Piper potatoes from Co-op costing £1.49 is the cheapest price submitted by any retailer that fits its requirements. However, the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board says growers are being paid less for their potatoes this year and the consumer is also paying less - and indeed, a quick comparison site check suggests you can buy 2.5kg of potatoes from many stores for significantly less than £1.49. So, it's all about the type of spuds, it seems. When it comes to dessert, Christmas pudding fans, at least, will be pleased to see a drop in price, but other sweet treats have gone up.  The cheapest pack of six mince pies is 9p more this year, brandy butter is 24p more and it seems you can't get a Christmas cake for less than £3.99 compared with £3 in 2016. Overall, nine supermarkets are more expensive than last year, with Aldi, Morrisons and Iceland all increasing their prices by more than 13%.  Marks & Spencer is the only supermarket whose basket has got cheaper, dropping its prices by more than 20%.  Lidl offers the most cost-effective overall deal for Christmas dinner at £25.53, whilst Waitrose is deemed most expensive at £41.47. The findings from Good Housekeeping represent the biggest year-on-year cost increase since it began its survey nine years ago. This reflects rising food prices across the UK, as the weak pound pushes up import costs. Food inflation hit a three-year high in May, according to the British Retail Consortium, and is now nearing 4.2% - the highest since October 2013. Much of this is down to the ""sterling effect"" - the sharp fall in the value of the pound following the EU referendum. Brexit-induced uncertainty has affected supermarkets, with Sainsbury's, for one, warning about rising costs and falling consumer confidence as it reported a drop in annual profits. The instability has also hit farmers, unsure how to price their goods in the current climate. A National Farmers Union spokesman told the BBC: ""British farmers have been dealing with a lot of uncertainty and price volatility since the vote to leave the EU.  ""But as producers of the raw ingredients for a food and drink sector, farmers are price-takers rather than price-makers; increasing costs on farm, for example, are rarely passed on to the companies buying the farmers' produce."" Steve Dresser, director at Grocery Insight, said the problems are similar for supermarkets from a business perspective: ""The diminished pound means that any supplies bought in Europe are more expensive than they were pre-Brexit when Sterling was stronger. ""Lots of supply agreements are done with a long outlook, which means that deals may have been struck for Christmas well before the result of the referendum was known.  ""Therefore, these supply agreements will reflect the changes in the market and lead to higher prices, despite the retailers best efforts to keep a lid on increases. But festive cheer need not disappear right away. Shoppers can still save by shopping around. ""Bargains are thin on the ground this Christmas, so supermarket choice is crucial,"" said Caroline Bloor, consumer director at Good Housekeeping.  ""A turkey will usually be your biggest outlay, so if you can find quality and value, you'll be off to a great start. Aldi and Lidl have the cheapest one this year. Now is not the time for loyalty - swapping supermarkets is the best way to save.""

""Last year we really noticed the price increase - food, as with everything else, seems to be getting more expensive. ""Our solution as a family was to shop around online and in-store.

Volatility,Tree-planting driving up rural land prices,2024-09-25,2022-04-12,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-61068730,"Land values in Scotland are booming because investors are putting cash into forestry and tree-planting to offset carbon emissions, a new report says. The Scottish Land Commission said exceptionally high demand and low supply meant prices had risen sharply. The report said there was more demand for smaller farms because of the lifestyle attractions. And more corporate money - often from overseas - was looking for environmental investments. The Scottish Land Commission (SLC) is a Scottish government agency which looks at the concentration of land ownership and its effective use. Hamish Trench, from the SLC, said the report showed that demand for rural land from different types of buyer had increased significantly and was raising prices. The report found a growing number of non-farming investors who were influenced by long-term investment potential as well as ESG (environmental, social and governance) considerations, which promote a more sustainable corporate approach.  It said farmland values had risen by 31.2% in Scotland in 2021 compared with 6.2% across UK. The Scottish government has a target of 18,000 hectares (44,500 acres) of new woodland each year by 2024/25 in an attempt to offset the effects of climate change. Land reform campaigners have warned of businesses buying up land in Scotland to offset their carbon emissions rather than reducing what they emit. Green laird is a term that has been used to describe a business buying thousands of acres of land to plant with trees to help it achieve net zero - a balance between the carbon emitted into the atmosphere, and the carbon removed from it. Scottish Land & Estates, which represents rural land-based businesses, said it was unsurprising that potential buyers were responding to clear government signals to plant more trees. Land ownership is politically sensitive, in Scotland and in many countries around the world. That's partly because we all use it, but also because it has cultural, environmental and economic heft. Yet for all the hopes of radical land reform when the Scottish Parliament started work in 1999, there remains little to discourage secretive corporate and foreign money from buying up large chunks of Scotland and doing, quite often, not much with it of any use to the wider community. The legislated land reform we've seen is aimed at support for communities to get at least the opportunity to buy land when it comes on the market. But today's report points to a sharp increase in off-market deals, which give those communities no chance of putting their case and their finance together. There are several reasons for doing deals without transparency, in addition to subversion of that legal intent; it works for brokers to shift assets on their books to known investors on their books: some farmers don't want their neighbours to know they are ""selling out"" for forestry, which carries social disapproval in some farming circles. The buyers of estates used to want prestige and private lodges with bounteous space for hunting, shooting and fishing. Such owners tend to hang on to their land for a long time, and across generations.  Demand for property far outstrips supply, which is the simple explanation for prices soaring. However, this report suggests that there is ""declining social acceptability of driven grouse shooting"". Investors in the 2020s, typically younger, are more focused on land as a means of getting to net zero - as investment for forestry planting or existing woodland, either of these mean owners can offset their carbon emitting activities elsewhere. That's why a company such as Brewdog and its ""punk"" equity investors own a Highland estate, and new investment vehicles are joining it.  With land, the company or investor can get a certified store of carbon roughly equal, it is claimed, to the emissions from burning natural gas in the process of brewing beer in Ellon. This follows the policy of Westminster and Holyrood governments to boost tree planting on a massive scale. And it helps that the poor quality of land across much of Scotland is of much higher value for forestry than for grouse moor and sheep grazing. As the prices for upland farms rise relative to more productive agricultural land further down the strath, upland hill farmers can sell up to rich investors, and buy a smaller holding with which to change the way they farm. Part of the demand for Scottish farms is also coming from English farmers selling up at higher values and with tax advantages from doing so. This could have profound implications for rural Scotland. A rapid shift in the market that could bring major changes in the way Scotland looks, and in the type of jobs to be found in rural Scotland. One of the challenges is for communities, and the agencies that represent them, to engage with new owners to ensure there is a social dimension to their investing, which engages local people. The other challenge is to those who set policy on land ownership, notably at Holyrood: how much are they letting this shift in the market determine the future of Scottish land, ownership and farming? And what more do they need to do to have the policies, financial incentives and laws in place to achieve a broad mix of ownership and the best possible environmental and social outcomes for the nation? The report recognises that there is an element of speculation in the land market as investors look for a safe haven in a turbulent global economy and gamble on future carbon values rising.  Strong growth in land values is expected to continue due to continued low supply and high demand driven by the long-term policy on climate change and increasing pressure on the global timber market. In the Scottish estates market there was an estimated 87% increase on prices paid in 2020, and last year two estates sold for more than £20m, while five sold for between £10-£20 million.  About one third of buyers were from overseas. Mr Trench said: ""The way the land market functions is important to Scotland's ambitions such as net zero, nature restoration, repopulation, and community empowerment.   ""Being able to participate in the market shapes not just who owns Scotland's land, but who is able to make decisions and who benefits from land and its economic, social and environmental value."" Sarah-Jane Laing, chief executive of Scottish Land & Estates, which represents rural land-based businesses, said: ""It is unsurprising that potential buyers are responding to clear government signals to plant more trees and sequester more carbon as part of a global effort to tackle climate change.  ""Long-term investment in forestry is attractive to landowners and farmers as there is less volatility compared with some markets for farming produce.  ""However, as stated in the report, carbon is only the motivation for some buyers and it is clear that from this small sample of land sales that about half of buyers are acquiring estates and land for other reasons."""
Volatility,Government spending falls as income hits £1bn,2024-09-25,2023-05-05,By Freddie Miller,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-jersey-65495543,"Jersey's government had a higher income and spent less than it had expected in 2022, resulting in a surplus of £104m. Newly published accounts show that, for the first time, the States of Jersey's net annual income was more than £1bn. But amid global economic volatility, the value of the government's investments fell by 6.5%. Treasury Minister Ian Gorst said the report showed ""continuing progress on long-term finance sustainability and stability"". The government's net annual income reached £1.03bn, helped by increases of 12% in income tax and 11% in GST payments compared with figures for 2021. Treasurer Richard Bell said the increases were the result of inflation and interest rate rises, which had pushed up average earnings and the cost of goods and services. But the States of Jersey received 11% less in Stamp Duty, as property sales slowed towards the end of the year. And Impots Duties, the taxes on the sale of alcohol and tobacco, fell by 17% compared with the previous year. The government spent less in 2022 at £873m than in 2021 and 2020, when spending was £888m and £919m respectively. This was predominantly due to a 61% fall in the amount spent on the response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Despite this, each government department, with the exception of the Treasury, saw spending increases. And staff costs rose by 7% to £512m, as the States of Jersey's headcount increased to 7,147 full-time equivalent roles by the end of the year. Having risen by 10.3% throughout 2021, the value of the government's investments fell by 6.5% in 2022. The Strategic Reserve, commonly known as The Rainy Day Fund, dropped 3.9% in value, to £922m. However, the government stressed that it was a long-term investor, and investment valuations had increased by 4.5% in the first quarter of 2023. It reported net assets of £7.9bn ""despite challenging investment conditions impacting our investment returns over the short term"". Mr Gorst said: ""Income was better than anticipated, expenditure lower than estimated and borrowing relating to Covid has been completely repaid. ""However, we still face many financial pressures and need to return to prudence and live within our means."" Follow BBC Jersey on Twitter and Facebook.

Volatility,US shares regain ground to close higher,2024-09-25,2018-02-06,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42957834,"US stock markets have ended a day of massive fluctuations on a high note, rebounding  after recent steep losses.   The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 2.3%, while the Nasdaq hit 2.1% and the S&P 500 rose 1.7%. Stocks shuttled between positive and negative territory throughout the day, their activity spanning more than 1,000 points. On Monday, the Dow had plunged by nearly 1,200 points or 4.6%, triggering losses in Asia and Europe.  ""I think what you're seeing today is, 'Hold on. This got overdone'. The fundamentals of the companies haven't changed since Friday,"" said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at online brokerage TD Ameritrade.  Analysts have said for months that the financial markets were due a correction after a long period of rising prices.  Investors are also fretting over the prospect of rising interest rates, which push up borrowing costs for companies and consumers. The steep sell-off began last week after data in the US showed stronger than expected wage growth. The report came amid other shifts, including new tax cuts, trade tensions, and a sinking dollar, that analysts say could lead inflation to rise faster than expected. The conditions pose a challenge for the Federal Reserve, which will need to raise interest rates to counter inflation, without moving so aggressively that it severely curbs economic activity. It is not clear how the changing economic currents, including tax cuts, will affect company financials ultimately, said Michael Bapis, managing director of The Bapis Group at Hightower, a wealth management firm in New York. ""You're seeing that volatility now because there's uncertainty,"" he said. Earlier on Tuesday, Japan's Nikkei 225 closed down 4.7%. Markets in London, Frankfurt and Paris had initial losses of up to 3%, before recovering some ground.   London's FTSE 100 closed down almost 200 points or 2.6% at 7141. Frankfurt's Dax and Paris's CAC were down 2.3% and 2.4% respectively. On Monday the FTSE 100 closed at its lowest level since April of last year. The falls follow some good years for investors. In 2017 the Dow in the US was up 25% and London's FTSE 100 rose 7.6%. Monday's decline was the largest in percentage terms for the Dow since August 2011, when markets dropped in the aftermath of ""Black Monday"" - the day Standard & Poor's downgraded its credit rating of the US.  US markets opened sharply lower again on Tuesday, but quickly rebounded amid frantic trade that continued throughout the day. Analysts have said the swings in the US markets in part reflect big investors moving to sell stocks and put money in other assets, such as bonds, which benefit from higher interest rates. Other companies that had strategies betting on calm markets also had to adjust. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he did not think the declines were a sign of broader problems. ""There are no systemic issues,"" he told a congressional panel on Tuesday. ""I don't think these types of moves, given how much the market has rallied, have financial stability concerns."" Even if you don't own shares directly, the chances are that you will be paying into a pension which is invested in shares and bonds. More than nine million people in the UK have auto enrolment pensions, and 12 million are active members of defined contribution schemes. That means the value of the pension is dependent on the value of the investments in it. Similarly, anyone who owns shares or funds in an ISA or a SIPP will have seen the value of their savings fall. But experts point out that investments rise and fall over time, and over the longer term, it should make little difference. ""It is effectively no change for normal investors, in that you have ridden a wave on the way up, so now is not the time to cash in,"" said Rebecca O'Keefe, head of investment at Interactive Investor. ""This is unwelcome news, but it is fundamentally a not unexpected reaction to the euphoria that saw markets rise so fast."" If you are planning on retiring in the next couple of months, you will have a slightly smaller pension pot than you did at the start of the year. But coincidentally the FTSE 100 is at almost exactly the same place it was a year ago, so you won't have lost anything over that longer term. Furthermore if you have a while to go before you retire, the shares in your pension fund have just become cheaper to buy - so there is a greater chance of them increasing in value. But, as ever, future market trends are difficult to determine. ""Markets are capricious beasts in the short term, and, looking forward, stock prices could move in either direction without defying the laws of statistics,"" said Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. ""However, in the long term, markets are more reliable in generating growth, and so anyone saving for retirement should still consider the stock market as a friend, not a foe."" Analysts say that in the short term, investors should be prepared for choppier stock markets, but doubt whether there will be a prolonged period of selling. Jane Sydenham, investment director at the stockbrokers Rathbones, said the recent moves were a ""correction"" rather than a crash. ""What we have to remember is stock markets have had a very smooth ride upwards and we've not had a fall of more than 3% for 15 months. There's been a real lack of volatility, which is very unusual."" She added that bear markets - when shares go into a long period of decline - tend to happen ahead of a recession and at the moment growth forecasts were being upgraded. And analyst Laith Khalaf, of Hargreaves Lansdown, pointed out that, despite the heavy falls on Wall Street, the benchmark Dow Jones share index is still 20% up on where it stood this time last year."
Volatility,Manx Utilities declined gas buy over credit issue,2024-09-25,2022-04-13,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-isle-of-man-61082191,"The Isle of Man's utilities provider refused to forward-purchase gas for the island's supplier in October as the company was deemed to be a ""credit risk"", it has been confirmed. Manx Gas (MG) chief executive Jo Cox said a request to Manx Utilities (MU) for ""hedging was declined"". Hedging is buying gas when prices are lower to cushion any impact of rises. MU said MG failed to supply requested information to allow it to assess the financial risk of forward-purchasing. Volatility in the wholesale gas market has been blamed for two recent hikes in gas tariffs on the island. All of the natural gas purchased for sale on the island by MG is done via MU. The amount that may have been saved through hedging at the time of the refusal has not been revealed. However, Ms Cox confirmed that during 2021 and 2022, it had ""delivered a saving of £2.2m"", which was 10% of the gross value of the gas. In a statement, MU said MG ""was considered a credit risk"" at the time as it failed to supply information that would have enabled MU to ""understand the financial risk it was being exposed to following a significant increase in wholesale energy costs"". The decision had been ""considered regularly since"" by MU's board, ""most recently on 25 March"", it added. Ms Cox told Tynwald's Economic Policy Review Committee the ""reticence"" in MU hedging was that it would give the company ""in effect free credit, because they buy forward on our behalf"". ""Forward-buying gas is millions and millions of pounds [and] at that time they were concerned that we wouldn't be able to pay that back,"" she said. A new regulatory framework approved by Tynwald in March had since given the company ""stability"", and had opened the door to hedging through banks, she added.

Volatility,Sinn Féin tops poll in Irish general election,2024-09-25,2020-02-09,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-51432660,"Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald has described the Irish general election as ""something of a revolution in the ballot box"". Counting is continuing and the first results have come in, with Sinn Féin winning the most first preference votes. With all first preferences counted, it has 24.5% compared to 22.2% for Fianna Fáil and 20.9% for Fine Gael. No one party will win enough seats for an outright majority. Before the election, both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil ruled out forming a government with Sinn Féin, citing its tax policies and IRA past as deterrents. On Sunday evening taoiseach (Irish PM) and Fine Gael leader Leo Varadkar said it would be ""challenging"" to form a government. Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin did not rule out working with Sinn Féin, but said ""significant incompatibilities"" still existed. Polling in the election closed at 22:00 local time on Saturday.  Ballot boxes from across the 39 constituencies were opened at 09:00 on Sunday. Many counts have finished for the night and will resume at 10:00 on Monday, but some are continuing. Sinn Féin ran 42 candidates across the 39 multi-seat constituencies, about half that of both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, which will have a knock-on effect on the number of seats it can secure in the 160-seat Dáil (Irish parliament) where 80 seats are needed for a majority. Once the final number of seats for each party is known, leaders will try to form a coalition government in order to avoid another general election. Before the election both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil said they would not enter coalition with Sinn Féin.  Arriving at the RDS count centre in Dublin on Sunday afternoon, Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said she was exploring options to see if it would be possible to form a government without either Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil.  Fine Gael leader Leo Varadkar said his party has consistently ruled out forming a coalition with Sinn Féin ""in large part because of their policies in relation to crime, tax and the way the economy and society should be run and also our deep concerns about their democratic structures. ""We don't believe a coalition between Sinn Féin and Fine Gael is a viable option,"" he said.  He said a ""forced marriage would not result in a good government."" Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin did not rule out working with Sinn Féin, but said ""significant incompatibilities"" still existed. He said reports suggested that his party ""would be the largest"". He added that he was a ""democrat"" and respected the vote of the people. Following the last election in 2016 Sinn Féin had 23 seats in the Dáil (Irish parliament). There are 160 seats up for election this time around, and Sinn Féin is set to dramatically increase how many it holds after it won the most first preference votes. Ms McDonald said this election was about ""change"".  She topped the poll in her four-seat Dublin Central constituency. ""The frustration people have felt for a long time with the two-party system, whereby Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil handed the baton of power between each other - that's now over,"" she said. ""We now have a very substantial mandate."" She said she was exploring options to see to see if it was possible to form a government without Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil. By Chris Page, BBC News Ireland Correspondent Sunday evening is seeing a cascade of results from across the country.  Many early victories have gone to Sinn Féin - with no part of the country looking untouched by the party's surge.  While the general picture is becoming clear - the final numbers will be determined by the process of numerical preferences trickling down through the various stages of the counts.  Sinn Féin surpluses will be very much in play here - as the party was only running one candidate in many constituencies, the destination of the transfers from the successful runners is set to have an impact on what other parties take the seats.  The latest seat projection by University College Dublin, for RTÉ, puts Fianna Fail as the largest party on 45 seats - with Sinn Féin on 37 and Fine Gael on 36. Plenty of counting is still to come.  Fine Gael has been in government since 2011, firstly with the Labour Party and then with independents and with a confidence and supply deal with Fianna Fáil. It looks set to lose seats for the second election in a row, but that does not necessarily rule it out of forming another government. Its share of first precence votes dropped from 25.5% at the last election to 20.9%. Party leader Leo Varadkar reiterated that he did not want to enter into government with Sinn Féin and said Ms McDonald had not been in contact with him. The taoiseach said he was ""not really"" disappointed that he did not top the poll in his own constituency. He did get an increase in his votes compared to the last election. He added it was now clear there was now a ""three-party system"". Fianna Fáil has been in government for more years than anyone else since Ireland became independent, but it has not been the ruling party since 2011. Earlier on Sunday Micheál Martin said reports suggested his party ""would be the largest"" but that it was early days. He said there was a lot of ""volatility"", adding people who could not get elected in the local elections had been successful in this one. He said the most important thing when forming a government was ""compatibility in the programme for government"" and that formation of a government was going to be very difficult. Mr Martin added he was a ""democrat"" and respected the will of the people. Despite previously saying he would not govern with Sinn Féin he has now not ruled that out. The Green Party is also set to increase the number of seats it holds. Green leader Eamon Ryan, who was elected on the first count for Dublin Bay South, said his party would play its part in talks to form a government. Ruth Coppinger from the left wing alliance Solidarity-People Before Profit lost her seat. Labour Party leader Brendan Howlin said it had not been a good day for his party as it had been squeezed by Sinn Féin.  The party's former leader Joan Burton lost her seat in Dublin West. She was first elected to the Dáil in 1992. The Social Democrats co-leader Catherine Murphy said it was ""historic,"" saying there had been a ""seismic shift"". She said she knew there was a wind in the Sinn Féin sail. The Green Party secured 7.1% of first preference votes, followed by Labour (4.4%), Social Democrats (2.9%), Solidarity-People Before Profit (2.6%). Aontú (1.9%) independents (12.2%) and others (1.3%) accounted for the rest. An exit poll - commissioned jointly by Irish national broadcasters RTÉ and TG4, as well as The Irish Times and University College Dublin suggested a move toward Sinn Féin among younger voters, with the party receiving the largest number of first preference votes among 18-24 years olds (31.8%). The majority of voters over the age of 65 appear to have given their first preference to Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil. Ireland's elections are carried out under the proportional representation (PR) voting system, using the single transferable vote (STV). Voters wrote ""1"" opposite their first choice candidate, ""2"" opposite their second choice, ""3"" opposite their third choice and so on. This means that the picture presented when the first preference votes are counted does not completely reflect the final outcome.  Newly elected TDs will gather on 20 February . The ceann comhairle, or speaker, is automatically re-elected. In most situations, the speaker does not vote, so a government will need 80 TDs to hold a majority."
Volatility,Turkey pledges action to calm markets,2024-09-25,2018-08-12,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45165629,"Turkey has pledged it will take action to calm markets after the lira plunged to a new record low in Asian trading.  The details would be unveiled shortly, the country's finance minister told Turkish newspaper Hurriyet. ""From Monday morning onwards our institutions will take the necessary steps and will share the announcements with the market,"" Berat Albayrak said. The lira lost 20% of its value versus the dollar on Friday.  It had already fallen more than 40% in the past year. The  latest blow came on Friday, when US President Donald Trump said he had approved the doubling of tariffs on Turkish steel and aluminium. Concerns about contagion prompted investors to sell riskier assets on Monday including emerging market currencies and stocks in Asia. Mr Albayrak said the country would ""act in a speedy manner"" and its plan included help for the banks and small and medium-sized businesses most affected by the dramatic volatility in the lira. His assurance came after Turkey's president blamed the lira's plunge on a plot against the country. ""What is the reason for all this storm in a tea cup? There is no economic reason... This is called carrying out an operation against Turkey,"" he said. Recep Tayyip Erdogan once again urged Turks to sell dollars and buy liras to help boost the currency.  ""I am specifically addressing our manufacturers: Do not rush to the banks to buy dollars... You should know that to keep this nation standing is... also the manufacturers' duty,"" he said. Experts have blamed the drop in the lira on fears that Turkey may be falling into an economic crisis. The Turkish stock market has also fallen 17%, while government borrowing costs have risen to 18% a year. Meanwhile, inflation has hit 15%. Investors are worried that Turkish companies that borrowed heavily to profit from a construction boom may struggle to repay loans in dollars and euros, as the weakened lira means there is now more to pay back. Then there are Turkey's worsening relations with the US.  Donald Trump's administration hit Turkey's justice and interior ministers with sanctions last week. The dispute centres on Turkey's refusal to release American pastor Andrew Brunson. Mr Brunson has been detained for nearly two years, accused him of links to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party and the Gulenist movement, which Turkey blames for a failed coup in 2016. Trump's decision to double US tariffs on Turkish steel and aluminium has only exacerbated the situation.  Not much yet.  Turkey's finance minister said they would start implementing an action plan on Monday but gave no further details. Some would like to see Turkey's central bank increase interest rates. Not only would this help contain inflation but it would also help support the lira. But there are fears that Mr Erdogan, who is famously averse to interest rate rises, may be pressuring the central bank not to act. Early last month, he claimed the exclusive power to appoint the bankers that set interest rates - and to cement his control he has put his son-in-law in charge of economic policy. Mr Erdogan favours lowering borrowing costs to fuel credit growth and economic expansion. Investors are worried that Turkish companies could struggle to repay loans in dollars and euros - a debt pile that only grows as the lira falls. Over a third of Turkish banks' lending is in foreign currencies, according to Reuters. Concerns about contagion were recently reinforced by a report in the Financial Times saying that the European Central Bank is concerned about the exposure of eurozone banks to Turkey. In particular, the report flags that Spain's BBVA, Italy's UniCredit and France's BNP Paribas, all of which have significant operations in Turkey, are especially exposed. Eight years ago, concerns about contagion during the eurozone debt crisis saw investors push up the borrowing costs of highly indebted eurozone countries, exacerbating their debt problems.  There are already signs that contagion is spreading, with investors selling riskier assets on Monday. Emerging market currencies fell on along with the lira, while Asian stocks fell across the board."
Volatility,New York Stock Exchange closes trading floor,2024-09-25,2020-03-18,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51954868,"The trading floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is set to shut in the latest coronavirus-related closure. The Intercontinental Exchange, which operates the NYSE, said all buying and selling of shares will happen electronically from 23 March.  Much of the trading is already electronic. It comes after some staff had tested positive for the virus. US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin has suggested Wall Street could limit trading hours due to the pandemic. Mr Mnuchin's proposal followed weeks of market turmoil, with wild swings in share prices dragging indexes down roughly 30% from their recent highs. However, New York Stock Exchange President Stacey Cunningham said markets do not need to close. ""While we are taking the precautionary step of closing the trading floors, we continue to firmly believe the markets should remain open and accessible to investors,"" she said. ""All NYSE markets will continue to operate under normal trading hours despite the closure of the trading floors."" Ms Cunningham had previously defended the decision to keep the floor open, telling broadcaster CNBC that having people execute and manage trades helped to reduce volatility.  However, in recent days New York has ordered gathering places such as gyms, bowling alleys, theatres, bars and restaurants to shut. It has also closed schools and banned gatherings of more than 50 people. On Wednesday, Governor Andrew Cuomo mandated no more than 50% of staff report to work at non-essential businesses. When the New York Stock Exchange has shut its doors on previous occasions, such as after the September 11 2001 attacks, that has closed markets.  But today, only about 18% of buying and selling happens via the the trading floor, which is a mix of brokers with clients and representatives from major companies. CME Group, which operates other exchanges, announced last week that it was shutting its in-person trading floor. At the time, it said no cases had been reported. Cboe Global Markets made a similar move. It is not surprising the floor of the New York Stock Exchange is closing. It was never a matter of ""if"" but ""when.""  Most of the work done by traders can be done electronically.  But keeping the floor open had symbolic value, suggesting that despite what turmoil may be unfolding elsewhere, America's economy was still open for business.  However, the NYSE also had to contend with the reality on the ground. New York City is contemplating a ""shelter in place"" for all residents and there are hundreds of people moving on and off the floor every day.  If the idea is to try and contain the virus, keeping the floor open was quickly becoming unrealistic."
Volatility,The rise of unmarried parents in America,2024-09-25,2018-04-25,By Taylor Kate Brown,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-43899553,"A new report finds more than 16 million Americans are raising children without being married - and increasingly doing so with a live-in partner. When Aron Womack and his son moved in with his girlfriend Michelle, they had been dating for almost two years. His lease on an apartment with a fellow divorced dad was up and he and Michelle had already had discussions about joining her at her house. ""It just made sense,"" Womack says. Then they started planning to have children together - four years later they are raising them together - but still have not tied the knot. ""She wanted to have kids and I was totally good with that."" he says. ""I didn't think marriage was a barrier.""  Aron and Michelle aren't alone.  In 1968, 88% of unmarried parents were solo mothers. As of last year, that number had fallen to 53%. But there's not a sudden rise of single dads - the change is entirely made up of parents who are raising children - and living together - without being married, according to a new report by Pew Research Center. This trend has been ongoing for decades, but in 2017 the percentage of unmarried cohabitating parents reached a new high - 35%.  Overall, most parents in the US are married - 65% of all people who are raising children - but one in three children live in a household where their parent is unmarried (whether it's a solo or two-parent household).  And in total numbers, there are more children being raised by solo mothers and fathers than there were in 1968. Overall marriage rates in the US have dropped significantly in the past 40 years, and the age of first marriage is rising.  Stephanie Coontz, director of research at the Council of Contemporary Families, says the change follows a combination of trends - a rise in both the expectations of what marriage means, and the likelihood of divorce - making it a ""high-risk, high-reward"" situation that some are reluctant to enter; a greater ability to raise children outside of marriage, as well higher inequality and volatility among lower-income Americans, which reduces the ability to plan long-term. ""People do think that marriage is a less sacred institution than it used to be, but a more sacred relationship,"" she says.  ""So if the relationship is what is sacred and valuable - you don't have to stay it if it ends - versus if you think the institution is more important."" Coontz says its unclear if some of the growing share of unmarried parent couples will eventually get married - a pattern often seen in Scandinavian countries.  ""The irony is the people who are most likely to say it's not a moral choice to get married, are the wealthy people who are more likely to get married."" Unmarried parents living together tend to be younger, less likely to have ever been married and have more children than solo parents, according to the Pew report. They are also less likely to be living in poverty. While cohabitating parents have been more common, American attitudes towards two people raising children together without being married is not strongly positive. A 2015 survey by Pew found 48% of adults thought the trend of more unmarried couples raising children was ""bad for society"". Two-thirds felt the same way about the rise of single mothers. Aron asked Michelle to marry him after their first child was born but ""it's a coin flip"" whether it will happen, he says. Relatives and friends sometimes ask the couple when they are getting married but he says it doesn't bother him.  ""The only grief I've every gotten was from her grandparents."" ""It really wouldn't matter either way"" if they were married, Aron says, although he adds there would be a few legal things that would be easier, including insurance.  ""We basically live like any other married couple."""
Volatility,Investment boss in tearful video apology,2024-09-25,2018-11-21,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46295109,"The boss of a Florida-based financial firm has made a tearful video apology to clients after bad bets on oil and natural gas prices wiped out their investments. James Cordier blamed a recent bout of market volatility for the losses, which are set to destroy his firm. ""I truly invested your funds like you were family,"" he said in the 10-minute video posted on YouTube. ""I'm sorry that this rogue wave capsized our boat."" Natural gas prices enjoyed their biggest one-day percentage gain in eight years on Wednesday last week, only to suffered their largest one-day loss in 15 years the very next day. Meanwhile, oil prices have also fallen sharply. Mr Cordier is president of OptionSellers.com, based in Tampa, and co-wrote a book called The Complete Guide to Option Selling. The company managed money for wealthy investors and specialised in options, which give investors the right to buy or sell at a pre-determined price. OptionSellers said the losses were its ""clients' private business. We are in communication with them."" It was not clear how much money the firm managed or the size of the losses. Mr Cordier said in his video that he had 290 clients. However, the losses could total more than $150m, according to Ohio lawyer Jason Albin, who has been in contact with about 80 clients. Mr Albin said he thought the trades, which in some cases involved retirement accounts, should not have been permitted because of the risk involved.  He is looking at taking legal action against INTL FCStone, the brokerage that cleared the bets on behalf of Mr Cordier's company. INTL FCStone declined to comment on the claims. The firm said accounts managed by Optionsellers.com were liquidated after ""unprecedented volatility"" in the oil and gas markets last week. ""Although well collateralized, accounts managed by a commodities trading advisor, Optionsellers.com, had to be liquidated as a result of these moves,"" the company said. ""Liquidation of these accounts was in accordance with our customer agreements and our obligations under market regulation and standards."""
Volatility,Gas pressure builds further,2024-09-25,2022-01-16,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-60016038,"Monday brings a big moment for Scotland's energy transition. Winners in the auction for 15 ScotWind sea areas will be announced. Covering 8,600 square kilometres, the announcement starts the process of a gigantic effort to put as many as 1,200 turbines out at sea. Many will be of the pioneering floating variety, giving us much more marine wind potential in deeper water. They should, on average production, generate around twice the electricity Scotland needs, though that demand will rise as the nation transitions from carbon fuels to far more electricity use. Faith in that transition is being shaken by the exceptionally high costs for energy coming down the pipeline. Prices are already up. Household bills have been capped, and that cap is likely to rise by about 50% from April. There's no way out of the rising bills. Ofgem, the regulator, is obliged by law to pass on the costs of sourcing energy. We'll find out on 7 February just how high they are going to rise in spring, with the new price cap reflecting the recent soaring price of natural gas. There are ways to mitigate that rise. The government could cut 5% VAT, though that would make only a limited difference, and the biggest part of the tax giveaway would be to well-off people who use the most energy.  Cutting tax, when it is already only a quarter of the VAT rate for most goods and service, would run counter to the net-zero policy of reducing use of fossil fuels. Alternatively, governments - in Holyrood as well as Westminster - could use their resources to offset the impact on the households in most fuel poverty, by expanding the size and reach of welfare benefits, most obviously the £140 per year Warm Homes Discount on bills. With around £600 to £700 extra being loaded onto the annual average bill from April, that would have to be a big uplift to provide the support many people will need. Or government at Westminster could guarantee loans to energy suppliers so that they continue to absorb the increased cost of wholesale gas and electricity, and smooth the effect of the higher input costs.  But that assumes there will be lower wholesale and other costs from spring onwards: that last autumn and this winter have seen exceptional spikes in prices, and we'll return to energy trading to normal.  That's a bold assumption. Here's why, and here are some factors to watch over the next few months. Gas has gone global.  It used to be bought in forward contracts along pipelines, suiting suppliers and customers. The market was regional, dictated by the limitations of pipelines. That has changed.  While a lot of gas is bought on the forward market - a guaranteed price to deliver in a set number of months after the contract is struck - a higher proportion of it is now traded in the volatile spot market. That's the price for delivery the month after next, that has gone from less than 50p a therm for years, to more than £4 in a recent spike. It has since fallen to below £2, but continued volatility is expected. The fall since the start of the year is partly because of the arrival in European ports of ocean-going tankers loaded with LNG, liquified natural gas. These ships, from Qatar or the Gulf of Mexico, go where the price paid is highest, and that's anywhere around the world. So when economies are back to growth in Asia, they bid up the price of the LNG shipments. There's unfinished business back in Britain. We are yet to pay the price of rescuing nearly 30 companies that ceased trading since September.   The average cost of each customer being taken on by one of the surviving companies is estimated at around £1,000. That's the cost of buying further gas supplies for new customers in the market, at a much higher spot price than customers are currently paying.  It also includes the repayment of account credit balances built up by customers over last summer. The deceased suppliers burned through those balances in trying to keep buying on that fast-rising short-term wholesale market.  Surviving suppliers expect to recoup that cost through the Supplier of Last Resort (SoLR) system, and that can be expected to appear in bills from next autumn. So with forward prices for gas in the winter of 2022-23 currently in the region of £2 per therm (four times the price a year ago), and with those extra costs being loaded on, industry insiders say prices will either stay high or they could go a further £500 or £600 higher from October. The energy market is changing. The exceptionally low level of wind across Europe during much of 2021 meant there was a need for back-up, also known as baseload.  Nuclear plants, such as Hunterston, are being closed and in Britain, they are replaced very slowly or not at all. Coal-burning is being shut down. So there is more dependence on gas to provide the baseload supply, meaning demand for gas is up. That has left less of the supply to replenish gas storage. The UK has very little gas storage, preferring to see its upstream primary resource as a form of energy security.  But European countries have lots more storage capacity, and it's been running very low for months. The coming summer will need to see the stocks built up again for next winter. That will require a return to normal wind speeds and a steady supply of gas… which brings us to Vladimir Putin. Europe depends heavily on Russia - Britain much less so, but its gas prices are heavily influenced by demand and supply across Europe. While Norway has stepped up supply through a growing number of pipelines, Russia is in a high-stakes geo-political duel with countries it sees as adversaries on its western flank. Its political leadership is threatening a further invasion of Ukraine, at the same time as demanding that the Nato defence alliance pull troops and weapons back from Russia's frontier and that it pledges not to allow further countries to join.  The ultimatum, thrown down just before Christmas, looks as if it's designed to be rejected by a Kremlin administration that wants to crank up the tensions. Russia wants to commission a Gazprom pipeline already installed from Russia to Germany, but that is fiercely opposed by the USA, it has been stalled by Germany, and its future is tied up with events in Ukraine.  Russia says it has fulfilled its contractual commitments to supply gas through other pipelines, but it is accused of controlling the tap on further supplies in order to put political pressure onto the countries that depend on it. Such behaviour over the past decade is one of the main reasons customers have diversified supply to LNG and to Norway, but there is still a reliance on Russia and a vulnerability.  And as Russia gets more belligerent, there is more pressure placed on to the LNG tanker market. The early stages of talks between the US and Russia, and then between Nato and Russia, have not shown much sign of reducing this tension. Students of international relations might wonder where the British PM is in this sharply rising period of international tensions, given that the UK has a seat on the UN Security Council and is one of Nato's bigger contributors. The answer: in a career-threatening crisis about partying and boozing in Downing Street. Government policy is for the distribution costs of electricity - the high voltage cabling and local distribution networks - to be shifted on to gas. That is part of the response to global warming, and the pledge to get to net zero.  The idea is to create a strengthening incentive to shift from gas to electricity. Given current price rises, that doesn't look imminent. But it remains policy. That drive towards net zero was given a lot of impetus by the COP26 gathering in Glasgow last November. You may recall that conference nearly foundered on the issue of whether coal was to be ""phased out"" or, in the words of the final agreement ""phased down"". What followed some weeks later was a report from the International Energy Agency, showing that burning of coal reached new records last year.  China and India, in particular, are using coal to fuel economic growth, with China hard hit in recent months by a shortage of power supply. With gas prices high globally, coal has become a financially attractive alternative. Britain has returned to coal-burning to support that electricity baseload - a last gasp in the final years before its coal plants are finally extinguished. COP26 also featured pressure on the British government and others to put a stop to further drilling for oil and gas. The imperative of limiting the rise in global temperatures is reckoned to mean that we have already tapped all the reserves we can allow ourselves to exploit. And yet with both gas and oil prices riding high, investment is back into boom times. Rystad energy consultancy says it is on course to rise from $601bn to $628bn this year. It has not yet returned to pre-pandemic levels, but it is on course to do so by 2024.  As part of that, gas and LNG upstream investments are rising 14% to $149bn. Upstream oil (exploration and production, that is) is rising 7% to $307bn. The campaign to 'keep it in the ground' is not going well."
Volatility,News Daily: Trump 'war games' pledge and Tory Brexit 'concessions' talks,2024-09-25,2018-06-13,By Justin Parkinson,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-44461360,"Hello. Here's your morning briefing: After his summit with North Korea's Kim Jong-un, Donald Trump promised to cancel his country's joint military exercises with South Korea. Now the Pentagon has moved to reassure US allies in eastern Asia that the president retains an ""ironclad"" commitment to maintaining security in the region. Mr Trump's announcement on so-called ""war games"" is seen as a large concession to Mr Kim, who - according to North Korean state media - has accepted an invitation to visit the US. Mr Trump, who called Mr Kim a ""funny guy"", has also been asked to come to Pyongyang. The biggest issue on the table - the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula - was also discussed, with Mr Kim confirming his ""unwavering commitment"" to it. Whatever happens, writes BBC North America reporter Anthony Zurcher, the summit - with all its odd moments - shows that US and international politics ""have been turned upside down"". Korea analyst Jenny Town looks at what has been achieved so far. Theresa May averted a Commons rebellion over plans to give MPs a ""meaningful"" say over a final Brexit deal with the EU. Now Conservative MPs are to discuss in further detail what their role will be if no agreement is reached with Brussels by December. Some MPs say they were offered real ""input"", in a last-minute concession ahead of a key vote on the EU Withdrawal Bill.  But Solicitor General Robert Buckland argued that allowing Parliament to ""instruct"" the government on what to do in the event of no deal would leave the UK in ""very rocky constitutional territory"". BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg says there have been ""very, very dark mutterings"" from those who were ""persuaded by what they thought was a promise"".

Volatility,Public consultation on post-Brexit farming,2024-09-25,2018-08-01,By Conor Macauley,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-45030489,"Plans for the future of farming in Northern Ireland after Brexit have gone out to public consultation.  They include measures to support farms and improve the environment.  The public has until 10 October to give their views.  The current system of EU subsidy payments will no longer apply after 2019. A decision on the shape of the final policy will not be taken until devolved government returns.  It is envisaged that even under domestic arrangements there will be little change until 2022, when a new NI specific system could be introduced.  It is hoped it can improve farmers' productivity, protect their incomes from external shocks like extreme weather or market volatility and encourage them to work in a way which is more environmentally sustainable.  Many farmers rely heavily on support payments for the bulk of their income.  The Ulster Farmers' Union welcomed the consultation but said it was frustrated it had taken so long ""to get the document onto the table"". ""We have to make sure that Brexit is an opportunity for farmers here,"" said president Ivor Ferguson. ""This is an opportunity to create a better system, and it is essential we take this chance to get it right."" The policy paper says such payments can help farms remain viable but can also mask inefficiency.  In coming years it suggests a farm payment which is lower than that currently received and asks for views on the appropriate level.  It also suggests differentiated payments depending on the condition and quality of the land farmed.  Measures could be considered to stop larger farms being overcompensated and prevent money going to non-commercial holdings.  A range of other measures such as income insurance and a deposit scheme, which farmers could save to in good years and draw cash from in bad years, are also suggested.  The new farm policy would encourage farmers to help address significant environmental challenges linked to the industry including water pollution and ammonia emissions which impact biodiversity and sensitive sites.  It says changes in farming practices could deliver ""major gains"" which should be the focus of new proposals.  The policy proposal states farmers should be financially rewarded for providing ""public goods"" like improved biodiversity and asked to help design schemes to do this on a landscape-wide level.  Targets include increases in important habitats and species at favourable status; improved soil and water quality; reduced ammonia emissions and a continuing fall in the carbon intensity of food production.  The paper does not go into detail about what proportion of farm income might be drawn from such schemes.  The policy document also focuses on plans to drive innovation and encourage farmers to share knowledge and get qualifications and training.  There are also proposals to encourage investment and attract young farmers into the industry.  It includes suggestions on a move away from the system of short-term land leasing called conacre to a more efficient system of long term rental. "
Volatility,SSE gas and electricity prices to rise again in NI,2024-09-25,2022-08-26,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-62688553,"The energy company SSE Airtricity is putting up its gas and electricity prices in Northern Ireland again. Gas prices will rise by 28.3% from 1 October and electricity prices will go up by 35.4% from the same date. It comes after Ofgem announced the energy price cap in Great Britain will rise to £3,549 a year from October. However, some consumers in NI will be the equivalent of £1,000 a year better off than customers in the rest of UK, the region's energy regulator has said. The chief executive of the Utility Regulator, John French, has calculated that the equivalent combined gas and electricity customers in Northern Ireland will pay £2,393 a year from October. ""I fully recognise that this differential between Great Britain and Northern Ireland is cold-comfort to those who are struggling here,"" he added. Peter McClenaghan, from the Consumer Council, said Northern Ireland was ""facing into a very serious crisis this winter"" and he is angry and fearful on behalf of consumers. The Consumer Council provides advice to consumers and Mr McClenaghan said that ""already many of our households are at the brink"". ""This announcement means consumers in Belfast face combined annual gas and electricity bills in excess of £2,500 a year, with further price increases to come,"" he said. Other companies will also be putting up their prices as they are buying energy in the same wholesale markets as SSE Airtricity. Those wholesale markets are currently a horror show, suggesting that energy prices will continue rising steeply into the early months of next year. SSE Airtricity is Northern Ireland's largest household gas supplier with about 188,000 customers. Those customers have already seen the price they pay more than double since the spring of last year. The Utility Regulator says the latest increase in the price of gas - the fifth since April 2021 - will be equivalent to another £351 a year. Mr French said the wholesale gas market was ""[continuing] to surge"". ""[It] is producing prices 16 times higher than normal historic rates,"" he said. ""We will continue to do everything in our control to support consumers at this very difficult time."" The announcement by SSE Airtricity comes on the day Stormont Finance Minister Conor Murphy confirmed that the UK government would deliver an energy bill discount of £400 to help households in Northern Ireland that are struggling with the increasing cost of living. But he said there was no guarantee that Northern Ireland households would receive the discount in October, when those in the rest of the UK are due to get it. Donna Dugan, from Carrowdore, County Down, works full-time and cares for her mother Anne, 86, who has vascular dementia and Alzheimer's. She says the price of home heating oil has ""gone up a lot"". ""We got an oil fill up just before the summer period - we normally pay a certain amount every month - and unfortunately this time we were £400 short, which is quite extraordinary for us. ""Over the summer, we have had the heating off completely and we've never had to do that before."" They have also reduced the number of baths Anne has to reduce costs, and she takes more showers instead. Donna says the £400 energy bill discount would make a ""huge difference"". She says it is imperative that ""something is done really urgently"" to tackle the issue. ""I worry that if mummy's situation deteriorates, the impact that will have on my ability to work.  ""I need to work, it's not a choice for me to have reduced hours because we couldn't financially manage. I need to work full-time."" Craig Harrison, of Carers NI, said ""carers are on their knees, financially"".  ""We had the worst rate of carer poverty of anywhere in the UK even before the cost of living crisis began to bite,"" he added. ""Carers' financial situation on all fronts has just deteriorated more and more since then."" He said day-to-day, carers are going hungry, because they cannot afford to buy food. Mr Harrison said they were missing mortgage payments, and borrowing money from friends and family to get by.  ""I'm even aware of female carers having to make their own sanitary products."" SSE Airtricity is also the second largest supplier of household electricity, with about 168,000 customers. They will see their bills rise by the equivalent of another £330 a year. SSE Airtricity managing director Klair Neenan said: ""It was hoped market volatility would ease but the global energy crisis continues to impact gas and electricity costs for all energy suppliers. ""We are acutely aware of the impact this has for households and are working hard to help where we can."" The company said any customer who was concerned or having difficulty with their energy costs should ""please contact us and we will work with you to find a solution together"". Two-thirds of homes in Northern Ireland use oil for their heating. The Consumer Council tracks the price of home-heating oil and its data suggests that prices fell during July, roughly in line with the price of Brent crude oil. But prices have started to increase again in the past two weeks. The Northern Ireland energy market is very different from the rest of the UK for a variety of historical reasons. The electricity market was liberalised much later than the rest of the UK; the former state-owned incumbent still has half the domestic market and there are only a handful of suppliers. The gas network is a relatively recent development and there are still regulated monopoly suppliers in some areas. That means the market is regulated differently from the rest of the UK, for example without the price cap mechanism. Mr French believes that Northern Ireland's simpler market is part of the reason for the lower prices in Northern Ireland. He told BBC News NI: ""We price regulate one company at a time, so we are regulating SEE Airtricity at the moment, that was the announcement today. ""What they are doing in GB in terms of the price cap is looking at the 70 odd companies and try to give an announcement that covers the needs of those 70 companies."" He said that while the GB price cap is forecast to go towards £5,000 in January at the moment he does not see that in the current market for Northern Ireland. It is difficult to give an overall energy cost comparison between Northern Ireland and GB because Northern Ireland is still heavily reliant on heating oil for home heating."
Volatility,Pound surges on Brexit deal hopes,2024-09-25,2019-10-11,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50011444,"Sterling surged on Friday to a three-month high amid investor optimism about a last-minute Brexit deal between Britain and the European Union. Against the dollar the pound rose 1.9% to $1.2682, and against the euro was up 1.67% at €1.1489. The currency has rallied more than 3% since Thursday, its biggest two-day gain since before the June 2016 referendum on leaving the EU. Many UK-focused shares also surged, with Royal Bank of Scotland up 11.6%. On Friday, EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said he had had a ""constructive"" meeting with UK Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay. That followed talks between the Irish and British prime ministers on Thursday, after which a joint statement spoke of ""a pathway to a possible deal"". Deutsche Bank's foreign exchange strategist George Saravelos said he was ""turning more optimistic on Brexit"" and no longer negative on the pound, while JPMorgan said the Anglo-Irish statement may have ""changed everything"". ""The chances of a deal seem to have improved and the pound has moved accordingly but hurdles still remain,"" said Dean Turner, economist at UBS Wealth Management. ""Time to thrash out the details of the deal are tight, and then there is the question of parliamentary approval."" Other analysts cautioned that trading on the financial markets was thin, leading to higher volatility and a sharp jump in some share prices. Meanwhile, another analyst said the price surges were probably due to algorithms driving the market. Following the more confident noises coming from Brussels, London and Dublin, there were hopes that a meeting between British and EU negotiators will pave the way for a Brexit transition deal at a summit on 17-18 October. The rally in sterling undermined the UK's export-heavy FTSE 100 stocks, and the blue chip index itself was up under 0.9%. But shares exposed to UK growth and consumers soared. Housebuilders Persimmon, Barratt and Taylor Wimpey rose more than 10%. Next rose nearly 8.5%, and ITV more than 6%. The more UK-focussed FTSE 250 index was up more than 4%. The yield on 10-year British government bonds was on track for its biggest three-day rise since 2017."
Volatility,Aston Martin boss hits back at the doubters,2024-09-25,2019-03-06,By Russell Hotten,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-47457220,"The boss of Aston Martin Lagonda has delivered a passionate defence of the company's strategy amid signs some city investors are losing faith. Andy Palmer said the company will prove the sceptics wrong, as he stressed the luxury carmaker's long-term plans and importance to UK manufacturing. Aston Martin's shares slumped last week as the UK's only quoted carmaker posted its first results since going public. It comes as Aston rolled out its latest products at the Geneva Motor Show. These include models to take on the likes of Ferrari, Rolls-Royce and Bentley, meaning that James Bond's favourite carmaker will soon be able to compete in all segments of the luxury car market, from hypercars to sports utility vehicles. But Mr Palmer fears that Aston Martin's ""good news message"" is being drowned out. Last month, the shares sank about 20% after the carmaker delivered its maiden set of profit figures. The share price went below £11, having debuted on the London Stock Market last October at £19. One long-time city observer said Aston Martin's very brief life as a public company was so far the worst he had seen in almost 30 years. But Mr Palmer blamed the share price slide and criticism on people who don't understand the long-term investment case.  And because the actual number of shares listed is relatively small, this increases the price volatility. ""My disappointment with last week's reaction is because the results were, in fact, really, really strong,"" he insisted. Mr Palmer wants people to understand Aston Martin's importance to British manufacturing.  ""Everything else has been sold. When everything is sold overseas, when you come to economic downturns it is much easier to switch off a plant if it's not in your home backyard.  ""It's much easier for Honda to close their plant or for Nissan to turn off the X-Trail... because [the HQs] are a long way from home. ""We need to create engineers in the UK; we need to create intellectual property; we need to create apprentices. When you don't own your own industry, you can't guarantee that you can do that."" The UK car industry ""messed up in the 1970s and '80s"", says Mr Palmer, an executive at Nissan before taking the top job at Aston Martin. ""It's a legacy time bomb that has been sitting with us for some time."" The motor show launch included the first car to be produced under the company's revival of the legendary Lagonda marque. Lagonda is being re-launched as an all-electric brand, with the All-Terrain Concept unveiled at the show set to go into production at Aston Martin's new factory at St Athan, Wales, in 2022. The car will line up against the Rolls-Royce Cullinan and Bentley's Bentayga, although Mr Palmer expects his product to be more appealing to millionaire tech entrepreneurs. The car will have a range of about 400 miles, and wireless rapid-charge technology - and cost about £300,000. The Lagonda brand was born in 1899 and ""we need to invigorate it,"" Mr Palmer said. ""It will be the first all-electric vehicle luxury car brand."" Aston Martin also unveiled its Vanquish Vision, a 200-mph supercar to challenge Ferrari's new F8 Tributo and latest Lamborghinis. The Vision's price tag is at least £250,000. Completing the line-up of launches was a £1m hypercar, called the AM-RB 003. It will be put into production in late 2021. Mr Palmer described the unveilings as ""a show of force… It shows our long term story remains strong and on track,"" he told the BBC.  The Geneva displays are part of the company's Second Century strategy to launch one new model a year for seven years. With the launch of a planned new Lagonda sedan, in production from 2023, that strategy will be complete. After that, ""it's copy-repeat, copy-repeat"", he said. He described Second Century as a defensive plan to protect Aston Martin, loss-making for decades, against downturns in the global economic cycle and changing markets. ""We'll have a company more capable of dealing with these things,"" he said. ""My job is to make sure the company is prepared for these events."" Mr Palmer has been a vocal critic of the UK leaving the EU without a deal, putting his head above the parapet long before many other executives. ""The worry is that you get contaminated with the Brexit story."" But he is hopeful an agreement will be done before 29 March because he ""finds it inconceivable that sensible people in Brussels and UK can't find a deal"". There is, of course, the rest of the world to worry about, although Aston Martin's key China and US markets are doing well. He is particularly pleased with the continuing growth in China, where 50% of customers are now female. So-called rich empowered females are an important growth market, including in Saudi Arabia, where driving restrictions on women have been lifted. The company has opened more dealerships in the country. Mr Palmer accepts that Aston Martin still has a macho, perhaps intimidating reputation - a legacy of the 007 connection. But that's more the case in the West, he believes. ""The preconception does not exist in China, which is why we've been able to get to 50%"". But the company still needs to do more to attract women buyers and get them into the showrooms for a test drive, he says. There will be no ""pinking and shrinking"" of the cars, but much more emphasis on marketing and approach. ""We don't want to alienate any potential customer, male or female."" He has set up a female advisory board, made up of the sort of rich empowered females he wants to buy his cars. They meet about once a quarter to advise on everything from car design to car advertising.  ""When men talk about female customers they can sound condescending, even though that's not the intention. The advisory board helps us to get the tone and manner right."" If only setting the right tone and manner among city investors was as easy."
Volatility,'Much to ponder as European golf holds vital meeting',2024-09-25,2023-05-01,Iain Carter,https://www.bbc.com/sport/golf/65443126,"The Marco Simone Golf and Country Club near Rome will host the 44th staging of the biennial Ryder Cup in the autumn While Italy will surely stage some of the year's most iconic golfing moments at September's Ryder Cup, the country this week hosts a meeting vital to the future of European golf. The DP World Tour's tournament committee gathers on Tuesday, before the Italian Open at the Marco Simone Golf and Country Club. It faces a packed agenda largely determined by the current volatility of men's professional golf. With the green light given to the Wentworth-based circuit to allow punishment of players who have moved to the Saudi Arabia-funded breakaway LIV tour, members of the committee have much to ponder. But there are several other issues that will come under consideration, including the prospect of radical schedule changes and more tournaments being co-sanctioned with the European tour's strategic partners in the United States. DP World Tour officials say they have been ""working round the clock"" to establish a new framework. They want to announce their 2024 schedule at July's Genesis Scottish Open - significantly earlier than previous calendar unveilings. Chief Keith Pelley and fellow executives want committee approval on a number of proposals, among them shifting the tour's big tournament emphasis to the northern hemisphere's autumn months. They have no choice given the way the PGA Tour calendar of designated events, building to its Tour Championship finale in August, now dominates the global schedule. Pelley wants to bolster his line up of tournaments from September onwards. This will be when big time golf comes to Europe and the territories that have become traditional heartlands - the Middle East, China and South Africa.  It could mean the prestigious BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth becoming co-sanctioned with the PGA Tour, along the same lines as the Scottish Open. But there are players on the tournament committee who will need convincing. For the Scottish it works well - the Renaissance Club event attracted 14 of the top 15 golfers in the world last year. But the Scottish occurs in a prime slot before The Open and those players see it as an ideal tune up for the final major.  They play happily in the knowledge that they can simultaneously collect potentially crucial PGA Tour play-off points. September in Surrey might not carry the same allure for the biggest names. Top Americans will have just completed an exhausting summer with the prospect of either a Presidents or Ryder Cup to come. Instead of attracting the likes of Scottie Scheffler and Jordan Spieth there is a more likely prospect of the Russell Henleys and Brian Harmans taking their chance to cash in on co-sanctioned spoils. Yes, they are very fine players and would bring reasonable world ranking points to the table, but they are not ticket-selling superstars. Furthermore, they would deny rank and file DP World Tour members places in one of the circuit's most lucrative events. How does that sit with the objective of being a ""members' organisation existing for the benefit of the membership"", as Pelley often reminds us? And in the offing there could be more than just Wentworth as an additional co-sanctioned tournament.   It would also be no surprise to see one of the usual traditional early season Middle East events switching to a much later date - Abu Dhabi potentially moving from January to November, the week before the season finale DP World Tour Championship in Dubai. Make no mistake, the European tour is up against it.  Changes to the world ranking system have made it harder for its players to make significant climbs without playing on the PGA Tour. It is one of the many reasons why the ""pathway"" of giving PGA Tour cards to the leading 10, not otherwise exempt, golfers at the end of the continental season is so attractive. Pelley insists this provides a compelling narrative, others see it as a talent drain. The DP World Tour's diminished rankings status, after recent changes brought in following an independent study of the old Official Golf World Ranking system, will be another topic for the committee to discuss.   ""With a new system there is always challenges,"" Pelley recently told the No Laying Up podcast. ""As a result we are looking at some modification level that would help."" Australian Lucas Herbert moved from 59th to 42nd with his recent DP World Tour win in Japan while Pablo Larrazabal moved from 101st to 69th thanks to his victory in Korea last week. There are currently only 10 Europeans in the top 50 in the world. Of those, all bar one are PGA Tour regulars and the exception is Belgium's Thomas Pieters, who is 49th and competes on the LIV tour. Rankings are important for player sponsorship deals, especially with manufacturers, with many tied to top-100 status. The world standings are also significant for eligibility into majors. Pelley will tell the committee that the tour has a ""phenomenal"" pathway into The Open and ""great"" access to the US Open.  He is lobbying the Masters and US PGA Championship to try to ensure qualification becomes less ranking dependent and, instead, rewards performances on his tour. There also remains the thorny issue of what to do with the so called 'LIV rebels'.  Eighteen players are liable for punishment after Europe won their arbitration hearing last month. Heavy fines are expected, but there is a belief among tour loyalists that LIV will cover those expenses, leaving those who have gone to the breakaway circuit effectively free of punishment unless they are suspended. ""I will tell you that we are not banning the players,"" Pelley said in his recent podcast appearance. Now he has to convince the players on his tournament committee. It promises to be a long meeting, one likely to be as significant as the Ryder Cup between Europe and the US will prove exciting at the same venue come September.

Volatility,US markets close higher after emergency virus deal,2024-09-25,2020-03-25,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-52030034,"US markets gained again as Donald Trump and the Senate agreed a massive economic relief package worth more than $1.8 trillion (£1.5tn). The package includes money to bail out industries that have been affected by the coronavirus crisis. Republican Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell described it as a ""wartime level of investment"" in the economy. The relief plans lifted financial markets around the world, but investors remained on edge. US markets, which surged on Tuesday in anticipation of the deal, teetered in the final moments of trade on Wednesday, closing below their peak for the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 2.4% higher, while the S&P 500 closed up 1.1%. The Nasdaq dipped 0.45%.  Shares in Boeing surged more than 23%, fuelled in part by expectations that it would benefit from the deal.  Earlier, shares rose in Europe and Asia on news of the relief package. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index closed 8% higher, while London's FTSE 100 index gained more than 4.4%. Full details of the deal agreed in the US will not be published until later on Wednesday. However, it is expected to contain measures to help people pay bills if they are laid off because of the virus, expand unemployment assistance by $250bn and get $350bn in emergency loans to small firms. Mr McConnell said it would also ""stabilise"" key industrial sectors and give money to hospitals and other healthcare providers which were having difficulty getting equipment. ""We're going to pass this legislation later today,"" Mr McConnell added. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer called the package ""the largest rescue package in American history"". He said it was a ""Marshall Plan"" for hospitals. ""Help is on the way, big help and quick help."" Separately, President Trump on Tuesday said he wanted to get the economy up and running again by Easter. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones jumped by 11.4% on Tuesday - its biggest one-day gain since the Great Depression - as political leaders signalled a deal was close. The final package is estimated to amount to about 10% of US output, more than double the relief offered during the 2008 financial crisis. William Foster, a vice president at Moody's Investors Service, said it would ""help mitigate the depth and duration of the economic shock"". ""Nonetheless, we expect the virus to have a significant negative impact on growth and the fiscal deficit this year,"" he said. Governments around the world have responded to a surge in coronavirus cases by locking down societies in the hope of slowing the spread of the virus.  The International Monetary Fund has warned the hit to global growth is likely to be bigger than the financial crisis. Many countries are now working on stimulus packages to support their economies, but these plans have received mixed responses from investors, as markets experience unprecedented volatility as they grapple with the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic. This month alone has seen the Dow having the five biggest daily gains and five biggest falls of its 135-year history. Reacting to news of the stimulus package, Tom Stevenson, investment director at fund manager Fidelity International, said: ""It's good news, but we're not out of the woods yet. ""When markets are falling, you get these big rallies but you shouldn't get stuck on that. They do bounce around in these situations."" The US rescue package follows five days of intense negotiations to try to agree a deal that will provide aid for American workers and businesses. Before it becomes law the deal must get through the Republican-controlled Senate, the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives and be signed by President Trump. The US central bank, the Federal Reserve has already announced $4tn in extra lending to help stimulate the economy in the face of the coronavirus. Nearly 19,000 people have died with coronavirus worldwide since it emerged in China's Wuhan province in January, and more than 420,000 infections have been confirmed. Southern Europe is now at the centre of the pandemic, with Italy and Spain recording hundreds of new deaths every day. The US has confirmed more than 55,000 cases, the third highest of any country after China and Italy. The US Congress has approved a $2tn rescue bill - the biggest package of support for the economy in modern American history. Like the UK's emergency economic measures, it offers $350bn in loans for small businesses to cover expenses for up to 10 weeks; it also offers $500bn in aid to airlines and other corporations. The government is also sending out cheques of $1,200 for every adult and $500 per child. But there's concern that the package, for all its huge size, simply isn't big enough to soften the scale of the economic shock caused by the Covid-19 shutdown, now a global phenomenon. Some economists say US firms may need five times as much cash to prevent mass bankruptcy and unemployment."
Volatility,Steam stops accepting Bitcoin payments,2024-09-25,2017-12-07,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-42264622,"Online game service Steam has stopped accepting payments made with the Bitcoin virtual currency. In a statement, development studio Valve, which runs Steam, said ""high fees and volatility"" had driven it to stop accepting them. It said that fees to process Bitcoin payments had ""skyrocketed"" in 2017, making the virtual currency much less attractive as an option. It said it may re-evaluate Bitcoin as a payment possibility in the future. In its statement, Valve said although Bitcoin had always been volatile, the rapid changes in value it had seen during the past few months had been ""extreme"". Steam started accepting payments in bitcoins in April this year.  At that time, each Bitcoin was worth about $450 (£335). Now, each coin is worth about $14,800. The moment-by-moment shifts in value were a problem, Valve said, because of the narrow window customers had to complete a purchase using bitcoins.  If a Bitcoin-based transaction was prolonged, the value of the coins being transferred could change ""significantly"", it said. In these cases, customers had to transfer more bitcoins to make the payment, or get a refund. And either option would result in the customer paying more exchange fees, currently about $20.  Some customers adding bitcoins had even been caught out a second time as the value changed again. ""This year, we've seen increasing number of customers get into this state,"" Valve said. Bitcoin continued to rise in value this week and looks set to break the $15,000 barrier soon. Valve's decision comes as crypto-cash mining market NiceHash reported a ""security breach"" had meant hackers had accessed its Bitcoin wallet, which had contained about $60m in bitcoins."
Volatility,"'I'm waiting to get £2,000 back from crypto giant'",2024-09-25,2022-11-09,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63577783,"FTX users have described feeling ""hopeful"" after withdrawals on the cryptocurrency exchange have appeared to restart. Thomas Culham, 22, told the BBC that he had lodged a withdrawal request for £2,000. Bitcoin touched a two-year low after the Binance pulled out of a deal to rescue its smaller rival, FTX. The exchange, used to buy and sell digital tokens, is still advising customers not to make deposits. According to Coindesk and reports from users on social media, the troubled platform has allowed some customers to withdraw funds for the first time in days. Thomas, a 22-year-old from Kingston, has been an FTX customer for more than a year, and describes it as a ""hub for crypto"". He says he was able to lodge a withdrawal request for £2,000 he held on the exchange, which he describes as a ""really significant amount of money"". But he says he has concerns around the volume of requests made by FTX customers, and is not sure whether or not they will all be serviced as the company battles on. On Thursday, Bitcoin fell below $16,000 (£14,049) for the first time since 2020. Investor confidence was hit by the news that Binance had scrapped its deal to buy FTX, citing concerns over due diligence. There are also fears of further crypto market volatility if FTX goes bust. Concerns about the company's financial health reportedly triggered $6bn (£5.2bn) of withdrawals in just three days. ""I thought FTX was safe"", another customer told the BBC earlier on Thursday. ""I've got about $3,000 (£2,630) worth of coins in my own crypto wallet but more worrying is that I invested $33,000 (£28,900) for my mum and stepdad through the app. I don't yet have the heart to tell them what's happened."" Binance said reports of ""mishandled customer funds and alleged US agency investigations"" had swayed its decision not to buy FTX.  The Reuters news agency reported that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was investigating FTX's handling of customer funds and its crypto-lending activities. The markets regulator is also examining whether the platform has broken laws with regards to how it has handled customer assets. Binance said in a statement posted on Twitter that the issues facing FTX were ""beyond our control or ability to help"". ""Every time a major player in an industry fails, retail consumers will suffer. We have seen over the last several years that the crypto ecosystem is becoming more resilient and we believe in time that outliers that misuse user funds will be weeded out by the free market."" FTX's founder Sam Bankman-Fried and Binance's chief executive Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao are two of the most powerful people in the cryptocurrency market and high-profile rivals. The pressure on FTX came in part from Mr Zhao, who had tweeted on Sunday that Binance would sell its holdings of FTX's digital token, known as FTT. The token has lost around 90% of its value this week. Binance stepped in on Tuesday, saying it had signed a letter of intent to buy FTX's non-US unit. But it added it had ""the discretion to pull out from the deal at any time"". Mr Zhao tweeted on Wednesday: ""Sad day. Tried, but [crying emoji]"". As well as Bitcoin dropping on the news, shares in the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase fell by more than 9.5%. Meanwhile, venture capital firm Sequoia Capital said it will completely write off its more than $210m investment in FTX, as the cryptocurrency exchange is at risk of bankruptcy. ""Based on our current understanding, we are marking our investment down to $0,"" the company said in a statement posted on Twitter. April Joyner, a correspondent at Business Insider in New York, told the BBC's Today programme the problems at FTX could be quite serious. ""If FTX were to go under a lot of people could potentially lose their money depending on what's going on there,"" she said. A notice on its website still reads: ""FTX is currently unable to process withdrawals. We strongly advise against depositing."" FTX was approached by BBC News for comment. ""It's also led to a lot of turmoil on crypto markets - we've seen prices of Bitcoin, Etherium etc fall and so there's a lot of distress and worries about the crypto markets right now,"" Ms Joyner added. Ms Joyner said the ""different players"" in cryptocurrency firms were ""very enmeshed"" with each other which meant ""if one entity has some sort of weakness it can bring down a lot of other players"". There is a growing list of cryptocurrency businesses that have failed because of a lack of cash reserves. Adding to the pressure, the SEC and other regulators have been ratcheting up scrutiny of the industry as concerns grow about how crypto platforms are trading. Earlier this year, a subsidiary of crypto firm BlockFi agreed to pay a record penalty to settle charges related to its retail lending product."
Volatility,Tesla optimistic despite new record loss,2024-09-25,2018-05-02,By Natalie Sherman,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-43980413,"Tesla said it will be profitable in the second half of 2018 - but only if it can make 5,000 Model 3 cars every week. Reaching that goal is in doubt given the electric car maker produced just 2,270 in the last week of April. Tesla is striving to produce more cars as questions mount about its financial situation. The company posted a record quarterly loss of almost $710m (£523m) for the three months to March - more than double the same period last year. Revenues jumped 26% to $3.4bn, but it continued to burn through cash. Tesla said it would cut capital spending this year to less than $3bn as it focuses on ""near-term needs"".  Elon Musk's firm also told investors that it will deliver more of its expensive luxury models in the second half of the year.  Tesla's manufacturing challenges persist, however. It suspended Model 3 production in mid-April in a planned shutdown and expects a total of 10 days of downtime this quarter.  Elon Musk: Just walk out of bad meetings SpaceX and Tesla alive 'by skin of their teeth' The company is trying to improve its manufacturing process of the Model 3, its newest car aimed at the mass market. ""We made a mistake by adding too much automation too quickly,"" Tesla told investors on Wednesday. Efraim Levy, an analyst at CFRA, said the results were ""mixed"", noting the decline in the firm's available cash. On a call with financial analysts, the strain over the firm's finances was apparent. Mr Musk refused to answer a question about the number of Model 3 reservations, and cut short an exchange about Tesla's spending plans. ""These questions are so dry. They're killing me,"" he said, moving to take questions from a private shareholder and owner of a finance-focused YouTube channel rather than an institutional analyst. Mr Musk also criticised media coverage of accidents involving driverless cars, saying reports gave a misleading impression about the safety of such vehicles. Tesla shares, which had declined slightly at the start of the call, fell about 5% in after-hours trading in New York. Mr Musk said investors should be focused on the long-term and dismissed concerns about rapid stock movements. ""If people are concerned about volatility, they should definitely not buy our stock,"" he said. Despite its heavy losses the company is worth about $51bn - roughly as much as General Motors, America's biggest car maker. Jamie Albertine, an analyst at Consumer Edge, said in a note: ""Steady, a word not often used in describing Tesla, is becoming more of a reality as management continues to chip away at its 5,000 units per week Model 3 production goal."" He estimated the company would hit that target in the second half of 2018. "
Volatility,Tourist pound now close to one dollar,2024-09-25,2018-12-14,By Brian Milligan,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46555314,"Travellers at some UK airports are barely being offered one US dollar for each of their pounds, following a month of Brexit uncertainty. Those exchanging pounds at the UK's biggest airport, Heathrow, are finding as little as $1.05 coming back across the counter. Since 16 April the pound has fallen by 11.77% against the US dollar.  In places, sterling buys less than a euro, with tourists being offered just 92 cents for every pound. Against the dollar, the pound is now at its weakest since April 2017, although it has recovered slightly since Theresa May won her vote of confidence. In March 2008 the pound was briefly worth more than $2.00. While there are some other factors behind the drop in the pound's value, such as the receding chances of an interest rate rise, most experts accept that the politics of Brexit are chiefly to blame. ""Over the last couple of months... we've seen several developments in Brexit negotiations, MP resignations and more recently a leadership challenge which have all sparked significant turbulence for the pound,"" said Ian Strafford-Taylor, the chief executive of currency traders FairFx. Changing money at a port or airport is the most expensive way of doing so, and there are usually much cheaper deals online. The best deal on offer on Friday was $1.23 for one pound. Tourist rates are also more expensive than official exchange rates, as they take into account the costs of providing bureaux de change. But the weakness of the pound leaves anyone thinking of going abroad next year with a dilemma: Should they buy their currency now, or wait, in the hope that the pound will recover? ""It's impossible to predict how foreign exchange rates will change in future, especially with volatility around Brexit and other economic events,"" said Nathan Best, UK commercial director at Travelex.   ""The best customers can do is keep an eye on rates and convert at a rate they feel comfortable with.   One option for customers who are wary of foreign currency volatility is to split their currency purchases to reduce risk. Customers can choose to buy some of their currency before their trip with a preferred rate, and then buy the remaining currency closer to, or during, the trip.""   Top tips to help you get the most from your travel cash Shop around for a rate: There are lots of comparison websites available to find out the best rates, both online and on the high street. Avoid buying cash at the airport: If you need some currency to take with you, Emma Grimster from Travel Supermarket says ""you could end up throwing away money"" if you don't plan ahead - particularly if you get your cash from the airport. Use an overseas travel card: Getting a travel credit card that doesn't charge any transaction fees to get cash out of an overseas cash machine is the cheapest way of getting currency, according to analysis from Money Saving Expert. Use a pre-paid travel card: Many providers allow you to load a card with money before you travel, locking-in an exchange rate. Such cards include FairFX, Revolut and WeSwap. Buy half now and half later: If you think the pound may go up or down significantly before your holiday, Helen Saxon of the website Money Saving Expert says you can always hedge your bets. ""If you've bought half now and the rate goes down i.e. you get less dollars to the pound, then at least you've got half at the higher rate, and similarly if the rate goes up, again you're getting half at the higher rate."" Know your charges: It's not exactly the most exciting bit about going on holiday, but being clued up about the charges involved with withdrawing from an ATM in another country is the best way to avoid any surprise fees.  Consider the cost of living: Attempting to book a holiday, but not feeling super confident with the changing rates? Emma Grimster says you should think carefully about what board you choose when staying at a hotel. For example, all-inclusive may be a better choice - depending on the country you're visiting."
Volatility,Energy bills to rise more than predicted - Ofgem,2024-09-25,2022-07-11,By Kevin Peachey,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-62123691,"Domestic energy bills will rise faster this winter than previously forecast by the energy regulator Ofgem, its chief executive has admitted to MPs. Jonathan Brearley said in late May that a typical household would pay £800 a year more from October.  But, while giving evidence to MPs, he said it was ""clear"" that estimate for winter bills now looked too low. The original figure was used by ministers when deciding how much to pay in direct assistance this winter. One industry analyst has predicted a rise of more than £1,200 a year in October. Cornwall Insight said that the typical domestic customer was likely to pay £3,244 a year from October, then £3,363 a year from January.  The typical bill at present is about £2,000 a year. In itself, this was a rise of £700 a year in April, compared with the previous six months. About 23 million households in England, Wales and Scotland have their bills governed by the energy price cap. That limits the amount suppliers can charge per unit of energy, and the standing charge, and is set every six months. From this winter, it is expected that this will change to a three-month period. Mr Brearley said in May that a typical household gas and electricity bill on the price cap would increase to £2,800 a year, owing to continued volatility in gas prices. But on Monday, he told MPs on the Public Accounts Committee that it was ""clear"", given the current ""pricing dynamics"" and the ongoing war in Ukraine, that ""prices are looking higher than they did when we made that estimate"". However, he would not be drawn on exactly how much higher bills would be, ahead of the official announcement in the coming weeks. Starting later this week, direct payments will be made to low-income households to help with the cost of living and covering energy bills. Sarah Munby, permanent secretary at the Department for Business, said ministers would ""keep a close eye"" on whether this policy should go further if bills rose higher than expected. Ofgem also told MPs that it had found issues with direct debit demands from suppliers, during a review following accusations that companies increased customers' direct debit payments by ""more than is necessary"". More details will be announced in the coming days. Soaring wholesale prices meant around 30 suppliers have collapsed during the crisis that has hit the sector. A total of 26 remain in the market. About 2.4 million customers were automatically moved to a rival company when their own supplier folded. Typically, according to Citizens Advice, they had to pay an extra £30 a month for the duration of their original contract, as they were shifted to a more expensive tariff. In addition, the cost of these failures totalled £2.7bn - a tab which was spread across all billpayers in Britain at a cost of about £94 each, not just those of the failed companies. This is before taking into account the potentially multi-billion charge that households could face due to the collapse of Bulb Energy, which is in special administration. Last month, it was announced that Hayden Wood, who was the company's boss and co-founder, would leave at the end of July. In June, the National Audit Office (NAO) said Ofgem had allowed an energy market to develop that was vulnerable to large shocks. The NAO said that Ofgem had decided on a ""low bar"" approach for allowing new domestic energy suppliers into the market to encourage competition and choice for customers after the market had been dominated by six big companies.

Volatility,E.On boss: Remove green levies to cut energy bills,2024-09-25,2021-09-16,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-58579829,"The UK government should cut rising energy bills by getting rid of levies that subsidise renewable energy, the boss of E.On UK has said. Speaking to the Financial Times, Michael Lewis said green subsidies should be funded through tax instead. Regulators have warned that consumer energy bills will be hit by soaring prices of fossil fuels globally. Wholesale energy prices rose on Thursday after a key electricity cable between Britain and France shut down. Mr Lewis said: ""This is going to be a very challenging winter for customers and for suppliers and there is a real short-term imperative to do what we can to help consumers."" Green levies account for around a quarter of energy bills, he said. Mr Lewis recommended removing green levies and paying for subsidies through general taxation, ""so these costs are funded more progressively and we level the playing field on the cost of cleaner heating."" ""Then we can also start to apply something like a carbon tax on gas on a 'polluter pays' principle,"" he added. A government spokesperson said: ""Our energy price cap will protect millions of customers this winter from sudden increases in global gas prices. ""Millions of low-income households will also benefit from a £140 discount on their bills, with added support offered to pensioners and the most vulnerable over the colder months."" A jump in prices after a UK electricity interconnector was taken offline after a fire has been fuelling concerns about inflation and the potential impact on businesses just as the country's economy starts to recover from the worst effects of the coronavirus pandemic. National Grid said the fire and planned maintenance at a site near Ashford in Kent meant the cable will be totally offline until 25 September. Half of its capacity, or one gigawatt (GW) of power, is expected to remain unavailable until late March 2022. On Wednesday, British electricity prices for the following day jumped by 19% to £475 per megawatt hour (MWh). The energy regulator told the BBC that increasing prices, for gas in particular, ""will feed into all customer energy bills in the UK"". The price cap, which limits the price firms can charge customers who have not recently changed their energy tariff, will increase in October in order to cover rising wholesale costs. The fire at the Interconnexion France-Angleterre (IFA) site broke out in the early hours of Wednesday. The site was evacuated and there were no reports of casualties. After the fire an electricity interconnector running under the English Channel was ""not operating"", the National Grid said in a statement. Electricity interconnectors are high-voltage cables that connect the electricity systems of neighbouring countries, and allow them to share excess power. A spokesperson for National Grid's electricity system operator, which balances power supplies in the UK, said it expects to ""continue supplying electricity safely and securely"" despite the incident. The link can carry up to 2GW of power, and had been importing electricity from France in recent days, after UK prices hit a record high of £540 per MWh on the wholesale energy market. Analysts are now closely watching National Grid's efforts to get the facility fully back online as winter approaches and with it higher energy demand. Glenn Rickson, head of European power analysis at S&P Global Platts Analytics, told Reuters: ""The outage is going to lift the potential for price volatility as long as it's offline... and of course demand will get higher as we move further into winter."" UK Steel director general Gareth Stace pointed out that the ""extortionate"" electricity prices had already forced some steelmakers to suspend operations. ""Even with the global steel market as buoyant as it is, these eye-watering prices are making it impossible to profitably make steel at certain times of the day and night,"" he said. Other analysts have suggested that as a result, the UK may have to rely more heavily on gas-fired power stations in the coming months.  Wholesale gas prices are already elevated for several reasons, such as low winds meaning less renewable energy is generated, outages at some nuclear stations and lower flows into the UK of the gas from Norway. On Wednesday, fertilizer producer CF Industries Holdings said it was suspending operations at both its Billingham and Ince manufacturing complexes due to high gas costs. National Grid said its investigation into the fire at the IFA site was continuing and it would ""update the market with any changes as necessary"". Britain is a net importer of electricity and near neighbour France is its biggest supplier of power through the interconnectors that run under the English Channel.

Volatility,The US city mayors banking on cryptocurrency,2024-09-25,2021-12-14,By Lucy Hooker,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-59522532,"Miami already has a lot going for it - the sunshine, the beach, the Cuban coffee. Now the city's mayor Francis Suarez wants to put it on the map for another reason: he wants to be the first to create a new way of raising money for the city - through a new cryptocurrency. MiamiCoin, an experiment he launched this year, could bring in so much revenue that there could be a future scenario where ""Miamians would no longer need to pay municipal taxes,"" the Republican told the BBC. That is one aspiration, and beyond that, he hopes one day to be able to hand out MiamiCoin to every resident, as a kind of digital dividend. MiamiCoin is just one part of Mr Suarez's drive to establish Miami as a centre for cryptocurrency. ""I believe we've been presented a very unique opportunity to diversify our economy,"" he said. ""Prior to the pandemic over 60% of Miami's economy was service sector-based. That left us particularly vulnerable to Covid and I won't pass on the chance to change that."" But while Mr Suarez is first out of the blocks, he's not the only mayor in the race for crypto-capital of the US.  Hot on his heels is the man about to take over next month as New York mayor, Eric Adams. Cryptocurrencies, depending who you ask, are either about to revolutionise the global economy, circumventing national governments' hold on finance, and putting power in the hands of ordinary citizens, or they are risky and unstable tools, that enable illegal activities, from ransomware to drug dealing. A cryptocurrency is a digital product, created without the backing of any central bank or payment system, created or ""mined"" by computers running complex software programmes. Anyone willing to invest the time and money to set up the necessary computing equipment can mine, or even establish their own cryptocurrency. They can also be bought and sold, like investing in a commodity. The best known cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, has attracted enormous attention, has been very volatile, and fortunes have been lost and made investing in it. But many other cryptocurrencies have now been established in its wake. Watch: What are cryptocurrencies? Mr Adams, a Democrat, who takes office in January, has promised to make New York a crypto-hub. He has talked about city employees getting paid in cryptocurrency and wants lessons on cryptocurrency in New York schools.  Once he'd heard that Mr Suarez had asked to get his first paycheque in Bitcoin, the New Yorker requested the same for his own first three months' pay. Mr Adams is backing his city's version of a cryptocurrency, NYCCoin. While some of the rivalry may simply be about sending out signals, both mayors are serious about establishing their city as a hub for cryptocurrency business. In June, Mr Suarez hosted a Bitcoin conference in Miami that attracted around 12,000 enthusiasts including bankers, tech executives and crypto-entrepreneurs. The next one is already planned for April 2022. And embracing the idea of a city-based crypto-token, like MiamiCoin or NYCCoin, is another way to illustrate commitment to the sector.  Anyone can mine MiamiCoin. When doing so, some of the proceeds of the mining go straight to the miner. The rest goes to a nonprofit initative that underpins the city tokens called CityCoins.  CityCoins, via an automated system, relays 30% of the MiamiCoin generated to the City of Miami and 70% is distributed around to all the holders of MiamiCoin. MiamiCoin, which launched in August, has generated over $20m on behalf of the city, with around 3,500 people taking part in the mining process, according to CityCoins. It's important to note, that MiamiCoin itself is not money, despite the name, cautions Dara Tarkowski, a financial lawyer at Actuate Law in Miami and Chicago. ""It functions much more like a security that needs to be traded and then cashed out at some point."" ""Its inherent value is purely based on supply and demand,"" said Ms Tarkowski. ""The tokens only have value at the time they're cashed out, and just like a stock we never know what that is going to look like"". None of the MiamiCoin already created has been translated into spending money for the city yet, although Mr Suarez says they are the process now of converting some it into dollars. ""We should be expecting $5m sometime in December,"" he said. Meanwhile cryptocurrency miners have already generated more than $25m in NYCCoin for New York's digital wallet. For now, other cities are watching to see how this experiment in digital fund-raising pans out. And opinion is divided. Besides their volatility, cryptocurrencies come with plenty of other risks. They have long history of association with criminal activity from ransomware to drugs and there have been numerous cryptocurrency scams. Regulators are still trying to catch up with what rules to impose on what is still a nascent investment sector.  John Reed Stark, cybersecurity consultant with long years of experience at America's top financial regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), as well as in academia, thinks the crypto-mayors could be riding for a fall. ""Ultimately whatever they do with crypto is going to crash and burn and is going to be a disaster,"" he predicted. He views cryptocurrencies as essentially an elaborate Ponzi scheme, ""the ultimate hustle"", based on its advocates ramping up interest in a succession of new hyped up projects. ""What they'll realise soon is, the emperor has no clothes. A bank regulator or federal regulator will come along and hopefully intervene and say you cannot do this, you are facilitating criminal enterprises, and you are peddling products that have no intrinsic value,"" he said. The SEC is looking closely at cryptocurrency activities and there's good reason for that, said Mr Reed. In his view accepting cryptocurrency is ""akin to trading in blood diamonds"". Across the political spectrum politicians have called for stricter regulation, from Elizabeth Warren, the Democratic senator to Donald Trump, the Republican former president. Mr Suarez said he recognised the risks, but said his administration ""exhausted all avenues of due diligence"". And other outsiders are praising the mayors' readiness to innovate. ""Lots of municipalities make all sorts of investments, in a variety of different assets. Some of them invest millions of dollars in real estate, others in bonds,"" said Ms Tarkowski. ""To me this is just another interesting investment vehicle and frankly quite creative for a municipality to do"". The view of cryptocurrencies as something shadowy and criminal is outdated now that so many people are investing in the sector, she argued. City mayors would be ""foolish"" not to look at any new sources of income, if it could help supplement their funds, Ms Tarkowski said. ""I would applaud Mr Suarez for some ingenuity and creativity and trying something new,"" she said."
Volatility,Bank will not hesitate to raise interest rates,2024-09-25,2022-09-26,By Michael Race,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63039687,"The Bank of England has said it will ""not hesitate"" to hike interest rates to curb inflation after the pound fell to a record low against the US dollar. The Bank said it was ""monitoring developments closely"" and would make a decision on any action in November. Its statement came after the Treasury said it would publish a plan to tackle debt in a bid to reassure investors. In Asia currency market trade on Tuesday, the pound rose by more than 1% to top $1.08. On Monday, some UK lenders said that they were halting new mortgage deals. Halifax, the UK's largest mortgage lender, said it would temporarily withdraw all mortgage products that come with a fee due to the market volatility. Virgin Money and Skipton Building Society have also stopped offering mortgage products to new customers.  Experts said a rise in the cost of long-term borrowing due to the market turmoil meant the cost to lenders of offering new mortgage deals was too expensive. Sterling fell to an all-time low earlier against the US dollar after Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng pledged further tax cuts at the weekend on top of Friday's mini-budget where he announced the biggest tax cuts in 50 years. The pound had been sliding as global markets reacted to the sharp increase in government borrowing required to fund the cuts. A weak pound makes it more expensive to buy imported goods and risks pushing up the rising cost of living even further. Imports of commodities priced in dollars, including oil and gas, are also more expensive.  UK inflation, the rate at which prices rise, is already rising at its fastest rate for 40 years. Some economists had predicted the Bank of England would call an emergency meeting in the coming days to raise interest rates in a bid to stem the fall, as well as calming rising prices. But the Bank of England instead said it was ""monitoring developments in financial markets very closely"" and would make a full assessment at its next meeting on 3 November. Investors are now predicting that interest rates could more than double by next spring to 5.8% from their current 2.25%, to curb high inflation, which is expected to be fuelled by the huge tax cuts announced in Friday's mini-budget. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said if interest rates rise as predicted, the average household refinancing a two-year fixed rate mortgage in the first half of next year would see monthly payments jump to £1,490 from £863.  ""Many simply won't be able to afford this,"" he said.  A late afternoon double dose of attempted reassurance - firstly from the Treasury, and then from the Bank of England. What's new from the Treasury is a timeline with dates attached. There will be a series of statements from various cabinet ministers about ideas we heard about on Friday. And then in just under two months, a parliamentary moment. What's being described as the ""Medium Term Fiscal Plan"" - and the Office for Budget Responsibility's number crunching. In short, what the Treasury is attempting to say is this: don't panic, we know what we're doing. Well, let's see what the markets do next. The market volatility following Mr Kwarteng's mini-budget has also been linked in part to the government's decision not to publish a forecast of expected UK growth and government borrowing from independent forecaster the Office for Budget Responsibility. Martin Weale, Professor of Economics at King's College London and former member of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee, which votes on interest rates, told BBC Radio 4's PM programme that people ""are concerned that the government has no plan for bringing the national debt under control."" ""Sterling has fallen because market traders have been frightened by the government's policies, and I think they got further frightened by the sense over the weekend that this was only the first instalment of some tax cuts."" But Lord David Frost, Conservative peer and former chief Brexit negotiator, said the reaction on global markets was ""an overreaction"". ""I don't think anything has gone wrong, actually, Liz Truss promised change, a different economic approach to get us back to growth and away from stagnation."" He said as part of this change in approach, interest rates would rise and the government would need to provide additional support via tax cuts and whilst it would need to reduce spending medium term, the details of that would come in November. The government said its financial plan set for 23 November would include full growth and borrowing forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility. It also pledged to set out further details on the government's spending rules, including how it will try to decrease debt. Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said given the pound had fallen back since the statements from the Bank and the Treasury the markets ""may well need more reassurance and some actual action"", saying a change in policy from government or an interest rate hike from the Bank at an emergency meeting before 3 November may be necessary."
Volatility,Sturgeon says UK economic crisis worst in memory,2024-09-25,2022-09-28,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-63063914,"Scotland's first minister has warned that the UK could be facing a worse economic crisis than the 2008 global financial crash.  Nicola Sturgeon described the fallout from tax cuts announced by the Chancellor last week as ""extraordinary and unprecedented"". Ms Sturgeon called for the UK government to reverse its income tax cuts for the highest earners. She said the move would be a sign of ""some kind of sense being restored"". The first minister was speaking as the Bank of England warned of a ""material risk to UK financial stability"" if the volatility continued. It said it would start buying government bonds at an ""urgent pace"" to help restore ""orderly market conditions"". The pound slumped in value by 1.6% against the dollar to $1.05 on Wednesday morning, while lenders withdrew about a quarter of mortgage products overnight as they grappled with the prospect of further rises in interest rates. And the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has rebuked the government's £45bn tax-cutting plans as being ""risky"" and likely to increase inequality.  Ms Sturgeon told a committee of senior MSPs at Holyrood that the Bank of England's intervention was  ""extraordinary"" and showed that the UK was in the ""grip of a rapidly deteriorating economic crisis"". And she said the mini-budget unveiled by Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng last Friday had sparked the most serious situation for the UK economy in memory, possibly even including the 2008 global financial crisis which led to governments having to bail-out banks and other financial institutions. The first minister called for immediate action to be taken, and for MPs to return early to the Parliament from recess.  And she said that ""as an immediate symbol of some kind of good sense being restored, the decision to abolish the top rate of tax should be reversed"". Ms Sturgeon added: ""I don't think it is possible to overstate the damage of this budget.""  Mr Kwarteng announced in last week's mini-budget that the basic rate of income tax will be cut from 20% to 19% from April of next year. He also pledged to abolish the 45% additional rate of tax, which is paid by people who earn more than £150,000 a year - a tax saving of nearly £3,000 a year for somebody with an annual income of £200,000. The chancellor insisted he was ""confident"" his tax-cutting strategy - which formed a key part of the campaign pitch by Prime Minister Liz Truss during the Conservative leadership election - would deliver the promised economic growth. The changes do not apply in Scotland, where income tax rates and bands are decided by the Scottish government.  It means the 40% higher rate, for earnings of over £50,270, will be the top rate elsewhere in the UK. But in Scotland everyone earning between £43,663 and £150,000 currently pays 41%, with those earning more than £150,000 paying 46%. Former Conservative MSP Prof Adam Tomkins described the UK government tax plans as being ""profoundly unconservative"" and proof that the UK ""needs a Labour government"". In a column for the Herald newspaper, Prof Tomkins - who left Holyrood last year - accused the Conservatives of ""trashing the economy"" and said it was clear that their time in power ""is up"". Meanwhile his former Scottish Conservative colleague, Graham Simpson MSP, told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme that he was unaware of the International Monetary Fund's concerns about the mini-budget, which were released on Tuesday and featured prominently across the media. When he was asked about the IMF intervention on Wednesday morning, Mr Graham responded: ""That's the first I've heard of it so you're springing that one on me"", before going on to say he thought the Chancellor was doing a good job.  The Scottish government will set out its taxation plans in the coming weeks - but Ms Sturgeon has already indicated that she will not follow the chancellor in cutting rates for the highest earners.  The Treasury has said its plans - which were to be funded by £72bn of borrowing and include scrapping the limit on bonuses for bankers - were focused on growing the economy, which it said would ""raise living standards for everyone"". But Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, who has pledged to reverse the income tax cuts for the wealthiest, said the government had ""completely lost control of the economy""."
Volatility,Business confidence rises: Lloyds survey,2024-09-25,2017-06-25,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-40400214,"Business confidence has jumped to an 18-month high, but companies are having trouble recruiting skilled workers, according to a survey. The Lloyds Bank Business in Britain report's confidence index rose to 24% - double the level immediately following the EU referendum last year. The index is a measure of expected sales, orders and profits. A separate survey by the British Chambers of Commerce forecast weak economic growth for the next few years. The Lloyds Bank report surveyed the views of 1,500 UK companies in May, after the general election was called. The average for the confidence index in the 25 years the report has been compiled is 23%. The net balance of companies that said they had found it difficult to find skilled labour in the past six months hit a 10-year high of 52%.  That was up from 31% in January when the last report was released. The share of firms facing similar issues with unskilled workers also rose to 26%, up from 14%. Tim Hinton of Lloyds Banking Group said: ""Although challenges remain in recruiting both skilled and unskilled labour, businesses are anticipating higher sales, increased profits and staffing levels to rise.  ""However, the outlook remains mixed at best."" According to the survey, four out of six business sectors reported higher levels of confidence since January.  That was attributed mainly to increased demand from UK customers, which Lloyds said suggested was due to factors other than the help that weaker sterling had given to exporters. Hann-Ju Ho, senior economist at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, said: ""Although the pound's value is seen as nearer 'fair value', currency volatility remains a big concern for some UK businesses that trade internationally."" Meanwhile, the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) says that economic growth will remain anaemic over the next few years. The business group, which represents thousands of small and medium-sized companies, says annual GDP growth will not exceed 1.5% by 2020 and inflation could end up being higher than expected. The BCC expects inflation to average 2.9% this year and peak at 3.4% in the last three months of 2017, which it says will hit consumer spending. The group raised its forecast for economic growth from 1.4% to 1.5% for this year, but expected GDP to increase by just 1.3% next year. Adam Marshall, director-general of the BCC, said: ""Over recent months, many of the businesses I speak to have expressed cautious optimism for their own prospects, but remain wary about the growth prospects of the UK economy as a whole.  ""In the wake of an inconclusive general election, that wariness is set to increase."" The group has urged the government to spend more on infrastructure, particularly broadband and mobile phone connectivity, while it has described the UK's road network as sclerotic. In May the Office for National Statistics said the economy expanded by 0.2% in the first three months of the year, down from its first estimate of 0.3%, as the key services sector lost momentum."
Volatility,Campaign 2017: The last (blog) post,2024-09-25,2017-06-07,By David Cornock,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-40173537,"It has been an election campaign like no other, with more than the usual twists and turns amid the slogans in the weeks before polling day. The volatility of the opinion polls has reflected the ups and downs of an extraordinary campaign. I've spent most of the campaign covering the ""air war"" from Westminster. The two main candidates for prime minister have each confounded expectations. Theresa May started the campaign looking invincible but later struggled to communicate her message and ended up re-writing her manifesto within days of its publication. Jeremy Corbyn began the campaign as a leader whose own MPs doubted his ability to do the job and ended looking as if he was really enjoying it. We'll find out on Friday whether any of this matters. Jeremy Corbyn's ability to attract a crowd and energise the left is not in doubt; his ability to win over voters from other parties is less proven.  It was, for the Conservative leader, the most important general election in her lifetime. That didn't stop the leader of the Welsh Conservatives Andrew RT Davies going on holiday halfway through the campaign. I suspect we haven't heard the last of that, fuelled by internal disquiet over the admission of Mark Reckless to the Tory group in the Welsh Assembly.  Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron didn't visit the only seat his party is defending in Wales - Ceredigion. The Lib Dems said this was because he was targeting possible gains (it's possible a Ceredigion visit had been scheduled for the days when campaigning was suspended).  Mr Farron went to Montgomeryshire on Tuesday to warn that the Conservatives' so-called ""dementia tax"" would threaten the future of the family farm.  Just one problem - social care is devolved, as the Lib Dems know, but they were not alone in trying to confuse voters over devolved issues in this campaign. Theresa May came to Wrexham to re-shape her social care policy in England.  Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood was everywhere, although she decided against standing in this election. Whether it was the election debates, the Andrew Marr Show, the Daily Politics, Peston on Sunday, Victoria Derbyshire, Jeremy Vine, The World At One, Today or Woman's Hour, she has a bigger UK-wide profile than any other Welsh politician, one that must be the envy of her predecessors and possibly her parliamentary leader Hywel Williams, who is standing in this election but has been rather less visible. Mind you, it didn't stop UKIP leader Paul Nuttall calling her Natalie. We'll find out on Friday whether that Leanne Wood profile translates into votes. What did we learn from the televised election debates? The biggest headlines were caused by Theresa May's absence. As someone who watches politicians debating with each other for his living, I thought the formats that worked best for viewers were those where a leader was put on the spot by voters rather than exchanged soundbites with their counterparts. My rule of thumb would be this: the more politicians involved in debates, the less illuminating the exchanges. The main manifestos were curious. According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, Labour's sums don't add up. The Conservatives didn't include any sums to add up. There were detailed Tory pledges in some policy areas, vague ones in others - and some issues went unaddressed. There are a few known unknowns: will the Conservatives protect tax relief on pension contributions? Most of it goes to higher-paid workers and it costs £35bn a year.  Are the Conservatives still committed to cutting the numbers of MPs from 650 to 600 (in Wales from 40 to 29)? If it's in their manifesto, I missed it. There is the question of priorities. Labour are promising an ""alternative Wales Bill"" to rewrite (again) the devolution settlement. I get no sense of timing from the manifesto. I suspect that, whoever wins, Parliament will be so busy with Brexit that other legislative demands have to form an orderly queue. Some of the campaign tactics were more effective than others. Do voters care about Jeremy Corbyn's past relationship with the IRA? One Conservative candidate told me that tactic worked well with ""the UKIP demographic"", and there are a lot of UKIP votes to harvest.  The campaign was suspended twice in response to terror attacks, which changed the focus of the subsequent arguments.  It was unusual in many ways. Bill Clinton's team used to say it was ""the economy, stupid"" that decided elections but the economy was far from centre stage this time. Debt and the deficit that featured so strongly two years ago barely got a look in. And then there was Brexit, the reason Theresa May gave for calling this unscheduled election. On the last day of campaigning she reverted to her core campaign theme: who do you trust to get the best Brexit deal? But we may be little the wiser about what that deal looks like - or how it could be secured - until negotiations begin. Whoever wins on Thursday, there are 27 other countries who want to have a say."
Volatility,Wall Street plunges on growth concerns,2024-09-25,2018-12-04,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46445913,"Wall Street shares tumbled on Tuesday, sending all three major indexes down more than 3% in some of the steepest declines in weeks. The Dow Jones index shed almost 800 points, or 3.1%, to close at 25,027.07.  The S&P 500 ended at 2,700.07, down more than 90 points or 3.24%, while the Nasdaq dropped more than 283 points or 3.8% to 7,158.43. The falls came as a closely-watched financial measure caused alarm about US economic prospects. Increasing doubts that talks between the US and China would defuse trade tensions also fuelled the losses, reversing Monday's rise, which followed optimism about those prospects. The declines extended a period of market turbulence that started in October, after the indexes hit record highs earlier in the summer. The losses touched nearly every sector, with the financial industry suffering the biggest declines.  Analysts said the trigger for Tuesday's falls appeared to be concerns about the ""yield curve"", which measures the difference between the interest rates paid on short-term and long-term US bonds. The gap has narrowed in recent months, as investors demand higher rates of return on short-term debt in anticipation of inflation and rate rises.  At the same time, they are accepting relatively lower rates on long-term debt, in anticipation of limited inflation and slower economic growth over the next decade. The difference between the rates on three-year and five-year debt disappeared on Monday. The move fuelled concerns on Tuesday that the same might happen to the gap between two-year and 10-year bonds - a more significant indicator. Historically, when short-term rates rise above longer rates, it signals a recession may be on the horizon. Analysts at S&P Global Ratings said they expected US economic growth to slow, not necessarily contract, in coming months, as a boost from recent tax cuts and increased government spending fades. However, the firm added that the risk of recession had grown, reflecting ""increased volatility"" in financial markets. On Tuesday, shares in financial companies, which are especially exposed to interest rates, were hardest hit. Firms such as JP Morgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, American Express were among the biggest losers on the Dow, all down by more than 3%. Companies at risk in the trade battle, including Apple and aerospace giant Boeing, also suffered steep declines, amid scepticism that the US and China would retreat from their tariff war. ""It was good while it lasted,"" said Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, referring to Monday's rally. Tweets by US President Donald Trump fed the doubts, as he sent conflicting signals in a series of Twitter posts. ""President Xi and I want this deal to happen, and it probably will. But if not remember... I am a Tariff Man,"" he wrote."
Volatility,Warning no room for tax cuts or spending rises,2024-09-25,2023-10-17,By Faisal Islam,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-67118263,"There is ""no room"" for tax cuts or spending increases before an election, an influential think tank has warned. In its annual health check of UK tax, spend and borrowing, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) says the country is ""in a horrible fiscal bind"". It warns ""ill-timed"" pre-election tax cuts could prove ""unsustainable"". The warning comes as the tax burden rises significantly, with 4.5 million more people dragged into higher income tax thresholds by 2028, the IFS says. The IFS calculates that the tax revenue raised by the prime minister's decision to freeze tax thresholds for six years is effectively a tax rise worth £52bn a year by 2028. The very high rates of inflation since the policy was announced have pushed up the original forecast of £8bn a year for revenue raised in 2026. The institute warns that pre-election tax cuts could prove ""unsustainable"" and ""ultimately mean a protracted recession"" as interest rates are forced even higher. The next general election must be held by January 2025. ""With taxes at record levels, and government revenues forecast to exceed non-interest spending for the first time in a generation, you might expect plenty of room for either tax cuts or spending increases. ""But poor growth and very high spending on debt interest over the next few years mean that the national debt is stuck at close to 100% of national income, even with tight spending settlements and further big tax rises in the pipeline,"" he adds, warning of ""a protracted period of high taxes and tight spending,"" says Paul Johnson, IFS director. A rise in the cost of government borrowing, because of higher interest rates than forecast at the Budget, is likely to significantly increase overall levels of borrowing, the IFS says. The economy is also forecast to grow slowly or even endure a shallow recession next year, according to the Green Budget. All of this occurs against a backdrop of significant long-term pressures on public finances, from spending on social care to the NHS. The IFS estimate that the government's recently announced NHS workforce plan could, by itself, cost £50bn a year long term. The official forecasts used by the government are to be released next month alongside the Autumn Statement. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt told the BBC that the UK had to be ""prudent with the public finances"" and ""prepared for volatility and shocks"". He said instability from Russia's invasion of Ukraine was ""proving much more protracted than people hoped"" and that ""we have to be honest with people that this is going to take some time"". But he faces pressure from within his own party and from the opposition. The former PM Liz Truss is planning to release what her allies call a ""Growth Budget"" ahead of his Autumn Statement. Labour believes that the economy needs more investment, and plan to spend £20bn more by the end of the next Parliament, if they win the next election. "
Volatility,Lampard 'absolutely' does not fear Everton sacking,2024-09-25,2023-01-21,BBC Sport,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/64359546,"This video can not be played Watch: Lampard's last interview as Everton manager Everton manager Frank Lampard says he ""absolutely"" does not fear being sacked after his side were beaten by West Ham in the Premier League. The Toffees are without a win in the top flight since October and are stuck in a relegation battle in 19th place. Everton's poor form, consisting of six defeats and two draws, is Lampard's longest winless run as a manager in league competition. ""I don't get that far down the line to fear,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live. When asked by Sky Sports if it was time Lampard was sacked, Everton owner Farhad Moshiri - who was at London Stadium to watch his team in action for the first time in 14 months - replied: ""I can't comment. It's not my decision."" During Everton's poor run of league form over the past three months, the club has also been knocked out of both the Carabao Cup and the FA Cup at the third-round stage.  Jarrod Bowen scored two goals in the first half to hand former Toffees boss David Moyes a much-needed win and heap more misery on under-fire Lampard. The Blues manager added: ""I absolutely don't fear [being sacked], I'm proud to do the job.  ""I just do my job. I get up every day and think how we can get a bit better -  it's as simple as that."" Lampard conceded after the defeat the club are in ""tough times"" and said he knew the task at Goodison Park would be considerable when he took over a year ago because the team were already struggling.   Everton's last victory in all competitions was a 3-0 Premier League win against Crystal Palace in October ""We had a big fight and stayed in the league [last season],"" he told Match of the Day. ""We lost Richarlison and now have tried to build around that, so it is normal we are fighting again when other clubs are trying to move on. ""History moves on and nothing gives you the right to be in their league. If you don't move you will hit tough times. We are in tough times and everyone has to try to move forward. ""It is impossible for me to jump into the future. Last season we were five points shy of safety with five or six games to go, but as a club we have to move together.  ""I cannot complain about the spirit of the players and how they approached the game. They may have passed it slow but we didn't find it in the final third."" Match of the Day pundit Jermaine Jenas, the former Tottenham and England midfielder, said: ""I feel a bit sorry for him [Lampard]. He's probably conflicted as to whether he sits tight and tries to keep clean sheets, because he's got no goalscorer in the team - so what chance has he got?"" Asked about Moshiri's comments on Lampard's future, Jenas added: ""If he [Moshiri] isn't making the decisions, then who is? He's definitely passing the buck.  ""He obviously felt that his presence at the game was going to have some form of impact. I think it sums up the disconnect of the club and what is actually happening there and why there is so much upheaval and frustration within the fanbase.""

Everton owner Farhad Moshiri, who last attended a game at Goodison Park in October 2021, was present to watch the 2-0 loss at fellow strugglers West Ham that will surely end Lampard's reign after less than a year in charge.  It certainly looked and sounded ominous when Moshiri refused to back Lampard as he was 'doorstepped' at London Stadium, although suggesting it was not his decision was at odds with the usual impression given - that the billionaire's volatility and impatience is behind so many bad moves, including five managerial sackings, that have put Everton in this parlous plight.  Lampard's class as a personality - and his willingness to engage with an increasingly angry fanbase - means his leaving would not be celebrated by fans. But results have simply been not good enough after last season's late escape from relegation.  Everton's board were at least in attendance at West Ham, having stayed away from the last home game against Southampton at Goodison Park on security advice - which meant they saw in person just how discontented supporters are, with more protests and banners demanding their removal.  This may happen eventually - but the person who currently looks in most danger of removal is Lampard.  McNulty match preview: Dysfunction & mistrust in Everton's latest crisis The large away support brought banners voicing their anger at the Everton board and the decline of the club in recent seasons. The protests were witnessed in person this time by Moshiri, along with chairman Bill Kenwright, chief executive Denise Barrett-Baxendale, football director Kevin Thelwell and director Graeme Sharp after the board members were advised to miss last week's home defeat by Southampton because of  safety concerns.  Unfortunately for Lampard, so was the disappointing result.  Everton fans again made their feelings known towards the board with banners at London Stadium He was given a small morale boost before the game, however, when a group of fans offered him encouraging words and reiterated that their disapproval is mainly directed at the club's hierarchy.  ""It's not about you - that's why all the boys are here to support the team,"" one supporter tells Lampard as he shakes his hand in the video that was shared on social media.  ""We are all behind you. I know you're under a bit of pressure but we are 100% behind you and we're all here today.""

Volatility,How is UK election affecting Asian business?,2024-09-25,2017-06-09,By Leisha Chi,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-40211161,"Uncertainty hangs over the UK after Prime Minister Theresa May's decision to call a snap general election backfired, resulting in a hung parliament.  The pound has dropped by more than 2% against the dollar, sterling's biggest one-day fall since the Brexit referendum vote last June. So far there has not been much in the way of global contagion in the currency or stock markets.  But in Asia, where shares were trading as results drifted in, some companies heavily exposed to the UK saw their share prices fall.  Asian firms with big investments in Britain were under pressure over concerns political uncertainty will complicate Brexit negotiations. They include infrastructure firm CKI, Power Assets and CK Hutchison, which are all owned by Chinese billionaire Li Ka-Shing. Shares in those businesses are down nearly 2%.  Malaysian property conglomerate YTL, Singapore-based transport firm Comfortdelgro and property firm City Developments also have investments in Britain.  ""Without question, there is volatility ahead. The market is desperate for any indication of what a Brexit deal might look like,"" Lee Hardman, an analyst at MUFG said. For financial firms in the UK, one looming question about Brexit is whether they would have to move their operations if they lost access to the single market - an issue over so-called European passporting rights.  Shares in British lenders Standard Chartered Bank and HSBC slipped by about 1% on Asian markets as the prospect of a hung parliament became clearer.  Fund manager Janus Henderson, which is also heavily exposed to the UK market for revenues, fell by about 1.5% in Sydney trading. The Australia-listed CYBG, which owns the Clydesdale and Yorkshire banks, fell as much as 1.4% before recovering. The firm, which was spun from National Australia Bank last year, gets all of its revenues from the UK. Overall Asian stock markets have largely shrugged off the election upset - as well as digesting possible implications from former FBI director James Comey's testimony to a US Senate committee. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 stock index closed 0.5% higher and South Korea's Kospi cended the day up 0.8%. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 was flat, the Shanghai composite end 0.1% higher and Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 0.3%, Follow Leisha on Twitter."
Volatility,Brexit fund for beef farmers announced,2024-09-25,2019-07-29,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-49152263,"Irish beef farmers who are facing ""market volatility and uncertainty"" because of Brexit are to be given access to a €100m fund.  The Irish Minister for Agriculture said the Beef Exceptional Aid Measure will be funded by the government and the EU.  Michael Creed said it he was ""keenly aware that the last number of months have been very difficult for beef farmers"". He said the scheme aims to provide financial aid to farmers most affected. Mr Creed added: ""There has been a prolonged and exceptional period of depressed prices since last autumn, with the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the outcome of Brexit, among other factors, contributing to this market disturbance."" He said this fund, combined with the Beef Environmental Efficiency Pilot introduced earlier this year, provides ""an injection of up to €120m"" to the sector. Farmers must meet certain eligibility criteria to qualify.  Eligible farmers are to get €100 per animal slaughtered between 24 September 2018 and 12 May 2019, covering up to a maximum of 100 animals per herd. A payment of €40 will also be made on suckler cows that calved in 2018, up to a maximum of 40 suckler cows. Dairy herds are not eligible for the measure, with the exception of dairy herds of less than 40 dairy cows. Animals that are controlled by slaughtering establishments, and dealer/agent herds, are not eligible for the aid. If it is oversubscribed, payment rates may be subject to minor revision. The scheme will open for applications during the third week of August."
Volatility,Hinkley Point deal 'risky and expensive',2024-09-25,2017-06-22,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-40372613,"UK government plans for a new £18bn nuclear power station have come under fire from public auditors, who call it ""a risky and expensive project"". The National Audit Office (NAO) said the costs and risks for consumers had not been sufficiently considered. Its report comes nine months after the government granted final approval for the project, which is being financed by the French and Chinese governments. The government said building the plant was an ""important strategic decision"". State-controlled French energy firm EDF is funding two-thirds of the project, which will create more than 25,000 jobs, with China investing the remaining £6bn. Critics of the deal have warned of escalating costs and the implications of allowing nuclear power plants to be built in the UK by foreign governments.  The NAO's report centred on the role of the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) in finalising the deal in 2016. At the time, said the NAO, the department's own value-for-money tests showed ""the economic case for Hinkley Point C was marginal and subject to significant uncertainty"". ""But the department's capacity to take alternative approaches to the deal were limited after it had agreed terms,"" the NAO added. ""The government has increasingly emphasised Hinkley Point C's unquantified strategic benefits, but it has little control over these and no plan yet in place to realise them."" It added that consumers were ""locked in"" to years of paying for the plant. In response to the report, a BEIS spokesperson said building the plant was ""an important strategic decision to ensure that nuclear is part of a diverse energy mix"". The department said the project would provide ""clean, reliable electricity powering six million homes and creating more than 26,000 jobs and apprenticeships in the process"". EDF Energy said the plant ""remains good value for consumers compared with alternative choices"". The firm added:  ""Consumers won't pay a penny until the power station is operating and it is EDF Energy and [China's] CGN who will take the risk and responsibility of delivering it.  ""The project is having a major impact on the UK's industrial capacity, jobs and skills. Relaunching the UK nuclear new build industry at Hinkley Point C will enable costs for future projects, in particular Sizewell C, to be lower."" The Nuclear Industry Association (NIA) said the report showed that the plant was ""competitive with other low-carbon projects"" and that ""alternatives would cost more"". However, NIA chief executive Tom Greatrex added: ""The NAO analysis of the strike price also highlights that using a different financing structure could have resulted in a lower strike price. ""That is something government should reflect on as other new nuclear projects advance."" Speaking to the BBC, Mr Greatrex said: ""With two-thirds of our capacity coming to the end of its life by 2030, we need to replace that, we need to do that in as low-carbon a way as possible, we need to do that in a way where we're not overly exposed to the volatility of fossil fuel prices on international markets. Nuclear, alongside renewables and other technologies, helps us do that."" ""It's really important that we get new capacity built, because we've got so much that is going offline in a relatively short period of time. ""We've left it a long time, and actually saying we should reassess and start again - we haven't got the luxury of time to be able to do that."""
Volatility,Asia's richest man hits back at 'con' claims,2024-09-25,2023-01-26,By Nikhil Inamdar  and Monica Miller,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-64408720,"A company owned by Asia's richest man has hit back at a report which accused the firm of ""brazen"" stock manipulation and accounting fraud. The Adani Group, founded by Gautam Adani, called the report by a US investment firm ""malicious"" and ""selective misinformation"". The group lost almost $11bn (£8.7bn) of its market value after the research was made public on Wednesday. It is now considering legal action against New York's Hindenburg Research. Adani Group is one of India's biggest companies, and has operations in a wide range of industries including commodities trading, airports, utilities and renewable energy. It is led by Indian billionaire Mr Adani who is the world's fourth richest man, according to Forbes magazine.   Hindenburg, meanwhile, specialises in ""short-selling"", or betting against a company's share price in the expectation that it will fall.  In its report, Hindenburg accused Mr Adani of ""pulling the largest con in corporate history"". This came days ahead of a planned sale of Adani Group shares to the public. The report questioned the Adani Group's ownership of companies in offshore tax havens such as  Mauritius and the Caribbean. It also claimed Adani companies had ""substantial debt"" which put the entire group on a ""precarious financial footing"". But on Thursday, Adani Group said it was evaluating ""remedial and punitive action"" against Hindenburg Research in the US and India. Adani said it had always been ""in compliance with all laws"". ""The volatility in Indian stock markets created by the report is of great concern and has led to unwanted anguish for Indian citizens,"" said the group head of Adani's legal team, Jatin Jalundhwala.   ""Clearly, the report and its unsubstantiated contents were designed to have a deleterious effect on the share values of Adani Group companies as Hindenburg Research, by their own admission, is positioned to benefit from a slide in Adani shares."" On Thursday, Hindenburg responded to Adani's comments, saying the firm had not addressed ""a single substantive issue we had raised"". It also said it stood by its report and would ""welcome"" legal action, as any claim against it would be ""meritless"".  The group's flagship firm, Adani Enterprises, is scheduled to begin selling its shares to the public on Friday.  Opposition politicians who have long alleged that Mr Adani has benefitted because of his proximity to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi have been quick to react to the report. ""Considering that detailed research is out in the public domain, it is important that the government of India takes note of the charges made,"" tweeted Priyanka Chaturvedi, member of parliament and a Shiv Sena party leader. Another popular South Indian politician, Mr KT Ramarao, called on India's investigative agencies and market regulator to open a probe into the Adani Group's operations. But regulators are unlikely to initiate any action independently, say experts. ""The Security and Exchange Board of India [which regulates listed companies in India] will act only if there is a specific complaint sent to it. And in this case there isn't,"" said Shriram Subramaniam, founder and managing director of InGovern Research, a consultancy that advises investors on governance issues. ""There are many allegations in the report that have been the subject of regulatory scrutiny in the past."" The BBC contacted the market regulator but received no response. While it appears that the decks are clear for Adani Group to proceed with its $2.4bn public share sale on Friday, the allegations in the report could put some investors off, said Ambareesh Baliga, a financial markets analyst.  But the report could have broader consequences that go beyond the Adani Group.  Andy Mukherjee, a columnist at the news service Bloomberg, said that beyond Adani, there were ""many questions about the integrity of the broader Indian market, which is caught between the pressures of financial globalisation and political nationalism"". He added: ""Is the Security and Exchange Board of India waiting for a public outcry to go in and clean up the market?"" "
Volatility,How the UK meets record gas demand,2024-09-25,2011-02-14,John Moylan,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-12338189,"This video can not be played John Moylan visits a little known part of the UK's national energy infrastructure The UK's best kept energy secret lies some 20 miles off the East Yorkshire coast. From the air there is little to see except the dark brooding waters of the North Sea. But look closer and you will notice two gas platforms, standing defiantly above the waves. They are the only sign of a vast reservoir, a couple of miles below, which for more than quarter of a century has been the country's most important energy storage facility. The Rough gas field was discovered in the 1960s. By the 1970s it was helping heat homes and power factories. In the 1980s it was converted to enable gas to be not only taken out, but also to be pumped back in. A gas storage facility was born. The main platform is a labyrinth of pumps, pipes and compressors. In places it is showing its age, the result of decades of continuous use, exposed to the elements. But there has been sizeable investment too, allowing Rough to continue to play its key role, explains Simon Wills of Centrica Storage during a visit to the platform. The platform is showing signs of age in places During the summer months, when demand and prices tend to be low, large volumes of gas are stored in the Rough field. But now, in the midst of winter, when demand is rising and prices tend to be higher, the reservoir turns into a major supplier for homes and factories across the land. ""Rough kicks in on those very high demand days when all other sources of gas are flowing, but we need even more"", says Mr Wills. ""Some 10% of the UK's gas demand can come from this facility on any given day."" Moving such large volumes is only possible because the field is tapped, not by the usual two or three wells, but by 30. Up close, each is just a few inches in diameter. Touch them and you find each pipe is warm. It is an indication of the temperatures and pressures at play far below. This winter, Rough has been working flat out as demand from homes and power stations has soared to record levels. New figures obtained by the BBC reveal that we used more gas in 2010 than ever before. Thirty wells allow vast quantities of gas to be pumped out on cold days The year began and ended with severe cold spells as the country endured its coldest December for 100 years. Across the year the UK used 104.3 billion cubic metres (bcm), according to the National Grid, beating the last peak of 103.5 bcm in 2003. That surge comes at a time when the UK's North Sea reserves are continuing to decline. As recently as in 2003, the country was self sufficient. Today, more than half of the gas used is imported. Simon Wills says that is why we need facilities such as Rough - which helps stabilise the situation, enabling the system to respond to the huge peaks and troughs in demand throughout the year. Last autumn, the severe cold weather of November and December meant gas started flowing from Rough earlier than usual. By January, the field was just over 40% full, compared with 70% at the same time the previous year. This led to questions about the amount of gas the UK had in storage. Critics said the UK's reserves could be counted in days whereas France and Germany have several months worth of reserves. But Nick Winser, executive director of National Grid, which operates the UK's gas network, says that argument has moved on. ""We are in a different world than we were in a few years ago when basically you ran the North Sea and you topped up with storage,"" he says. ""It's all changed."" Mr Winser points to the addition of a new pipeline from Norway and several new importing terminals for Liquefied Natural gas (LNG). ""The truth is that in December the big peak of demand that we were getting on gas was met two-thirds through non storage supplies,"" he says. ""The LNG was coming out of those terminals like crazy. It really worked well, so we are in a different world now."" The gas is stored under pressures of up to 230 bar The UK's reliance on LNG looks set to grow. National Grid says that the UK will import 70% of its gas by 2020 and that up to two-thirds of that will be LNG. In the past, when LNG prices have risen around the world, shipments bound for the UK have been redirected elsewhere. Hence, the UK's growing reliance will leave the country open to the volatility of the global markets. Mr Winser says that depends upon your faith in the markets to deliver. ""We've seen North Sea gas go from self sufficient, to providing half our needs, towards 20%, he says. ""The market has seen us through an amazing transition in the last eight years. ""So at the moment the UK gas market is a real success story in the way in which it has adapted to the decline in North Sea Gas and even this winter shows the strength of the gas market."" Each platform is a labyrinth of pumps, pipes and compressors But back out at sea, Mr Wills of Centrica says that because of the growth of LNG, more facilities such as Rough will be needed. ""We will need more storage,"" he says. ""As the UK gas fields reduce, more of our gas will come in through the continent or through LNG. ""That will tend to come in reasonably flat across the year, so storage is very useful to be able to move gas from the summer through to the winter when it is needed."" Centrica is looking at a number of new storage projects. A decision on the biggest, known as Baird, which would be about half the size of Rough, is expected later this year."
Volatility,Mourning Mount Merapi's 'spiritual keeper',2024-09-25,2010-10-28,Rachel Harvey,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-11646879,"A large crowd of people attended the funeral of Maridjan, Merapi's spiritual keeper Just off the sharply inclined road, snaking its way towards Mount Merapi, there is a clearing in the forest. The land here has been terraced to accommodate the neat rows of headstones.   And for several hours on Thursday morning, almost every available space in between was filled with people.  People from different villages, different walks of life, all gathered at this cemetery to pay their respects to the most famous victim of Merapi's latest eruption.  Maridjan was appointed by a sultan to manage the volcano's hidden spirits Mbah Maridjan was ""the gate keeper"", charged by appointment to the Sultan of Yogyakarta with managing the volcano's hidden spirits. Javanese culture is full of mysticism and Maridjan took his job seriously. Too seriously perhaps. When officials came to tell him it was time to leave the volcano's lower slopes and move to safety, he refused. His place, he said, was at home, trying to pacify the spirits' brewing anger. When the burning clouds of ash descended, he, and many of those who had come to reason with him were killed.  Now he was among five victims laid to rest in the shadow of the mountain that had taken their lives.   Fresh mounds of earth, covered in flower petals, marked the new graves.   Some young men climbed the branches of trees to get a better look, as a chorus of voices recited Muslim prayers for the dead: a rhythmic chant rising up the mountainside.

And disaster is an uncomfortably regular visitor here.  Kapun is typical. I met her sitting in a school classroom, surrounded by families evacuated from the danger zone.  A large lady, with a wide smile, Kapun lives about 5km from Merapi's peak. Shortly before 1800 on Tuesday she heard a warning siren.  ""I panicked at first, then just grabbed my children and husband and jumped in the car,"" she said.   ""People were running and screaming 'it's raining ash'."" The school is now temporary home to several hundred people. Children ran around the sports hall, seemingly oblivious to the danger that lowers menacingly on the horizon.  Merapi is surrounded by beautiful verdant green countryside. At least it is usually. When the volcano started spewing hot clouds, buildings, cars, trees and paddy fields were covered in a layer of fine dusty ash, lending everything an eerie grey sheen. But on Wednesday, nature cleaned up its own mess. A heavy rainstorm washed away much of the ash in torrents of dirty water.   But as the burials took place, the rain held off and for a while it seemed even Merapi respected a brief period of mourning.  The volcano remained relatively quiet as the victims were laid to rest.    But the respite was short lived. By late Thursday afternoon, Merapi was erupting again and thousands of evacuees were preparing for another night away from home.

Volatility,How PM Modi misread the mood of India's farmers,2024-09-25,2021-01-13,By Soutik Biswas,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-55630394,"After more than 45 days of protests and eight rounds of talks with the government, India's farmers have refused to budge. Nothing short of a repeal of three market-friendly farm laws - designed to loosen rules around the sale, pricing and storage of farm produce - will make the farmers retreat from protest sites ringing the capital, Delhi. On Tuesday, the Supreme Court, responding to a bunch of petitions, put the laws on hold. The uncertainty lingers. So why did Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government fail to anticipate the blowback to the laws and misread the public mood in the affected states of Punjab and Haryana? Were they lulled into complacency because a Punjab-based ally initially supported the laws? (The Akali Dal later reversed its stand and quit the government.) Did the government believe that the laws would not lead to any significant erosion of popular support? Mr Modi has built a reputation for tough talking and playing hardball with his critics and his party is widely believed to have its ears to the ground. Protests had been brewing in Punjab even before the laws were ratified in the parliament in the middle of the pandemic last September. Angry farmers had squatted on railway tracks in protest. In late September, the regional Akali Dal had walked out.   So why was Mr Modi caught on the wrong foot by what has now grown into arguably the world's biggest protest? One reason, many believe, is that Mr Modi has not faced a mass movement against his regime. A protest by the influential Patel community in Gujarat in 2015 demanding quotas in government jobs lingered on for four years before a resolution. A months-long protest led mostly by Muslim women in a Delhi neighbourhood against the controversial Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) was cleared last March amid measures to curb the spread of coronavirus. But none were as large and intense as the ongoing protests, and did not challenge the government in the way the defiant farmers have.  ""I don't think Mr Modi misread the situation because he had no knowledge about the protests in Punjab. I think the overconfidence arose from his inexperience in dealing with mass protests,"" says Prof Parminder Singh, a civil rights activist. Second, the current protests are significantly different from similar agitations in India's history. In colonial India, peasant revolts against exploitative rulers often turned violent. Since Independence in 1947, farmers have staged demonstrations against falling crop prices, indebtedness and farm distress. But none have seen the staggering levels of cohesion and mobilisation - involving some 40 farmers' unions, more than half a million protesters, and large swathes of civil society - as the ongoing agitation.  The protests have originated in Punjab, the relatively prosperous farming heartland of India. Along with its neighbour Haryana, the two states have benefited most from India's farm policies. These farmers are now frustrated over stagnant and falling farm incomes and fear that entry of private businesses will hurt their future. The protests have now widened to coalesce around a range of anxieties over farming in India - shrinking plots of land, diminished produce, volatility in crop prices, and centralisation of lawmaking in a country where farming matters are mainly entrusted with the states.   ""The protest is more than an arena of grievances,"" Pratap Bhanu Mehta, professor of political science at Ashoka University, told me. ""It's also about a lack of trust in the government and an assertive articulation of federalism.""  At the protest sites, the mood is one of unbending resistance against the government. ""People here are calling it a revolution for our rights,"" Surmeet Mavi, one of the editors of Trolley Times, a daily newsletter published from the protest site, told me. ""It's a feeling of fearlessly taking on the powerful government."" For decades, the dominant stereotype of the Indian farmer has been one of a semi-literate, struggling man, who tirelessly ploughs the land. The reality is that India's 150-odd million farmers are of different kinds - the big and small; the landed and the landless. So when it was reported that the protesters were having pizzas, there was some unkind social media chatter about whether these people really worked on the farms. It laid bare, again, how little urban Indians know about their rural brethren. What Mr Modi's government and many people have possibly failed to understand is that many of the protesting farmers have deep linkages with urbanity.  Many of them have children in the army and police, speak English, use social media and have both travelled and have relatives abroad. The protest sites are well organised with clinics, ambulances, kitchens, facilities, libraries, and even its own newspaper. Like most urban protests, there's the risk of the media-fuelled spectacle overtaking the underlying complexities of the agitation. ""This farmer movement speaks the language of middle-class India. They are saying they are patriotic, and fighting for the rights they hold dear,"" says historian Mahesh Rangarajan. This is also not a conventional protest against farm distress or drought, which most governments have been successful at managing. This agitation is ironically a consequence of Punjab's success in farming - the state is the biggest beneficiary of government-guaranteed prices of wheat and rice, and elaborate state-supported marketing structures.  These have now become a millstone around Punjab's neck - a glut of two crops has led to overflowing stocks, stagnating incomes and depleting groundwater. ""The challenge is that Punjab has been unable to transition from a largely well-to-do farming society to one where there is environmentally sustainable agriculture and industrialisation,"" says Prof Mehta.  More than 85% of India's farmers are small and marginal, and they work on some 47% of the total farming land. Both the government and farmers agree that farming needs reform. But they cannot agree on specifics. ""There are solutions. But the farmers don't trust the government,"" says Prof Mehta. And therein lies the real problem."
Volatility,Brexit issues 'may shut offshore platforms',2024-09-25,2018-09-10,By Kevin Keane,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-45474989,"Oil and gas platforms could have to be shut down if a deal on Brexit leads to difficulties accessing skilled workers, according to an industry report. The warning comes in Oil and Gas UK's latest economic report. It said delays in accessing labour markets from EU countries have the potential, in some instances, of leading to production being shut in. The UK government said employers could continue recruiting from Europe up until 2020. The report said about 5% of workers in the UK oil and gas sector come from other EU countries. That figure rises to seven percent for the offshore workforce. The report said it was ""vital that arrangements are in place between the UK and EU to allow the continued frictionless movement of people"". One example related to emergency response vessels stationed close to platforms, which require skilled engineers to operate. The report said that if difficulties arose in recruiting replacements then platforms would have to shut down operations and production. To minimise the impact of Brexit, Oil and Gas UK said it was vital that the UK government secured frictionless access to markets and labour, maintained a strong voice in Europe for the industry, and protected the internal energy market. The 2018 Economic Report revealed that oil prices in the first half of the year were 30% higher than 2017, averaging more than $70 per barrel. Along with the continued drive to bring down costs, that was estimated to have created more than £10bn of free cash flow. But it said investors ""will continue to favour a conservative outlook"" because of the continued volatility of the oil price. Chief executive Deirdre Michie said: ""Industry is emerging from one of the most testing downturns in its history. However, the steps that have been taken by industry, government and the regulator have delivered tangible results. ""Despite the improvements seen in recent years, we find ourselves at a crossroads. Record low drilling activity, coupled with the supply chain squeeze, threaten industry's ability to effectively service an increase in activity and maximise economic recovery. ""The UK Continental Shelf (UKCS) is a more attractive investment proposition - our challenge now is to take advantage of this. ""We have to drive an increase in activity while continuing to find and implement even more efficient ways of working which support the health of supply chain companies whilst also keeping costs under control."" The report said the cost of producing oil had halved since its peak and was now averaging around $15 per barrel. This has followed an industry-wide drive to bring down costs and extend the life of the UK sector. A spokesman for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: ""The oil and gas industry is crucial to the UK's economy and energy security. That's why we are providing a £2.3bn support package of measures. ""EU citizens make a huge contribution to the oil and gas industry and we've provided certainty to the industry that employers will be free to continue recruiting from Europe up until 2020."""

Potter took on development roles at two universities, Hull and then Leeds Metropolitan after hanging up his boots, while also completing a Master's in leadership and emotional intelligence.  ""In football you can work hard, play well and still lose,"" Potter continued.  ""It is a game so you can lose, so I liked the idea of working towards something and getting something you cannot take away from you [a degree]. That's what you get from the education sector.  ""I would like to think it made me more rounded.  ""I was not confident when I stopped playing, I did not like standing up in front of people or the sound of my own voice.  ""I needed to try and gain some confidence. I did not just want to be the ex-footballer. I wanted to be more than that and I liked learning. ""I remember getting on the team bus after one game, my degree was in American politics and the EU, and the lads were looking at me going 'what on earth are you doing?' But I enjoyed it."" Then came the task of turning theory into practice.  ""I was 30 years-old and had stopped playing. I realised I wanted to coach and I wasn't going to get the opportunities but also I wasn't good enough to get the opportunities as a 30-year-old ex-player for 12-13 years,"" Potter explains. ""My skillset at that particular time wasn't good enough to get a coaching job at any sort of level. Like everybody I needed to learn to be a coach, I needed to practise that and make mistakes in a decent environment where I could develop myself and not fear I was going to lose my job. ""I had five years in the university sector which was a time where I could make my mistakes, develop with the students and players there. I also worked with the people at the university to put some concept and theory on my own experiences."" Graham Potter and Jamie Hopcutt of Ostersunds FK celebrates after the victory during the Allsvenskan match between Ostersunds FK and IK Sirius FK Potter's route to the Liberty Stadium, via coaching students and then seven years building success in Sweden at Ostersunds FK is far from conventional. Potter believes his experiences in the classroom have equipped him for management, every bit as well as time spent in dressing rooms. ""It was an important thing for me to do over that five-year period. I [already] had experiences as a player,"" he said. ""I was fairly rubbish as a player. I was never going to get these great jobs on the back of my glittering playing career. ""So then I needed to work out how to communicate, how to lead people, how to structure a programme and when you are working in an university, it seemed sensible to take advantage of the programmes that were there. ""The programme that I did I was with surgeons; I spent time with [people from] the military so you are starting to get an understanding of leadership from different contexts. ""It's then about applying it to football. Ultimately you still have to try and get good players on the pitch and win football matches. ""You are dealing with people, you are dealing with stress, you are dealing with a loss of confidence, you are dealing with interpersonal relationships. To have an understanding like that is important. ""It's not just about putting on a training session."" Ostersunds FK players celebrate their unlikely victory at Arsenal in last season's Europa League Not afraid to try things that would seem alien to many in football, Potter's embracing of the culture in Sweden has seen him do some things that would be viewed as highly unconventional. Like what, you might ask? Well, like putting on a ballet production, featuring Ostersund players and staff, for the local community. ""I was doing an improvised dance solo in the middle of the stage on my own which was terrible, it really was. I was also involved in some of the dance moves. I am just an all-round bad dancer,"" he said of the club's production of Swan Lake.  That was not even his musical highlight. ""We also did a singing performance in front of 1,600 people where I performed the Yampland national anthem, in the local dialect, as the opening bit of the show. That was daunting,"" he recalled. ""But for supporters to see players as human beings, with their families and doing more than putting the shirt on is important.  ""You are asking them to have a little bit of patience and if they have had time with you and connected with you in some way, they can be even more supportive of you."" So while it is fair to say Potter is fully focused on getting the Swans to the Premier League, do not be surprised to see him at an Eisteddfod near you.

Volatility,Pound and UK shares hit by Brexit turmoil,2024-09-25,2018-11-15,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46219038,"The pound and shares in housebuilders and banks have fallen sharply after cabinet ministers Dominic Raab and Esther McVey quit over Prime Minister Theresa May's draft Brexit deal. Royal Bank of Scotland sank 9%, with 7% falls for Persimmon, Taylor Wimpey and Barratt Developments. Sterling fell 1.7% against the dollar and 1.9% against the euro. The FTSE 100 index closed little moved, but the FTSE 250, which mainly comprises UK-focused firms, fell 1.6%. Capita topped the fallers in the FTSE 250, plunging 14%, with Countryside Properties down 9%. Shares in companies that do most or all of their business in the UK reflected the continued political uncertainty, as members of the Conservative Party and opposition politicians voiced their scepticism over the draft deal.  ""The market has taken a big red pen to stocks which are heavily exposed to the UK economy like the banks, retailers and housebuilders,"" said Laith Khalaf at Hargreaves Lansdown. ""These sectors were already under pressure, but the potential for an orderly Brexit to unravel in the next few days is causing further distress to be manifested in share prices."" BBC business editor Simon Jack said: ""The odds of a general election have just gone up and that means the possibility of a Corbyn government must have increased as well.  ""Markets don't like the prospect of that because of Labour's intention to raise taxes on companies and nationalise large sections of the economy."" The higher chances of an election was one of the reasons behind RBS' steep fall, as the Labour Party has said it would nationalise the lender. However, shares in other banks also fell, as investors considered the threat to the economy and therefore to banks' balance sheets if the UK were to leave the EU without a deal. Sterling ended the day in London at under $1.28 against the dollar after a turbulent day's trading.  Initially on Wednesday, when Theresa May announced she had secured cabinet backing for the draft Brexit agreement with Brussels, the pound recovered earlier lost ground. But by Thursday morning it was already wavering.  A string of ministerial resignations led by Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab and Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey, undermined confidence in the pound further as market observers deemed the chances of a disorderly Brexit had risen. The Brexit process has been punctuated by big movements in the pound's relationship with the dollar, something which can lead to big gains or losses for investors.   In the run-up to, and immediate aftermath of the Brexit referendum on 23 June 2016, for example, the pound hit a peak of volatility against the dollar.  And as the graphic below shows, the events surrounding Wednesday's draft agreement has triggered the greatest volatility for sterling since the referendum.  Jane Foley at Rabobank said the pound's plunge was ""firmly tied"" to the perception that Mrs May will have difficulty in pushing the Brexit plan through Parliament.   She said the resignations had increased speculation that the prime minister would face a no-confidence vote, something that would weigh heavily on the pound: ""Any turn of events that could raise the risk of a general election would also punish the pound, given the risk of a market-unfriendly far-left government."" Chris Turner at ING said Mr Raab's resignation had increased the chances of a leadership challenge and a no-deal Brexit.  He said the pound ""could fall another 3-4% unless the threat of a leadership election is quashed or there are clearer signs that the withdrawal agreement can garner more support in parliament"".   Organisations that speak on behalf of business like the Confederation of British Industry welcomed the draft deal, because it offered the prospect of a smooth path towards Brexit. The CBI described the agreement as a ""compromise, including for business"" but was happy that it represented a ""step back from the cliff-edge"". The agreement includes a 21-month transition period, during which time the UK will negotiate new trade terms with the EU. The UK would have a unilateral right to extend that transition period, which was described as ""very positive for business"" by James Stewart, head of Brexit at KPMG. Northern Ireland also has the guarantee of a ""friction-free"" customs border with the Republic of Ireland. CBI Director-general Carolyn Fairbairn told the BBC: ""There is a possible path to frictionless trade now in terms of negotiating the final deal. I don't think anyone thinks the transition or the backstop is the answer, so this has to be used as a route to a final deal with frictionless trade and access for services."" Of course not.  Pro-Brexit economist Gerard Lyons, chief economic strategist at Netwealth Investment and former chief economic adviser to Boris Johnson while he was Mayor of London, says the draft withdrawal deal is not something to cheer about. ""Whilst it has avoided the cliff edge, I think it's important we don't bury our heads in the sands here and view this as a 'good' deal - this is still disappointing,"" he said. Those who had hoped the draft deal would supply some reassurance will also be disappointed as Theresa May wrestles with critics and struggles to unite enough MPs behind her plan."
Volatility,Brexit: Where we are in seven charts,2024-09-25,2018-11-16,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-46234602,"UK Prime Minister Theresa May has dismissed speculation she could be ousted as leader despite a series of ministers resigning over her long-awaited Brexit deal. Mrs May has vowed to get her draft withdrawal agreement signed off in Brussels and put before MPs in defiance of a possible vote of no-confidence in her.  Such a vote could lead to her removal as prime minister and a change of course on Brexit.  Here are seven charts that will help explain what's going on. The draft EU withdrawal agreement negotiated by Mrs May is set to be signed off by European leaders at an emergency summit on 25 November. But if Mrs May survives as PM she faces a battle to get MPs to back it in a House of Commons vote.  Mrs May does not have a Commons majority and many MPs on her own side - as well as Labour and the other opposition parties - are sceptical about her Brexit deal, or even openly hostile to it.  Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, which Mrs May relies on in key votes, has already said it is likely to vote against the deal, claiming it will lead to the break-up of the United Kingdom. A number of Conservative MPs on both the Remain and Leave wings of the party have also said they will vote against it. The vote is expected to take place around 7 December. Transport Minister Jo Johnson, Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab and Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey - along with more junior ministers - have all resigned over the Brexit deal in the last week. They followed a flurry of other resignations in July - among them ex-Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and former Brexit Secretary David Davis. Looking back, Mrs May's tenure actually got off to a relatively strong and stable start.  She had no resignations in her first 475 days as prime minister, before Michael Fallon was forced to resign as defence secretary in November 2017.  Former prime minister David Cameron, by contrast, had David Laws leave his post as chief secretary to the Treasury over expenses claims after just 10 days. In just over a year, however, Mrs May has lost eight ministers, taking her level with Mr Cameron in just half the time. The only recent prime minister to come close to her rate of resignations is Gordon Brown, who lost five ministers in three days in June 2009 after a poor showing in local and European elections. Some departments appear more likely to experience resignations than others.  Of the 32 cabinet ministers who have quit since 1997, six have been work and pensions: Andrew Smith and David Blunkett under Tony Blair, Peter Hain and James Purnell under Gordon Brown, Iain Duncan-Smith in David Cameron's cabinet, and Esther McVey under Mrs May. There have already been two Brexit secretaries, despite it only being a Cabinet position since July 2016. If you'd bought £10 worth of dollars at the beginning of the day on Thursday, you'd have got $12.99 in return. By the end of the day it would have bought you $12.77 - a difference of 1.7%. The resignations of Dominic Raab, Esther McVey and other more junior ministers appeared to have a bigger impact than those of Boris Johnson and David Davis over the summer. However, neither of the two rounds of resignations was as significant as Britain voting to leave back in June 2016, though - the pound dropped more than 10% between 21.40 BST and midnight. The draft agreement on Britain's withdrawal from the EU, due to be signed off by European leaders next month, is just the beginning of the process of leaving. The deal needs to be backed by UK Parliament, voted for by the European Parliament and approved by the EU Council before the UK can officially leave on 29 March 2019. However, the agreement is not a trade deal - details of that have yet to be hammered out. That is set to happen during the transition period, if all goes as planned.  However, if Mrs May loses the vote in Parliament, the UK enters uncharted territory. The PM may seek to renegotiate with the EU, but most expect her time in Downing Street to end.  There could be a general election and/or a new prime minister. This would trigger a vote of confidence in Mrs May among all Tory MPs. It would be a secret ballot, and if she won, she would be immune from challenge for a year. But if she lost, there would be a leadership contest, and she would not be able to stand. Unless there is a general election, the winner of any Tory leadership contest would also be expected to become prime minister.

Volatility,Treasury rejects U-turn on mini-budget despite turmoil,2024-09-25,2022-09-28,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-63067163,"The government will not abandon its mini-budget despite the Bank of England having to step in amid market turmoil, a Treasury minister has said. Labour called for the tax-cutting measures to be ditched after they sparked a fall in the pound and a surge in borrowing costs. Government departments are also being asked to find spending cuts. Treasury minister Andrew Griffith said the government's proposals were the ""right plans"" to grow the UK economy. He claimed ""every major economy is dealing with exactly the same issues"" and said the impact of ""Putin's war in Ukraine is cascading through things like the cost of energy, some of the supply side implications of that"". The value of the pound dropped to $1.05 on Wednesday, after the Bank of England stepped in to stabilise the economy, before later rallying to about $1.08. On Wednesday, the Bank announced it would buy government bonds on a temporary basis to help ""restore orderly market conditions"".  Some pension funds hold a lot of government bonds, because they are normally a stable investment, but as their value dropped there were concerns over the solvency of some funds, the BBC has been told.  The Bank's moves on Wednesday followed a highly-critical intervention from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which warned the measures were likely to fuel the cost-of-living crisis.  Meanwhile, Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Chris Philp, has confirmed he is asking government departments to find savings. Speaking on ITV's Peston, Mr Philp said government departments are being asked to ""look for efficiencies wherever they can find them"". These efficiencies will ""stick to the targets"" of the 2021 Comprehensive Spending Review ""that set out three year spending plan"", Mr Philp said. Any savings will ""enable us to target spending on things that target growth,"" he added. Gerard Lyons, an economist who has spoken in support of the mini-budget, criticised the Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng for ""failing"" to warn financial markets about the plans.  ""Ahead of the budget, it was necessary for the chancellor to keep financial markets on-side,"" Mr Lyons told BBC Two's Newsnight. ""The chancellor appealed to domestic population and appealed to a domestic business community, but one key group he failed to keep on-side was the financial market."" Conservative MP Mel Stride has criticised the government for not publishing a forecast of the UK's economic outlook from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) - saying it needs to do so ""as soon as possible"". Forecasts from the independent OBR give an indication of the health of the nation's finances. The BBC understands the government was given a draft before announcing the tax cuts, but it has not been published. ""The OBR should have been brought in earlier,"" said Mr Stride, the chairman of the Treasury select committee. He said the OBR forecast could have then be used to reassure the markets.  ""It is urgently important that the government and the Treasury comes forward at the earliest possible time now with that OBR forecast, with what their fiscal target is going to be, so they can turn and face the markets and say this is this is all fiscally credible."" But Mr Philp said an OBR report will not be published until 23 November, when Mr  Kwarteng plans to set out a ""Medium-Term Fiscal Plan"". This will allow the OBR forecasts to be done ""in a way that's organised and thoughtful,"" Mr Philp said. Downing Street rejected calls for Parliament to be recalled after calls from Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer to do so MPs can overturn last week's mini-budget. Parliament is currently suspended while the two main parties hold their annual conferences. It is due to come back on 11 October. The £45bn package of tax cuts announced last week would repair ""underlying problems in the economy,"" Mr Griffith said. He added the Bank of England had ""done their job"" by announcing it would buy government debt to stabilise the economy. Few Conservative MPs are commenting publicly about Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng's handling of the economic turmoil sparked by his mini-budget - but they are not mincing their words in off-the-record conversations. Inept, humiliating, naive and reckless are just some of the words that have cropped up. What is so irritating to many of them is that this financial instability was predicted - by none other than former chancellor and leadership candidate Rishi Sunak. Some, who describe themselves as ""critical but sensible"", are dismissing ""idiotic talk"" of trying to oust the prime minister. But there is huge pressure on the chancellor, who they accuse of an ""appalling lapse in political judgement"". Read more here. Mr Kwarteng, who unveiled the tax-cutting package last Friday, is yet to speak publicly on the growing impact of the package on markets.  The Treasury said the plans would be funded by £72bn of borrowing and there is an expectation this will surge as interest rates rise.  The pound slumped following his statement and later fell to a record low against the dollar after Mr Kwarteng hinted there were more tax cuts to come.  Julian Smith became the first former cabinet minister to call for the government to ""make changes"". The former Northern Ireland Secretary, who backed Rishi Sunak to become prime minister, tweeted: ""It is critical that the government is honest about the current situation and plays its part in stabilising markets. ""It can keep a growth plan but needs to make changes. Not doing so will only continue further stress and strain on UK citizens."" Speaking to broadcasters, Mr Griffith, the Financial Secretary to the Treasury, insisted the UK had a ""very strong balance sheet"" and one of the lowest debt to GDP ratios of major economies. Asked whether the government had any plans to change Friday's measures, he replied: ""We think they're the right plans, because those plans make our economy competitive"". ""At the end of the day, that's ultimately what we've got to do,"" he said, saying ministers were focused on ""getting on and delivering"" its plans to work."
Volatility,Going green could save world 'trillions' - study,2024-09-25,2022-09-13,By Jonah Fisher,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-62892013,"Switching from fossil fuels to renewable energy could save the world as much as $12tn (£10.2tn) by 2050, an Oxford University study says. The report said it was wrong and pessimistic to claim that moving quickly towards cleaner energy sources was expensive. Gas prices have soared on mounting concerns over energy supplies. But the researchers say that going green now makes economic sense because of the falling cost of renewables. ""Even if you're a climate denier, you should be on board with what we're advocating,"" Prof Doyne Farmer from the Institute for New Economic Thinking at the Oxford Martin School told BBC News. ""Our central conclusion is that we should go full speed ahead with the green energy transition because it's going to save us money,"" he said. The report's findings are based on looking at historic price data for renewables and fossil fuels and then modelling how they're likely to change in the future. The data for fossil fuels goes from 2020 back more than 100 years and shows that after accounting for inflation, and market volatility, the price hasn't changed much. Renewables have only been around for a few decades, so there's less data. But in that time continual improvements in technology have meant the cost of solar and wind power have fallen rapidly, at a rate approaching 10% a year. The report's expectation that the price of renewables will continue to fall is based on ""probabilistic"" modelling, using data on how massive investment and economies of scale have made other similar technologies cheaper.  ""Our latest research shows scaling-up key green technologies will continue to drive their costs down, and the faster we go, the more we will save,"" says Dr Rupert Way, the report's lead author from the Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment. Wind and solar are already the cheapest option for new power projects, but questions remain over how to best store power and balance the grid when the changes in the weather leads to fall in renewable output. Back in 2019 Philip Hammond, then Chancellor of the Exchequer wrote to the prime minister to say that the cost of reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 in the UK would be more than £1tn. This report says the likely costs have been over-estimated and have deterred investment.  It also says predictions by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that the cost of keeping global temperatures rises under 2 degrees would correspond to a loss of GDP by 2050 were too pessimistic. The transition to renewables was, it says, likely to turn out to be a ""net economic benefit"". The research has been published in the journal Joule and is a collaboration between the Institute for New Economic Thinking at the Oxford Martin School, the Oxford Martin Programme on the Post-Carbon Transition, the Smith School of Enterprise & Environment at the University of Oxford, and SoDa Labs at Monash University.

Volatility,UK forecast to have slowest growth in G7 next year,2024-09-25,2022-04-19,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-61142906,"The war in Ukraine will ""severely set back"" the global economic recovery with the UK hit harder than most, the International Monetary Fund has said.  The conflict is driving up prices for food and fuel which the international body expects to slow growth globally. It has cut its global forecast and also downgraded its outlook for the UK. This means the UK will no longer be the fastest growing economy in the G7 group of leading Western nations, and will be the slowest in 2023, it says. The body says that UK growth will slow as price pressures lead households to cut spending, while rising interest rates are expected to ""cool investment"". The UK's economy is now predicted to grow by 3.7% this year, down from the previous forecast of 4.7% made in January. However, next year, the UK is expected to have the slowest growth in the G7 and across Europe's main economies, at just 1.2%, a near halving from the 2.3% expected previously. The 2023 UK figure is the slowest apart from heavily-sanctioned Russia in the wider G20 grouping, which includes nations such as China and India. The IMF said that the UK was the fastest growing G7 economy in 2021, and is forecast to be the second fastest in 2022. The low UK growth rates forecast in 2023 are in part due to the UK rebounding more quickly from the pandemic than some of its G7 peers. However, the UK is also wrestling with high inflation, which will hit growth in 2023, as people cut spending as their real income shrinks, the IMF said. The organisation expects inflation to peak in late 2022 at 9%. It said rising interest rates will also slow the UK economy in 2023 and 2023, while government policies such as getting rid of certain tax breaks will reduce business investment at that time. In addition, Brexit will hold back export growth, the IMF said, and it will continue to make pandemic-related labour supply ""scarring"" worse by reducing immigration. ""However, the impact of Brexit is spread over several years and is not the primary driver of the slowdown in 2023,"" a spokesperson for the organisation added. The IMF works with its 189 member countries to try to stabilise the global economy, including issuing short-term loans and assistance to countries who are struggling. It said inflation was now a ""clear and present danger"" in many countries and the situation has added to supply strains from the coronavirus pandemic. ""In the matter of a few weeks, the world has yet again experienced a major, transformative shock,"" IMF director of research Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas wrote in the organisation's 2022 World Economic Outlook. ""Just as a durable recovery from the pandemic-induced global economic collapse appeared in sight, the war has created the very real prospect that a large part of the recent gains will be erased.""  The organisation said it expected global growth of just 3.6% this year, down nearly a percentage point from its forecast before the war.  The World Bank also said it was lowering its growth forecast from 4.1% to 3.2%.  The conflict has already devastated the economies of Ukraine and Russia, which the West cut off from key trade and financial networks with sanctions following the invasion. Ukraine is facing a severe contraction of 35% or more this year, while Russia's economy is expected to shrink by 8.5%, the IMF said. But with Russia a major energy producer and key supplier of staples such as wheat and corn alongside Ukraine, the consequences will ripple far beyond their borders, the IMF warned. There have been two acute shocks to the world economy in quick succession - the pandemic and the Ukraine war. The latter is building on the problems created by the former, tripping up what had been a healthy recovery, and sending prices rising at an even faster rate. Food and energy prices were already being hiked by the supply bottlenecks after the pandemic, before one of the world's biggest energy suppliers invaded one of the world's biggest food exporter. But now there are new bottlenecks emerging from the stringent Covid lockdowns in some regions of China. Rising prices risk social stability in poorer countries, dependent on food imports. Fears about inflation becoming entrenched are leading the world's central bankers to raise interest rates. In turn that is raising the cost of borrowing for the record debts many nations racked up during the pandemic. So all this requires some skill and cooperation among the old and new financial powerhouses of the world. But that has been another commodity in short supply in recent times. ""The economic effects of the war are spreading far and wide - like seismic waves that emanate from the epicenter of an earthquake,"" it said. In Germany, where the economy is especially closely entwined, the war is likely to lower growth by 1.7 percentage points, it said. Even in countries with little direct trade with Russia and Ukraine, households will feel the effects of the war, as central banks respond to the more rapid inflation by raising interest rates, making borrowing more expensive, the IMF said. In the US, for example, the organisation lowered its forecast for growth in 2022 by 0.3 percentage points to 3.7%, citing the prospect of more aggressive interest rate rises.  Overall, inflation pressures are significantly worse than they were when the IMF issued its previous forecast in January. It now predicts inflation in ""advanced economies"" will hit 5.7% this year, while it is likely to reach 8.7% in emerging markets.  UK inflation is expected to be 5.3% next year - the highest in the G7, and higher than all EU members, and only exceeded in the G20 by crisis-ridden Argentina, Turkey and Russia. ""Inflation has become a clear and present danger for many countries,"" Mr Gourinchas wrote in a blog. A few countries, such as oil exporters, are benefiting. The IMF expects growth in Saudi Arabia, for example, to be stronger than it did in January. But the risks are not purely economic, the IMF added.  It said the war had also created a refugee crisis and aggravated political tensions, risking a ""more permanent fragmentation of the world economy into geopolitical blocks with distinct technology standards, cross-border payment systems, and reserve currencies"".  ""Such a 'tectonic shift' would cause long-run efficiency losses, increase volatility and represent a major challenge to the rules-based framework that has governed international and economic relations for the last 75 years,"" the IMF said. A Treasury spokesperson said the IMF forecasts ""will be concerning for many people and families"" in the UK. ""However the support we provided over the past two years has put our economy in a good position to deal with these headwinds, including through record numbers of employees on payrolls and a strong economic recovery from the pandemic,"" the spokesperson said. Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said the IMF forecast ""shows the extreme challenges facing the UK economy"". ""While it is true that global forces play a role, the fact that the UK is forecast to have the slowest growth of any G7 economy next year plus the highest inflation, shows the uniquely bad situation the UK is in. ""Inflation spiralling out of control this year has created a cost of living crisis hitting families across the country, needing decisive and urgent action,"" she said, repeating Labour calls for a windfall tax on oil and gas firms. Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Christine Jardine said the UK government had ""failed to shield the UK from spiralling energy bills and soaring inflation, but they have gone ahead with raising people's taxes to their highest point in 70 years""."
Volatility,Transport firms feeling pinch of rising fuel costs,2024-09-25,2022-03-07,By Niall Glynn,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-60650159,"The conflict in Ukraine continues to affect the cost of oil and gas, putting a further squeeze on the cost of living.  World oil prices have jumped to $139 (£106) a barrel, the highest level for almost 14 years. The Northern Ireland Consumer Council has found 500 litres of home heating oil costs £559.50 - an increase of 75% since 23 February. And petrol and diesel prices continue to soar. Petrol prices of £1.65 per litre have been reported in parts of Northern Ireland, with diesel prices close to £1.80 per litre some places. Those compare to around the £1.20 per litre mark a year ago, and prices are unlikely to fall any time soon. The owner of a County Fermanagh fuel company is predicting that diesel prices could hit £2 per litre by the end of this week.  Garry Jennings, from Jennings Fuels and Lubricants in Kesh, said as well as volatility in oil market, there are issues with supplies coming into Northern Ireland.  ""We are selling the fuel we've bought in on Friday, tonight it looks like there's going to be another 10p on oil and that's going to come to us tomorrow morning.  ""We buy on the day and try and sell on the day so this is fuel we bought in on Friday, tomorrow's fuel is going to be 10p up, what's going to happen Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday?""  The Northern Ireland Oil Federation (NIOF) have said there is no issue with supplies, but they are dealing with a 10-day backlog of orders due to mass panic-buying. While some drivers may be able to travel less or use public transport, that is not an option for transport companies. Stephen Anton, from taxi company Fonacab, said rising fuel prices are felt directly by taxi drivers as they are self employed and account for all of their income and costs individually. ""In other words, they fuel their vehicles, the cost of doing so an expense against their booking income,"" Mr Anton said.  ""While drivers can offset fuel costs against their taxable income, the increased fuel costs affect what they take home on a day-to-day basis."" He added: ""If this continues to be a problem, it has the potential to impact negatively on taxi driver numbers across Northern Ireland.  ""Many drivers left the industry for various reasons during Covid and a substantial number have not returned, instead taking early retirement or remaining in other jobs they secured during lockdowns.  ""A sustained high fuel cost may encourage some other drivers to do the same."" Mr Anton said the company was conscious that customers are feeling cost of living increases in their pockets too and did not want to increase fares unnecessarily.  ""There is a balancing act to ensuring that prices remain competitive and affordable for our customers and are also sufficient to allow drivers to make a living and work to provide the services that customers need,"" he said.  ""The current fuel price increases make this a more difficult exercise than ever. ""From our perspective, anything that can be done to reduce fuel costs for drivers' vehicles is a priority.  ""A temporary decrease in fuel duty would be welcome, and there are other tools that local government can employ to reduce overall costs for drivers - for example, reducing the cost of an annual PSV for a taxi to that of an MoT.""  Paul Stewart, from courier firm NI Parcels, said fuel prices had been increasing ""slowly but surely"" over the last year. ""However, in the last six weeks the increases have been huge,"" he said.  ""It has been the largest increase I have ever seen in our business.  ""We have been absorbing some of the increases ourselves, but there is only so much you can absorb, so this has now resulted in some of the increased costs onto our customers.  ""As the fuel prices change so regularly, it is difficult to keep changing your prices and this could make our business look unprofessional. ""It is a very difficult time to absorb the costs or increase prices, we have done a blend of both for now.""   Mr Stewart said the full costs have not been passed onto customers, meaning a reduction in profits for the company.  ""The main issue is the constant price changes making it difficult to set prices, some form of price freeze or price caps would be hugely appreciated,"" he said. ""As the fuel price increases so does the revenue collected on the duty on the increased prices. Duty on fuel could be reduced to help with these increases."" "
Volatility,Sunak 'believes in lower taxes' despite April rise,2024-09-25,2022-02-23,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60498425,"Chancellor Rishi Sunak has pledged to ""deliver a low tax, higher growth economy"" amid criticism from MPs over rises to National Insurance. Mr Sunak told an audience at the Bayes Business School on Thursday that he would cut taxes ""sustainably"". It comes as National Insurance rates are set to rise from 1 April to help fund health and social care. The rise means employees, employers and the self-employed will all pay 1.25p more in the pound. ""I am going to deliver a lower tax economy but I am going to do so in a responsible way, and in a way that tackles our long term challenges,"" Mr Sunak said in his speech. ""I firmly believe in lower taxes."" However, the chancellor also argued that taxes should not be cut if spending plans are unfunded. Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said the Conservative Party was ""now the party of high tax"". ""The chancellor may say he 'believes' in low taxes in his lecture - but the hard facts are that Sunak has hit households and business with 15 tax rises in two years in post - with an unfair National Insurance rise down the line,"" Ms Reeves said. ""He has raised the most tax on average per budget than any chancellor in the last 50 years."" Labour Party leader Sir Keir Starmer was set to deliver a speech in Huddersfield outlining his party's approach to taxation and ending insecure employment, but it was cancelled due to the Ukraine crisis. Sir Keir had planned to say that a Labour government would end the ""economic fatalism"" of the Conservatives and build ""a new economy of security, where stable employment will be the bedrock of a better future for the next generation"". Mr Sunak said he was ""disheartened when I hear the flippant claim that 'tax cuts always pay for themselves'"". ""They do not,"" he added. ""Cutting tax sustainably requires hard work, prioritisation, and the willingness to make difficult and often unpopular arguments elsewhere."" In Mr Sunak's two years in his role he has overseen hundreds of billions in Covid-related government spending through furlough payments, business grants and testing.  He has also been at the helm as taxation as a share of the economy has risen to its highest level since the 1950s. Under the government's plans, employees, employers and the self-employed will all pay 1.25p more in the pound for National Insurance from April for a year. After that, the extra tax will be collected as a new Health and Social Care Levy. The changes will see an employee on £20,000 a year pay an extra £89 in tax, while someone on £50,000 will pay £464 more. The Liberal Democrats and some backbench Tory MPs have called for the chancellor to scrap the incoming NI hike to ease the financial burden on households and businesses at a time of rising costs. In the speech Mr Sunak also set out his priorities to increase the UK's economic growth, and argued that ""what government does is far less important than creating the conditions for private businesses and individuals to thrive"". Tony Danker, director general of the business group the CBI, said setting out how firms could ""achieve sustainable growth for the long term"" was ""vital"" at a period of volatility in the economy.  ""Government enabling firms to invest, thrive and deliver prosperity is absolutely the right direction of travel,"" he added. Mr Danker has called for a permanent ""super-deduction"" tax break to boost business investment in the UK. The super-deduction allowance currently gives businesses investing in certain types of equipment, like machinery, a much higher tax reduction than usual but will expire in March next year."
Volatility,US regulators warn banks over cryptocurrency risks,2024-09-25,2023-01-04,By Annabelle  Liang,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-64159452,"US regulators have issued their first ever joint warning to banks over the risks associated with the cryptocurrency market. The watchdogs told financial institutions to be wary of potential fraud, legal uncertainty and misleading disclosures by digital asset firms. Banks were also cautioned over the ""contagion risk"" from the sector. It comes just two months after the collapse of trading platform FTX sent shockwaves through the crypto industry. In the joint statement, the US Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said they were closely monitoring the crypto activities of banking organisations. ""The events of the past year have been marked by significant volatility and the exposure of vulnerabilities in the crypto-asset sector,"" the statement said. The regulators also said that issuing or holding crypto tokens, which are stored on public, decentralised networks was ""highly likely to be inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices"". Banks were also encouraged to take steps to avoid problems in the digital asset market spreading to the wider financial system. ""It is important that risks related to the crypto-asset sector that cannot be mitigated or controlled do not migrate to the banking system,"" it added. Tuesday's statement comes after months of hesitancy by US financial industry watchdogs to issue uniform guidelines on cryptocurrencies, despite banks inviting clearer advice from regulators. The cryptocurrency industry was rocked by the collapse of FTX in November.  It was the world's second largest cryptocurrency exchange and the entry point for millions of people into the digital asset market. On Tuesday, FTX's former chief executive Sam Bankman-Fried officially denied charges that he defrauded customers and investors. He pleaded not guilty in a US court to claims that he took customer deposits at FTX to fund his other firm, Alameda Research, buy property and make political donations. Two of Mr Bankman-Fried's closest colleagues have already pleaded guilty and are cooperating with the investigation, which has shaken the entire cryptocurrency industry. Mr Bankman-Fried was one of the most high-profile figures in the sector, known for his political ties, celebrity endorsements and bailouts of other struggling firms. He has been accused by the US of building ""a house of cards on a foundation of deception, while telling investors that it was one of the safest buildings in crypto""."
Volatility,£2.8bn shopping centre takeover collapses,2024-09-25,2018-11-29,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46383066,"Shares in the owner of shopping centres including Lakeside and the Trafford Centre have plunged after a £2.8bn takeover bid was abandoned. The consortium bidding for Intu Properties blamed economic uncertainty and market volatility for walking away. It was led by the Peel Group and included Saudi Arabian firm Olayan and Canada's Brookfield Property. Shares in Intu sank 35% to 125p - almost half the 210.4p a share the consortium had offered for the company. David Fischel, chief executive of Intu, said a surge in Brexit-related uncertainty had scuppered the proposal. ""The escalation in the news around Brexit and all the potential ramifications has obviously ramped up a lot in the last couple of weeks and has made it a very hard climate to make a big investment decision,"" he said. John Whittaker, chairman of the Peel Group, which has a 27.3% stake in Intu, said it remained ""fully committed ... as a long-term strategic shareholder"". It is the second time this year Intu has been jilted. In April, Hammerson abandoned a £3.4bn bid.   Intu said it would continue investing in its shopping centres, but would be paying lower dividends to investors in the short term.  The company said it expected full-year growth in net rental income of between zero and 1% assuming there are ""no further material tenant failures"", which it says have hit growth by some 1.5% over the year.  Mr Whittaker said there was a ""key role"" for physical shops despite a spate of recent closures of some of the best-known names in retailing.  Earlier this month, Mike Ashley, whose Sports Direct recently took over House of Fraser, said he would close four of the department store chain's stores in Intu shopping centres after failing to agree rent cuts for the shops.  Other troubled stores include Debenhams (another Mike Ashley investment), New Look and restaurant chains Prezzo and Jamie's Italian.  A recent report by consultants PwC found 14 shops were closing every day as UK high streets face their toughest trading climate in five years. Data from retail analysts Springboard indicated that shoppers were continuing to favour buying online rather than heading out to the shops. Its data for last week's Black Friday event showed the biggest losers were shopping centres.  Footfall at shops was down 7% from a year ago, high streets suffered a 6.4% decline and shopping centres' visitor numbers fell 9.1%."
Volatility,S Korea bans anonymous Bitcoin trades,2024-09-25,2018-01-23,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42784384,"South Korea is banning the use of anonymous bank accounts to make cryptocurrency transactions.  The move is aimed at stopping virtual currencies being used for crimes such as money laundering.  The regulations will bring the country closer into line with financial rules in other markets. South Korea is believed to be the world's third-biggest market for trades in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, behind Japan and the US.  And its importance in the world of digital currency has meant that decisions made in Seoul can result in large, sudden price swings. South Korea considers Bitcoin trading ban How does South Korea sway Bitcoin prices? Bitcoin - risky bubble or the future? The new policy, which had been discussed for some time, will kick in on 30 January.  Holders of anonymous cryptocurrency wallets must now link them to bank accounts in their own name, and have their identities confirmed.  The requirements are similar to the Know Your Customer anti-crime regulations in the US. Separately, underage investors and foreigners will also be banned from opening cryptocurrency accounts in South Korea. And even stricter measures may be introduced later, with officials earlier this month saying a ban on cryptocurrency trading activities was one step being considered. On Monday, Yonhap reported that the country's cryptocurrency exchanges would be hit with hefty tax bills in a separate attempt to rein in the sector.  Trading is popular among the country's younger population and demand has seen a 30% premium put on some virtual trades compared to other countries.  However, volatility around prices together with the lack of regulation surrounding cryptocurrency trading has led to ongoing concerns among South Korean officials that investors are leaving themselves open to potentially huge losses.

Volatility,Should we care about the price of Bitcoin?,2024-09-25,2017-12-21,By Simon Atkinson,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42435995,"On Wednesday, cryptocurrency Bitcoin fell by about 10% to a value of $15,800 (£11,810).   ""It has plunged,"" a colleague said. ""Should we do a story?"" Business journalists (or at least some of them) will debate passionately whether something is indeed a plunge, a dive, or merely a fall, a dip or a retreat. It's what makes us great company at parties. And sure, a 10% movement downwards would usually fall into one of the more dramatic descriptions.  But to give it some perspective, Bitcoin dropping to $15,800 on 20 December took it to its lowest level since, well, 11 December. Which means we are not debating the terminology, but whether or not we should report, blow-by-blow, how Bitcoin is performing at all.    Nobody could accuse the media of ignoring Bitcoin and its rivals, at least not recently. The BBC, like many others, has referred regularly to the skyrocketing price over the past year, including it almost doubling in value over the past month or so. And it seems almost daily there is a legitimate news story: just this week there have been probes about insider trading,Bitcoin crime stories and people asking for Bitcoin as a wedding gift to pick three at random from our website. So there is little doubt cryptocurrencies have entered the mainstream consciousness and news agenda.   Both the currencies, and the technology behind them, seem sure to become more prevalent in the global economy.  The possibilities which that opens up, as well as the risks, is surely worth investigating.  Governments around the world are weighing in with their opinions on regulation. Some well-respected figures have warned that Bitcoin is a bubble that carries a big risk for investors. These seem reasonable things to report, as well as reflecting the more optimistic point of view. Meanwhile the trading of Bitcoin on a huge futures market such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange is also interesting and worth covering, in that it marks a big step towards mainstream investing. But should we be reporting specifically on the price, where the news is essentially: price goes up, price goes down? It is tempting because Bitcoin stories are popular. And some people do clearly want to know.  That list includes investors of course, and anyone wanting to buy, sell or just indulge in one of those ""If only I'd invested five years/five months/five weeks ago"" internal monologues. If that is you, fear not. Plenty of services can tell you what the price of Bitcoin is doing right this second. The BBC tends to use Coindesk as its reference point. There have been occasions when we decided the price was worth marking - most recently, for example, when it crossed the $10,000 threshold. But is choosing not to report on what some see as significant on-the-day price movements a kind of cryptocurrency snobbery?  Well firstly, while we have currency market data pages using information bought from a third party, the BBC does not usually get involved in the nitty-gritty reporting of daily currency market movements.  And if we do write or broadcast about what the dollar, sterling and the euro are up to, it is only when somebody judges it editorially significant.   Sometimes it is when that movement is the result of some other newsworthy event (the sharp fall in the value of sterling after the Brexit referendum springs to mind).  And of course the value of established physical currencies still has far more impact on people's lives - be they running a business, have savings and investments, be going on holiday or indeed buying anything that has been made abroad. So after a bit of a discussion in the BBC's Singapore office, here are few reasons why we feel reluctant to do stories based on the price movements in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency: Incidentally, at the time of writing on Thursday, Bitcoin has bounced back from that ""plunge"" of yesterday to above $17,100. Which is higher than it was 24 hours ago. So no. I don't think we should do a story. "
Volatility,Electricity customers to be consulted on tariffs,2024-09-25,2023-02-22,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-guernsey-64722469,"Electricity customers in Guernsey have been asked about potential tariff changes, due to the ""volatility of the global energy market"". Guernsey Electricity (GE) said it was looking to increase the standing charge by 65%, and put up the price of heating homes using electricity by 13%.  It said it was also asking customers for views on changing the tariffs for people with air source heat pumps.  A two-week consultation has been launched. The company has asked customers for their views because of ""the volatility of the global energy market following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022."" One proposal set out in the consultation is an increase in the customers' standing charge, from £30 to £49.50. Another is to freeze the price people can sell electricity generated at their homes home back to the grid at 9.9p pKWH.  Chief financial officer Karl Brouard said: ""Although local customers have been relatively insulated from the types of rises seen in the UK as a result of our forward price setting strategy, we are not immune from the wider geopolitical impact."" ""We realise that this comes at a time when the cost of living for everyone is increasing, but we cannot let these changes delay the planned investment in the network and the need to maintain the security of electricity supply."" Mr Brouard added the island was ""facing increases in the cost of imported energy, together with a rise in the cost of on-island generation at the power station"". The results of the consultation will feed into the final tariff application made to the States Trading Supervisory Board (STSB), which has the responsibility to assess and approve tariffs. Last year, the STSB approved an application to allow GE to increase its tariffs to raise revenue by 9%.  The Environment and Infrastructure Committee said a new electricity strategy was to be debated before the end of March 2023, having previously said it would be in December 2022.  Committee president Lindsay de Sausmarez said work was ""progressing well"" on the strategy, with an aim to publish a policy letter on it ""by the end of March 2023"".

Volatility,Holyrood Budget: growing pains,2024-09-25,2017-12-15,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-42363801,"A good budget requires a rabbit to be pulled from the finance minister's hat. That's ""good"" in the journalist's sense that it's at least interesting. As a financial magician, Derek Mackay still has plodding patter. Last year's budget speech from the finance secretary, likened to a pupil reading a lesson at the school carol service but only under protest, had improved to the point of sounding a bit like Jackanory. But when he reached into his hat of magic tricks to give his budget a bit of wizardry, it seemed as if said rodents had been breeding. Like rabbits. Not one new tax band, but two. A rate hike here, a cut there, contriving to make Scotland both the highest and lowest taxed part of the UK. By the time he sat down, Mr Mackay's bunnies were hopping all over Holyrood and beyond, their whiskers twitching at the prospect of some green shoots for a nibble.  Unfortunately, those are the frosty winter shoots on which an economic recovery depends. At first glance, this looked a politically astute budget. Going further than expected for the NHS. A raft of measures to please the business lobbyists. A big wad for rural broadband.  Most of those who speak for business were willing to welcome most measures, particularly on business rates. The tourist sector was particularly positive about both business rates being linked to a lower inflation index, and broadband reaching hotels on the periphery. Housebuilders like the business rate changes too, and a small cut to the Land and Buildings Transaction Tax levied on first time buyers. But the rest of the property sector was disappointed there wasn't more change to the LBTT, which has put a dampener on things towards the upper end of the market. Engineering Scotland liked the look of more research funding. The Scottish National Investment Bank is seen positively. The Federation of Small Businesses saw some positives, but remarked that it had sought ""ballast in choppy markets, but instead the Scottish government steered into uncharted economic waters"". Experts and analysts have more doubts than business. Reform Scotland, the think tank, thinks the tax cuts bring unnecessary risk and could lead to lower revenue.   IPPR Scotland reckons a lot of the tax cut on low earners will go to second, part-time earners in better off households, who may not be the most deserving. The Chartered Institute of Taxation noted the potential for some anomalies, as the new starter rate becomes entangled with the tapering of Westminster's benefits system. Hargreaves Lansdowne, the wealth managers, note that tax relief on pensions may now require a lot more paperwork. Politically, the tax reform showed Scotland can go its own way, without necessarily frightening the horses. With a bit of take and give, the reform is expected to bring in an extra £164m - merely 1.3% up on an income tax take of nearly £12bn. It had most of what will be needed to win over the Scottish Green MSPs with whom Mr Mackay hopes to get his budget over the line at Holyrood. But economically, the seismic change to Scotland's income tax is likely to overshadow one very small, very significant number that wasn't even in the budget speech: 0.7%. That's the amount by which the Scottish Fiscal Commission (SFC) expects the economy to grow next year.   For three years after that, growth is forecast to remain below 1%. Way off in 2022, it rises to the unimpressive heights of 1.1%. The UK growth forecast, from the Office for Budget Responsibility, was the main, unwelcome surprise of Phillip Hammond's November budget. Conceding it had been over-optimistic about Britain's return to productivity growth, it adjusted to the reality of very slow improvements. That delivered a growth forecast for next year of a dismal 1.4%. So using parallel assumptions about Scotland's productivity, which has been going backwards of late, the SFC forecasts a growth rate of only half as much. Some of that gap can be explained by faster population growth south of the Border, but not all.  In a cautiously worded document from the SFC, the warnings are stark: ""The growth that has been achieved in recent years has been driven by factors which include a boom in the construction industry, strong labour market growth, a falling savings ration and support form the oil and gas industry. These factors are unlikely to continue to support growth to the same extent in the coming years. ""Future downside risks include the UK's changing relationship with the EU, a weakening outlook for global trade, Scotland's industrial and demographic structure and weak onshore demand linked to activity in the oil and gas sector."" On earnings, it's starker still: ""Real household disposable income [that's the useful stuff that matters, including tax and benefits] is not expected to see any growth until 2020-21 because of a combination of slow wage growth, very limited employment growth and inflation"". And much of this has to do with productivity being so weak, having ""a profound impact on GDP and the Scottish economy as a whole"". This downgrade in growth forecast is measurable when compared with the Scottish government's forecast last February. Things have taken such a downward lurch that the increase in tax rates is wiped out by the reduction in tax revenue. Next year, Derek Mackay's income tax changes are expected to add £164m to the total revenue, yet total revenue is down more than £200m on expectations in February. That gap widens rapidly over subsequent years. By 2021-22, contrasting February's estimate with this month's figures adds £188m from the change to tax bands and rates, yet the total tax take is down by more than £900m - from £14.59bn to £13.66bn. Welcome to the world of tax revenue volatility, or what they sometimes like to call buoyancy. It's an exciting new world for MSPs, but forces them to think much harder about the ways in which growth can be increased. One last question that puzzled me about Derek Mackay's speech. Was this tax rise a one-off or not? Taxpayers who are being asked to pay more might well be willing to accept such incremental change this year, but probably want to know the big picture and the further horizon.  Will higher earners still be paying to counter Westminster's spending squeeze - which is expected to last into the mid-2020s - with further, unending tax hikes?"
Volatility,Universities warn of going bust without extra cash,2024-09-25,2020-04-09,By Sean Coughlan,https://www.bbc.com/news/education-52237664,"Universities across the UK are calling for emergency funding of at least £2bn, warning some institutions will go bust without it. Universities UK says the coronavirus pandemic is threatening to sharply cut overseas student numbers and put universities in financial danger. They are asking for controls on student numbers in each university, to keep fee income at similar levels to last year. Universities are promising to honour any offers already made to students. ""Without government support, some universities would face financial failure, others would come close to financial failure and be forced to reduce provision,"" says a letter from higher education leaders to ministers across the UK. Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK, says the proposals would help universities to ""weather the very serious financial challenges posed by Covid-19"". He says academic researchers have made a ""huge contribution"" to tackling the coronavirus pandemic - and their expertise will be needed in the ""recovery of the economy and communities following the crisis"".  They are calling for an extra £2bn in research funding and on top of that to provide emergency loans for universities that faced ""significant income losses"". ""Targeted support"" should be available to protect strategically important subjects such as science and medicine, say the industry leaders. This would be in response to cash pressures from the pandemic: There have been warnings of unprecedented ""volatility"" in this year's admissions - which, if left unchecked, could see some universities expanding but others left with too few students to be financially viable. This is a particular risk for universities in England and Wales, which are highly dependent on tuition fee income. In response, Universities UK is asking for controls on the number of students each university in England and Wales can recruit this year, keeping them to levels expected before the coronavirus outbreak, to stop financially unsustainable swings in numbers. The scale of concern was suggested in an internal email from a Russell Group university seen by the BBC this week, which warned the university could lose a quarter of its income next year. The letter from Universities UK to ministers says that to provide ""stability"" for students currently applying, all offers already made would have to be honoured if students made the required grade. There is also a call to push back by a year the point at which European Union students are categorised as overseas students, when they will face higher fees and visa restrictions. Jo Grady of the UCU lecturers' union said the plan was a ""piecemeal approach that fails to recognise the size of the problem, or the damage we risk doing to our academic capacity"". Eva Crossan Jory, vice president of the National Union of Students, said any extra funding must support students, ""especially considering the mounting discontent that courses are not being delivered as promised and demands for refunds"". She backed calls for the government to ""step in"" to protect higher education, but said it should include ""refunding or all or part of the fees"". ""The scale of the financial challenges facing higher education institutions are clearly very serious"", said Scotland's Deputy First Minister John Swinney. He promised to work closely with universities to help them ""emerge from this crisis"". A Welsh government spokesman said universities had been ""at the forefront of the battle against the coronavirus"" and ministers would work to ensure they had the ""necessary investment"". In England, a Department for Education spokeswoman said: ""The outbreak poses significant challenges to the sector and the government is working closely with universities to understand the financial risks and implications they might face at this uncertain time."""
Volatility,Firm banks on carbon fibre bikes in Europe,2024-09-25,2022-05-05,By Pedro Garcia,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-61082317,"There is growing demand from amateur cyclists for more affordable, carbon fibre bike frames.   The material is light and strong, and among other things enthusiasts hope it will improve their speed.  In Portugal, Carbon Team and its investors are betting on this appetite for high-end bikes growing in Europe. Located in Campia (not far from Oliveira de Frades, a town famous for bikes), a group of investors from Portugal, Germany, and Taiwan launched the firm in 2018. The company believe manufacturing of hi-tech bicycle components is poised to return to Europe, after decades of supply from firms in China and Taiwan. Emre Ozgunes joined Carbon Team in 2019, hired as a general manager for the new company after years of experience in the Portuguese bike sector.  Originally from Turkey, he worked as a factory floor employee in a bicycle company in central Portugal, where he learned the trade.  ""I always yearned to start a business from scratch"", Mr Ozgunes tells the BBC.  The investors put €8.4m (£7m; $9.2m) into Carbon Team and after three years of product development, production started last year.  Just three people staffed that first production line: Mr Ozgunes, Miguel Oliveira, the company's production manager, and Filipa Antunes, now technical manager.  By March of this year output had increased - with 30 employees constructing between 8 and 10 frames per day. Mr Ozgunes hopes that by 2023 they will have almost 200 people on Carbon Team's payroll, making up to 150 frames per day.  Although it's a long way off, expansion to this size would make Carbon Team the only company in Europe to mass produce carbon fibre frames. Almost all the frames will be exported. If demand really takes off, there is land available behind the factory where they could build an additional unit and double maximum capacity to 110,000 frames per year. There is a wider trend gaining popularity among European industries to relocate key elements of their supply chain closer to home, limiting their dependency on Asian suppliers for parts and raw materials. The Covid-19 pandemic accelerated this trend. Freight prices skyrocketed and lockdowns forced many Asian factories to sporadically suspend their production.  The Confederation of the European Bicycle Industry (Conebi) estimates that among all bicycles sold in Europe, 40% of their parts are made on the continent, rising to more than half for electric bikes. ""This is positive, but there is still the need to have more production of components in Europe,"" says Manuel Marsilio, general manager of Conebi. ""The supply chain disruptions in the bicycle industry have boosted discussions that started already before the pandemic. Making components closer to where bicycles and e-bikes are assembled has many advantages and the industry is likely to go in that direction,"" he adds.   The industry is currently debating how to speed-up this shift - but it will be a slow transition.  The latest Global Bike & Bike Accessories Market report by consultancy firm, PwC, shows that over half of European bicycle manufacturers buy their frames on the international markets. Marta Baldin, from PwC's Italian branch and co-author of the study, tells the BBC, that ""in the near future, supply from overseas is not expected to decrease or slow down. It is expected that the biggest concentration of imports will still come from Asian markets"". More technology of business: Analysts suggest the biggest opportunity for European firms lies at the higher end of the market. ""On quality and innovation, EU producers do not suffer from foreign competition and this is the main reason why niche and high-quality bike products are still manufactured in the EU,"" she adds. And as wages rise for factory workers in Asia, buying from that region is losing some of its economic advantage. Meanwhile, freight costs are increasingly prohibitive, points out Mr Ozgunes.  Volatility on international commodities markets is also helping Carbon Team at the moment. The price of aluminium, for instance, traditionally the cheaper alternative to carbon fibre, soared to record levels in March before moving lower.  Although carbon fibre prices have risen as well, the increase is currently nowhere near the rise in aluminium prices. This inflationary trend will likely have an impact on the price of mid-range bicycles too, according to Mr Ozgunes. On the factory floor, Carbon Team's employees focus silently on their tasks, all demanding precision. A group of employees applies carbon fibre to moulds. Others, on separate tables, prepare and test the raw material. In a separate aisle, four large ovens bake the final product, while recently made frames are tested for quality and safety. Filipa Antunes, Carbon Team's technical manager, joined in February 2020, one month before the onset of the pandemic.  ""Demand for two-wheeled vehicles rose exponentially with the pandemic and luckily many companies built up their capacity,"" she says. She is optimistic and thinks the proposed expansion promises a bright future for her and her company."
Volatility,Stock markets and pound rise ahead of Brexit deal,2024-09-25,2020-12-24,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-55433657,"UK stock markets have closed for the Christmas break in an upbeat mood. The FTSE 250 jumped 1.15% to 20,531, hours before the Brexit trade deal with the EU was announced. But the blue-chip FTSE 100 ended the day's trading up just 0.01% at 6,502 as traders waited for confirmation of the deal to emerge. Market positivity will give a seasonal boost to investors, including the millions who have a financial stake in stock markets through their pensions. The pound was up, showing a gain of about 0.7% against the dollar to touch $1.36 before falling back slightly. It also gained 0.5% against the euro, rising to €1.1136. Across Europe, shares were also on the rise, although the key Frankfurt stock market was closed. Asian markets closed positively with Japan's Nikkei gaining 0.54%, while markets in Australia, South Korea and Singapore also saw modest rises. Sterling has always been the most reliable of Brexit trade deal sentiment - the pound rose against the US dollar yesterday and continued that rise this morning.  It started the week worth $1.34, dropped to $1.32 as hopes of a deal faded, and this morning climbed to $1.36.  The stock market reaction today has been muted - the FTSE 100 was barely changed this morning, but much of the reaction to the looming deal took place yesterday.  The FTSE 250, a stock market index that is regarded as more representative of the UK economy, climbed nearly 2% on Wednesday.  Lloyds Bank, which investors have come to see as a bellwether of sentiment towards a trade deal, rose 7% yesterday and another 6% this morning. An agreement on fishing rights has been the main stumbling block of the trade talks as an end-of-year deadline looms. The pound has seen plenty of volatility in recent weeks as negotiations between UK and European ministers have stalled and deadlines missed. Last week, it had hit a two-year high above $1.36. The British currency had surged almost 1% in the previous session to snap a three-day losing streak in what has been a roller-coaster ride. ""Sentiment improved after headlines started appearing that the United Kingdom and European Union have finally reached a provisional Brexit trade agreement."" said Jeffrey Halley at foreign exchange firm Oanda. If your reaction to ""market movements"" is that you are not directly affected because you do not invest money, think again. You are likely to be one of the millions of people with a pension - either privately or through work - who have their savings invested by pension schemes. As much as £600bn is held in defined contribution pensions at the moment. Pension savers mostly let experts choose where to invest their money to help it grow. But that means the value of your savings pot is influenced by the performance of the investments. So rises or falls in shares can affect your pension and effectively your savings, which is why you are affected by major market movements. However, it's worth bearing in mind that pension savings, like any investments, are usually a long-term bet, so short-term market fluctuations are not something to panic about. ""There's a huge difference between knowing you're connected to the stock market and panicking about it,"" says Sarah Coles from investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown.  ""Stock markets always go up and down over the short term,"" she adds. ""It's important to bear in mind that investors have lived through major ups and downs in the past and come out the other side."""
Volatility,Irn Bru sales up as new recipe introduced,2024-09-25,2018-03-27,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-43555306,"The maker of Irn Bru has reported its sharpest annual rise in sales of the soft drink, up by 8%. AG Barr issued its figures for the year to January with strong results also for its Rubicon fruit drink brand, up 5%, and Funkin mixers, up 25%. The firm cited an increase in market share, and moving most of its products out of the reach of the new sugar levy. Next week the UK government will begin to tax soft drinks with more than five grams of sugar per 100 millilitres.  By reformulating its drinks with less sugar, AG Barr says 99% of products will not be affected by the levy, which is aimed at improving health. The Lanarkshire-based company has also announced a new strategic partnership with Bundaberg, the family-owned Australian firm best known for its ginger beer. AG Barr reported a more modest 4% growth to international sales. One reason for the rise in Irn Bru sales was a boost to its plastic bottling capacity at the new Milton Keynes plant. It has also sought to align its marketing with the growth in ""food-to-go"" in retail chains such as Greggs. Newly-launched Irn Bru Xtra sold the equivalent of 60 million cans during the year - a third of the figure for Irn Bru Sugar Free. Rubicon Spring water, another new product, sold 17 million bottles. Overall, revenue in the year to January 27 was up 8% to £278m, while pre-tax profits rose 4% to £45m. Roger White, chief executive of AG Barr said the firm has delivered ""consistent broad-based sales growth across our portfolio, well ahead of the soft drinks market  performance throughout the year, supported by successful innovation, strong core brands, and further development of our partnership"". He added: ""The UK economy is likely to expected to remain uncertain for business as a whole, with regulation, changing customer dynamics and consumer preferences adding further volatility for the soft drinks industry."""
Volatility,Would you want to get paid in Bitcoin?,2024-09-25,2017-12-27,By Ashleigh Nghiem,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42435838,"Bitcoin. Lots of people are talking about, but very few own it.  So how would you feel about getting paid in the high profile cryptocurrency?  From early next year, staff at Japanese internet firm GMO Group will be among the latest to find out how that feels. More than 4,000 employees are being given the option to receive a portion of their salary in Bitcoin. Critics say it is a marketing stunt, announced at a time when global interest in the financial technology has never been higher.  It also carries risks: the volatile currency slumped last week but has since rebounded by more than 50%. But what will it really mean for employer and employee? Bitcoin salaries are usually paid according to the digital currency's value at an agreed date and time. To keep the numbers simple, if the Bitcoin price was $10,000 and an employee opted to have $1,000 in the digital currency, they would receive 0.1 Bitcoin.  Employees who choose to sell right away would receive the same in cash as they would have been paid (so long as they had arranged for the sale to happen in advance).  But holding onto the cryptocurrency, be it for a day, a week or a year, would see its value go up or go down. That $1,000 may end up being worth $5,000. Or potentially next to nothing. And so some argue that paying wages in Bitcoin effectively encourages people to gamble. ""If an employee is receiving their salary in Bitcoin, they might as well be receiving lottery tickets"", said Massimo Massa, professor of finance at INSEAD. ""They are just participating in a game."" Staff must be made aware that ""there's no guarantee that its price will rise and there's no intrinsic value because there's nothing to back it up"", he said, adding such schemes could never be compulsory. Despite repeated warnings from renowned economists and analysts that a Bitcoin crash is looming, it seems more of us are willing to take a punt. Bitwage, a platform set up to convert salaries into cryptocurrency, gained thousands of new users this year as people got swept up in some rapid price rises. ""These days a lot of people are looking to get part, and sometimes all of their salary paid in Bitcoin"", said Bitwage founder Jonathan Chester. The company has this year processed $30m in wages for 20,000 users in the US, Europe, Latin America and Asia including staff from Google, Facebook, GE, Philips, the United Nations and the US Navy. Many of these workers had signed up for the service on their own. Mr Chester said he converts 15% of his own monthly salary and believes it is ""a way of accumulating Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies without worrying about whether you're buying at the right time"".    That is because people can theoretically reduce the risks of volatility because they ""only buy little bits over time"". It is a tricky one to generalise, and it seems inevitable that as the industry develops, so too will the tax rules. Wherever they are in the world, employees will usually be liable for income tax due on their Bitcoin wages, calculated on its value at the time the salary is paid. But just like with stock options, employees may need to pay capital gains tax if their Bitcoin has risen in value, depending on the tax jurisdiction. Some companies working in the cryptocurrency industry have been offering Bitcoin salaries for years.  After all, if you got in early and bought when the price was much lower, then it could be a smart move to use it now to pay wages.  But for others it is all about business strategy. Japan's GMO, for example, says it wants to get staff thinking about cryptocurrencies. It has recently expanded into cryptocurrency trading and crypto mining. And so it hopes that if at least some employees have direct personal experience of Bitcoin, it will help with ""nurturing and developing cryptocurrency literacy"". And that, it says is ""vital to the growth and expansion of our cryptocurrency business"". The digital payment industry is expanding, with new digital currencies emerging all the time.   At the Singapore based blockchain company TenX, staff usually have their base salary paid into their bank accounts, but their monthly bonus is paid in Pay tokens, the firm's own digital currency. The tokens, which can be traded on digital exchanges, were issued in an initial coin offering in June, allowing the company to raise $80m. TenX co-founder and president, Julian Hosp, said it did not make sense to buy Bitcoin to pay bonuses when the company already had its own currency. Paying bonuses in tokens can incentivises staff as Pay's value should rise in line with the company's success, Mr Hosp added. TenX community manager, Mike Ferrer, has gone further and opted to receive part of his base salary in Pay, on top of his monthly bonus. The 32-year-old has been investing in cryptocurrencies for some time, and accepts that there are huge risks, but says he only invests what he can afford. ""I visualise myself throwing in a pile of money and watching it burn in front of me, and if I can't feel comfortable with that then I know I've over invested"", Mr Ferrer said."
Volatility,Business output grows further as restrictions ease,2024-09-25,2021-07-12,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-57779997,"Looser Covid restrictions helped boost Scottish private sector output to near record levels last month, according to a report. A regular RBS survey of purchasing managers found a steep rise in new business, with firms hiring more staff for the third month in a row. ""Improved client confidence"" was among other reasons cited for the upturn. The rate of output growth was slower than May's, but was still the second quickest since September 2013. The survey follows a separate RBS report on jobs, which found hiring activity at Scottish businesses continued to surge last month, amid easing Covid-19 restrictions and rising economic activity. The bank's latest PMI index - which measures combined manufacturing and service sector output - posted 58.4 in June, falling from May's survey record of 61.5.  Any figure above 50 suggests economic expansion. The survey indicated that the latest increase in new business was broad-based and led by services, with goods producers seeing growth slow on the month. Meanwhile, input prices faced by private sector firms continued to soar during June, with the rate of inflation the fastest since February 2011.  Panellists attributed greater costs to material shortages, price hikes at suppliers, Brexit and higher fuel and utilities prices. In response, Scottish private sector firms increased their average charges for the eighth month running. According to the survey, companies remained optimistic about activity over the coming year.  That confidence was linked to looser lockdown restrictions and the subsequent reopening of some sectors, as well as ""surging inflows"" of new work and hopes of a strong economic recovery. RBS Scotland board chairman Malcolm Buchanan said the June data showed ""some signs of optimism"" for the Scottish firms. ""The rates of increase in both business activity and new work slowed only slightly from May's respective series records and remained marked,"" he said. ""Inflationary pressures are a key concern, however, as material shortages and greater fuel and utilities fees continued to put severe upward pressure on input costs and, subsequently, selling prices."" In a separate development, Scotland's public spending watchdog has warned of ""acute and unpredictable"" financial pressures that will require co-operation between Scottish and UK governments.  Scotland's auditor general Stephen Boyle said in a blog on Friday that the response to Covid had made finances more complex than ever, and managing volatility would be difficult.  He warned that the £4.6bn committed to Covid spending for this year was not guaranteed by the UK government and could be increased or reduced. Mr Boyle said there was a need for effective communication and co-operation between Downing Street and Holyrood.  He added that acute and unpredictable financial pressures did not only come from the public health crisis, but from backlogs in the NHS and courts."
Volatility,Oil price rises due to fears over Russian shortfall,2024-09-25,2022-03-09,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60680787,"Oil prices rose on Thursday amid confusion over whether major producers would help to plug a gap in supplies from Russia. The United Arab Emirates had appeared to push members of the Opec producer group to raise output, only for the UAE's energy minister to quash hopes. The oil price rose more than 5%, after a 17% fall on Wednesday. ""To suggest the oil market is confused would be an understatement,"" said analyst Stephen Innes. US President Joe Biden and other leaders have pledged to try to ease the price pressures for households. Officials from the US have been in talks with oil producers aimed at boosting supply. ""We favour production increases and will be encouraging Opec to consider higher production levels,"" Ambassador Yousuf Al Otaiba said in a statement tweeted by the UAE Embassy in Washington. But the energy minister Minister Suhail al-Mazrouei said later that the Gulf state remained committed to the existing Opec monthly output agreement, which fixes how much crude is produced by member countries. Oil prices have jumped more than 30% since 24 February, touching $139 (£105) a barrel at one point this week.  The oil price had fallen back to about $106 a barrel at one point on Wednesday, but by Thursday morning it was trading at around $116. On Tuesday, German Economy Minister Robert Habeck issued an ""urgent appeal"" to Opec oil producers to increase output ""to create relief on the market"". Saudi Arabia-led Opec and an extended group of oil producers called Opec+ - which includes Russia - have agreed to avoid a price war and keep control over the market. Mr Innes, managing partner of SPI Asset Management, said: ""To suggest the oil market is confused would be an understatement as we are in an unprecedented situation."" Commonwealth Bank commodities analyst Vivek Dhar said: ""We think it will be challenging for Opec+ to boost production in this environment.""  Worries about oil and gas supplies have led to soaring domestic heating bills and fuel prices at the pump. Both petrol and diesel prices hit new records in the UK on Wednesday, according to the RAC motoring group. Unleaded petrol was 159.57p a litre on average, while diesel was 167.37p.  By Sameer Hashmi, Middle East business correspondent Despite the mixed messages coming out from the UAE, there is a broad consensus within Opec+ that there is no immediate need to boost oil production faster. So, even if the UAE tries to convince other members to increase production during the next meeting, it will be difficult to find many backers.  While Abu Dhabi is a prominent member of Opec+, Riyadh and Moscow are the leaders of the pack and they are the ones who call the shots. Any decision to increase supplies will essentially boil down to Saudi Arabia. While the UAE is keen to increase production, it is very unlikely that it will break ranks and pump more oil unilaterally.  Both the Saudis and the Emiratis have maintained a neutral stance during the course of this war, and the former would be unwilling to take any decision related to Opec+ that the Russians would oppose. Opec+ has attributed the recent rise in prices to market volatility caused by geopolitical tensions and maintained that there is no shortage of supplies in the market. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: ""A tank of petrol is now almost £88 while diesel has now gone over £92. Diesel unfortunately appears to be on a clear path to £1.70 a litre. ""As this is an average price, drivers will be seeing some unbelievably high prices on forecourts as retailers pass on their increased wholesale costs."" Energy prices have been soaring for more than a year amid a rapid rebound in demand for oil, which had collapsed during the pandemic. Russia's invasion of Ukraine added new price pressures, as sanctions make it hard for the country - typically the producer of about 7% of global supplies -  to find buyers for its oil.  The US and Canada have also announced bans on Russian oil imports, while the UK said it would phase them out by the end of the year. The International Energy Agency (IEA) recently agreed to release 60 million barrels of oil from strategic national reserves, but that move is not enough to respond to the recent run-up in prices. The agency said on Wednesday that oil reserves may be tapped further. ""If there's a need, if our governments decide so, we can bring more oil to the markets, as one part of the response,"" said IEA chief Faith Birol."
Volatility,How Bitcoin is infiltrating the $60bn global art market,2024-09-25,2017-07-24,By Matthew Wall,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-40703182,"Why is the art world getting excited about digital currency Bitcoin and its underlying technology blockchain? Eleesa Dadiani owns and runs an art gallery in London's famous Cork Street. She was born in Georgia in the Caucasus and was ""breastfed by gypsies"". But she is also a passionate believer in the power of Bitcoin and other digital currencies. When we meet she is busy preparing for an exhibition of sculptures made from the exhausts of former Formula 1 racing cars. One of these strange rib-cage-like creations made from the super-strong alloy inconel has been gold-plated and will sell for about £35,000. ""These are pieces of history,"" she tells me. In a first for the tradition-bound art world of Cork Street, her international clientele will have the opportunity to pay using Bitcoin, the digital cryptocurrency underpinned by blockchain technology. The gallery will also accept other cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, Dash, Litecoin, and soon, Monero, she says. Why? ""This is not a demand-driven decision at all, it's intuitive based on the way things are going,"" she says. She believes paying by cryptocurrency will become as normal as paying by cash or credit card. She also hopes it will attract a new, non-traditional type of art investor. Blockchain, the underlying technology, is a digital ledger or record of transactions that is distributed across, and verified by, thousands of computers in a network. Once the network has reached a consensus that a transaction has happened, the ledger is updated and cannot be tampered with.    ""Blockchain is a borderless, open source, decentralised peer-to-peer network that governments cannot shut down,"" she says. ""For me, the blockchain is going to be the biggest thing since the internet."" And the fact that there is no centralised body - like a bank head office, for example - makes cryptocurrencies safer, she argues, despite their reputation for being volatile, high-risk and the favourite ""store of value"" for criminals and hackers.  Bitcoin payments can be anonymous and potentially beyond the grasp of tax authorities, but this isn't the reason she's offering payment by cryptocurrency, she assures me.  So how easy is it to accept a Bitcoin payment? ""It's really very simple,"" she explains. ""I give the client my public key [a long string of letters and numbers] and they use that to send bitcoin to my account from their digital wallet or bitcoin exchange,"" she says.  ""My wallet is linked to my personal bank so I can then convert those bitcoins into pounds, euros or dollars.""  Ms Dadiani is such a fan of cryptocurrencies - she trades in them as well - that she is launching her own version, Dadicoin, later this year. The $60bn art world in general is warming to the potential of cryptocurrencies, partly because of blockchain's dual ability to establish the provenance of works of art and thereby reduce the reliance on brokers and other middlemen. Marcelo Garcia Casil, for example, is chief executive and co-founder of Maecenas, an online marketplace that will enable art owners to sell shares in their expensive works of art (worth more than $1m) and raise money far more cheaply than they could though a bank. And the owners also get to keep possession of their artworks while sharing up to 49% of the ownership. Investors, who ordinarily wouldn't be able to afford multi-million-dollar works of art, will be able buy shares or units in the work using cryptocurrency. They will then be able to sell these units later in the marketplace. Each transaction is recorded cryptographically on the Ethereum blockchain. ""We want to make fine art accessible for everyone,"" says Mr Casil, who was born in Argentina, now lives in Singapore, and has a background in investment banking.  ""The old auction houses like Christie's and Sotheby's have controlled the art market for centuries, so we think the opportunity for disruption is huge."" Establishing the authenticity of works of art is critical to their value, and this will still need to be done by skilled professionals, admits Mr Casil. ""But once the provenance has been recorded in the blockchain, you never have to do it again,"" he says. This takes a lot of cost out of the system. Maecenas has already attracted works of art worth $100m (£77m; 86m euros) in total, says Mr Casil, and the marketplace is due for launch in September. The art world has been flirting with Bitcoin for a few years now, despite the likes of auction house Sotheby's saying they have no plans to accept the currency. In April 2015, the Austrian Museum of Applied Art/Contemporary Art (MAK) was the first museum in the world to buy a work of art using Bitcoin. Dutch artist Harm van den Dorpel created a limited-edition screensaver that was cryptographically authenticated through blockchain. And online gallery Cointemporary exhibits digital artworks by international contemporary artists that can only be bought with Bitcoin. Purchases are handled by Coinbase, a leading cryptocurrency exchange. Blockchain establishes the chain of ownership, preventing anyone from stealing or tampering with the work. But will Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies ever really become a mainstream alternative to traditional money? Views differ widely. In Japan, there is a big move to equip 260,000 retail locations with bitcoin capability, and a few high-street retailers, such as Lush, have opted to accept the currency. But Joe Pindar, a director at cyber-security company Gemalto, says: ""At present there are very few businesses accepting bitcoin as a payment method - less than 1% of all retailers.  ""The biggest barrier to adoption is the length of time it takes to settle a payment in person, with transactions taking tens of minutes.  Despite this, Mr Pindar says several large retailers have been experimenting with the cryptocurrency, but may choose ""to adopt bitcoin for online purchases only, where time to process a payment is less important."" The currency's volatility is an issue - the value of one bitcoin topped $3,000 in June, before crashing to below $1,900 in July - and transactions are taking longer and longer to process.  This is largely to do with the rules governing how Bitcoin works, and there is currently a big row over how the issue should be resolved. It could be that blockchain proves to be more important to the art world than its flashier Bitcoin offspring."
Volatility,Amazon staff told to work overtime as virus hits,2024-09-25,2020-03-17,By Lora Jones,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51921916,"Workers at Amazon's UK warehouses are being told to work overtime to tackle huge demand due to the coronavirus pandemic, despite government calls to restrict social contact. The GMB union says that workers across at least four different sites were informed that they had to work ""compulsory overtime"" from Monday. National officer Mick Rix said Amazon had put ""profit before safety"". Amazon said it was working to ensure it can continue to deliver to customers.  Compulsory overtime means that some employees must work additional hours as requested by an employer - if their contract says so. Amazon employs 27,000 people in the UK and has 17 warehouses.  One worker at Amazon's Dunfermline warehouse in Scotland, who asked not to be named, told the BBC that staff in the ""inbound goods"" department are having additional hours imposed.  The worker, who thinks they have a compulsory overtime clause in their contract, believes this will be for at least two weeks. They said that there is extra pressure on the workforce to deal with an influx of goods the company is bringing in due to a spike in demand.  Sought-after items include bleach, handwash, nappies, large boxes of rice and powdered milk. The worker added that these actions were ""very rare"" outside of the Christmas trading period or Amazon ""Prime week"", where the firm offers discounts on goods for subscribers. The worker said other departments in the Dunfermline warehouse are not saying staff should do more hours, but offering them up to 60 hours of voluntary overtime. An Amazon spokesperson confirmed that the company had ramped up shifts across the UK. They said: ""As demand continues to increase, we are working to ensure we can continue to deliver to the most-impacted customers while keeping our people safe"". ""Many of these customers have no other way to get essential items and we want to be sure that we have the right resources in place to deliver on their needs.  ""Starting this week, we'll be prioritising the intake and dispatch of items most needed by our customers right now. These are items such as food, health and personal care products, items needed to work from home, books and toys for children."" Amazon also said that there is an exemptions process in place for employees who cannot work additional hours for personal reasons, such as caring responsibilities. On Monday, Boris Johnson said people should work from home where possible as part of a range of stringent new measures to stop the spread of coronavirus. The GMB union's national officer Mick Rix called the overtime reports ""extremely concerning"", and accused Amazon of ""imposing its demands on workers without any regard for their safety"". Mr Rix said he was concerned that if staff are overworked, stress will make them more susceptible to the Covid-19 virus. Sarah Evans, employment law partner at JMW solicitors, said that if a worker's contract has a clause in it that says there ""may be an element of compulsory overtime"", then a boss is entitled to use it to make them do additional hours. She pointed out that under Working Time Regulations in the UK, overtime is limited to a maximum of 48 hours per week, averaged over a 17-week period.  Workers can ""opt out"" of the maximum weekly limit, however, and some are required to do so as a condition of employment.  Hannah Ford, a partner and employment law expert at Stevens & Bolton, said that these were ""unprecedented times, but all employers must operate within the law."" She added: ""All employers also owe an implied duty to take reasonable care for the health and safety of its employees... this extends to mental health as well as physical health."" Workers in the US have also been posting on social media about working overtime at Amazon fulfilment centres. Amazon has said it will hire 100,000 warehouse and delivery workers in the United States to deal with the surge in sales due to pandemic. The online retail giant also said it would increase pay for its staff in the UK, US and Europe. Amazon said it would increase hourly wages by $2 in the US, £2 in the UK, and €2 in Europe. The company said it expects the pay rises expected to cost it more than $350m (£285m)."
Volatility,Living with mum and dad at 30,2024-09-25,2018-05-25,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-44236706,"The story of the US couple successfully winning the right to evict their 30-year-old son from their home, has prompted a number of 30-somethings to get in touch with the BBC about their experiences of living with their parents. Reasons for staying at home range from the culturally acceptable to the financial. Here, people in their 30s describe their current living arrangements with mum and dad. ""I have lived my whole life in Calgary, an oil and gas-based city. I saw an abundance of oil and gas jobs in the industry growing up, and becoming a petroleum geologist seemed like a natural course to take. ""I was thrilled when I got my first permanent job at a small oil company, and later I had saved enough money for a down payment on a small townhouse.  ""But in July 2016 the company I worked for declared bankruptcy as the price of oil fell. I received no severance but I was able to sell my townhouse (at a loss) right before the company went under.  ""My parents and I have always had a good relationship and they were gracious enough to let me move back in with them. They recognise and understand the issues young Canadians encounter.  ""A lot of my friends are in the same position and understand the situation I am in. If anything, it's me who is putting pressure on myself to leave home. ""There is still considerable volatility in my employment and in the Canadian oil and gas industry. I am not confident in moving forward and purchasing or renting a new place. ""I would now consider myself in a place of 'precarious employment'.  I have no employment insurance, no health or dental coverage. I am not alone in my career uncertainty. I feel I have done everything right, but I still feel anxiety towards the future of my career.  ""Right now, 'leaving the nest' is just not a financially wise decision."" ""Tuition fees were introduced at the time I was applying for university so I couldn't afford to go away from home to study.  ""I stayed home and studied at the Open University whilst juggling a business and part-time jobs to pay for tuition, business expenses, transport, domestic contributions and saving for a house deposit.  ""By the time I graduated from the four-year degree and teaching qualification, house prices in my area had quadrupled - £45,000 starter homes went up to £180,000, and I have been priced out ever since.  ""It was devastating - if I got a full-time job at 16 and saved I would have been able to buy a house! ""I think my chance of buying my own home has probably gone. I tried to get a good education, but when I worked it out, I was worse off having gone to university."" You may also like: US parents win battle to evict son, 30 Single, 30 and time to leave home?

But because of the 'Bank of Mum and Dad' who helped her out, things were never the same between us. ""You do feel cut off from people because you feel you become different from them. It can be isolating. ""I've kind of given up now. When I was around 30, I wanted to move out but you get to the point that it's not worth it. I could probably get a deposit together but my wages are not enough to pay for a mortgage.  ""In some ways living at home is a good thing because of family health issues - I might have had to come back home anyway. My parents are elderly, so it's probably too late to move out now.  ""I'm paying towards household bills and groceries. We try to make the best of it, but we do get fed up of society saying I should move out - sometimes you don't always have a choice!"" ""I have a full-time job and help at home by paying towards the mortgage, utilities, and I do household chores.  ""Even though I contribute at home, I still follow my parents' house rules - the main one is that I can't bring a male visitor to stay at my parents' house overnight.  ""Also, I have to let them know if I'm going out, where I'm going and with whom just in case of emergency, but I don't mind. It's just a sign of gratitude and respect.  ""In my culture as a Filipino, it's normal for children to live with their parents even if they're all grown up. We have a close-knit family. ""I think when parents take care of their kids from newborn to 18, it's the kids' turn to take care of their parents when they get old. ""Nowadays, people are trying to save money especially after college when a lot of us are in debt so more people are staying longer at home with parents.  ""I have four siblings who all moved out when they got married. I'm still single and so I'm at home. But I don't feel any pressure to move out. The thought of moving out by myself never occurred to me."" Interviews by Andree Massiah, UGC Hub & Social News team"
Volatility,Council may fund leisure site after investment gap,2024-09-25,2022-10-08,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-63179050,"Work on a multi-million pound leisure development in Rotherham may start in November, according to the council. But the authority has been asked to pay for the upfront costs of the Forge Island project in the town centre. The riverside development has already secured a cinema, hotel and five restaurant businesses as tenants. Councillor Denise Lelliott said if the council funded the project it would lead to ""a commercial benefit for taxpayers"" in rents and parking fees. Preparation work including the creation of flood mitigation measures has been completed at the site. But private investors were unable to provide as much money for the project as initially planned, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council will discuss plans to take over the costs at a meeting on 17 October. Ms Lelliott, cabinet member for the economy, said Forge Island is a ""flagship development"" and it was ""exciting news"" that construction work could begin within weeks. But she said: ""It's become clear in recent months that volatility in the financial markets is making private financing of Forge Island less viable and would lead to further delays. ""By incorporating the scheme into the council's capital programme, we can have contractors on site within weeks and begin to realise a commercial benefit for taxpayers directly and much sooner."" Some opposition councillors raised concerns about the council taking over funding of the project. Conservative councillor Greg Reynolds asked a meeting why the project had taken so long and said: ""I suspect that now it's too late, young people stream their media, people don't go to the cinema any more."" Another Conservative councillor, Charlie Wooding, said he feared economic conditions would ""continue to decline"" and that this would have an impact on whether commercial properties could be leased out. The council has not revealed details of how much money it could put towards the project. Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Volatility,House prices 'rebounded in April',2024-09-25,2019-05-08,By Kevin Peachey,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48199086,"UK house prices picked up in April following a fall in values the previous month, according to the country's biggest mortgage lender. The Halifax, part of Lloyds Banking Group, said property values rose by 1.1% in April compared with March when prices fell 1.25%. The annual rate of growth almost doubled with house prices up 5% compared to a year earlier when house prices dropped. The average home is valued at £236,619. Compared with 10 years ago, which was the trough in house prices amid the financial crisis, the typical UK property has risen in value by £81,956, the equivalent of a 4.3% average annual increase. Various house price surveys have painted a subdued picture for property values in the last couple of years.  The annual house price rise of 5% reported by the Halifax, based on its own mortgage data, is out of step with many other surveys. For example, the Nationwide Building Society said April was the fifth month in a row in which annual house price growth was below 1%. The year-on-year volatility has been explained by the Halifax as a result of the comparison with a low growth rate over the corresponding period in 2018. The Halifax calculates its annual change figure based on the last three months compared with the same three months a year earlier, in an attempt to smooth out any volatility. Yet, analysts still say the latest estimate from the Halifax should be treated with some scepticism. ""One explanation for ricocheting growth figures like this is persistently low stock levels. In sought after areas, this can lead to demand being supercharged one minute and gone the next, with price rises coming in waves as brief competitions for limited numbers of homes come and go,"" said Lucy Pendleton, founder director of estate agents James Pendleton. ""Even so, the Halifax index's behaviour so far in 2019 has been unusual to say the least."" Mark Harris, chief executive of mortgage broker SPF Private Clients, said: ""The lack of supply and properties coming to the market is most likely continuing to support property prices, while cheap mortgage rates continue to attract those who are ready to take the plunge."""
Volatility,How is Northern Ireland's energy market different?,2024-09-25,2022-08-14,By Clodagh Rice,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-62525562,"The UK's new Prime Minister, Liz Truss, has announced her plan to tackle the energy crisis. The government has promised Northern Ireland households will get the same support with energy bills as the rest of the UK but it is not clear how that will be delivered. That's because Northern Ireland has a separate energy market from the rest of the UK, with its own rules and regulator. We are all acutely aware that there is a global energy price crisis, with warnings of further increases on the horizon. The supply of gas from Russia to Europe being under threat, meant wholesale price jumped again last month. There has been a 600% increase in wholesale gas between July 2021 and this year. It hit £3.52 per therm on Tuesday 26 July.  This is six times higher than on the same day in 2020.  That is still lower than the highest price we have seen this year - a record £4.95 in early March. Wholesale costs make up about two thirds of your gas bill which is why suppliers have then increased their prices. Two thirds of homes in Northern Ireland use home heating oil.  The home heating oil market is not regulated as there are so many different suppliers - there is more competition. Currently 500 litres (109.9 gallons) is costing £412.51 - that is 89% higher than the same time last year, when it would have cost £218.66, and 60% higher than pre-pandemic levels. If we take each of the gas suppliers, SSE Airtricity for example which supplies the Greater Belfast area, an annual bill is 142% higher than April 2021 at £1,242.30. Firmus Energy, which supplies towns across Northern Ireland, current average annual bills are 190% higher than April 2021 at £1,504.22. Power NI which is the largest electricity supplier in Northern Ireland, the average annual bill in July 2022 was £944, that is 55% higher than in April 2021 when it was £610. The energy market in Northern Ireland is regulated by the Utility Regulator. It regulates the prices of three suppliers - two gas companies (SSE Airtricity and Firmus) and one electricity provider Power NI. It also cap their profits at 2% for gas suppliers and 2.2% for Power NI. It is called the energy price cap - it basically means there is a maximum amount that suppliers can charge customers for each unit of energy. It was designed to protect consumers from price volatility. Until recently, it was reviewed twice a year. It is now going to be reviewed every three months to try and prevent suppliers from going bust. Many suppliers have been in financial distress as they have to absorb the increasing cost as they can't raise prices, but when they go bust, it is consumers who ultimately foot the bill. In Northern Ireland, suppliers can announce price increases as and when they need to, as long as it is approved by the Utility Regulator, who scrutinises their costs. It means that while we have more frequent announcements, they are more gradual increases than those seen in the rest of the UK, where typically there are two massive hikes.  If we take a look at the regulated electricity price in Northern Ireland, it is lower than in the rest of the UK. Whereas, gas prices are a bit different, it depends what supplier you are with.  The average bill in Greater Belfast area is lower than Great Britain, but the average Firmus bill is slightly higher. Our system of regulation is more sensitive to change, that can be a good thing or a bad thing.  While we get increases passed on to us more quickly, our system means when prices come down we are likely to feel that more quickly too. In England, Scotland and Wales the next increase is due in October. Northern Ireland's system means we do not know when the next price rises will be, but we do know the regulator previously said that any further market volatility would translate into higher prices for consumers. If some of the anticipated increases in GB are announced in October, then that would make average bills substantially higher in the rest of the UK compared to how things currently stand in Northern Ireland. But we do not know when or how much prices here could go up in the meantime."
Volatility,Bitcoin could derail China's climate change targets,2024-09-25,2021-04-08,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56671488,"Bitcoin mining in China is so carbon intensive that it could threaten the country's emissions reduction targets, according to new research.  China wants its emissions to peak in 2030, and has plans to be carbon neutral by 2060.  The cryptocurrency's carbon footprint is as large as one of China's ten largest cities, the study found.   China accounts for more than 75% of bitcoin mining around the world, researchers said.   The study was written by academics from the University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Tsinghua University, Cornell University and the University of Surrey. It was published by the peer-reviewed journal Nature Communications.  ""Without appropriate interventions and feasible policies, the intensive bitcoin blockchain operation in China can quickly grow as a threat that could potentially undermine the emission reduction effort taken place in the country,"" it warned.  Some rural areas in China are popular among bitcoin miners, mainly due to the cheaper electricity prices and undeveloped land to house the servers.  Miners play a dual role, effectively auditing bitcoin transactions in exchange for the opportunity to acquire the digital currency. The process requires enormous computing power, and in turn consumes huge amounts of energy.    Already, bitcoin-related emissions in China exceed the total emissions of the Czech Republic and Qatar in 2016.   By 2024, China's bitcoin operations will exceed the total energy consumption of Italy and Saudi Arabia, and would rank 12th among nations.   At its peak, it could account for about 5.41% of China's electricity generation emissions.   The researchers said a carbon tax would be relatively ineffective for bitcoin, and suggested ""site regulation"" policies instead.  The researchers said the ""attractive financial incentive of bitcoin mining"" has caused an arms race in dedicated mining hardware The price of the cryptocurrency surged during the pandemic, rising from $7,000 last April to pass $60,000 in March before hitting a period of volatility.    Bitcoin's price increase was pushed higher by well-known companies adopting it as a method of payment, including electric carmaker Tesla. The Covid-19 pandemic also likely played a part, with more people shopping online and moving further away from physical currencies. Critics have long charged that in addition to its environmental impact, its main use is as a financial speculation tool rather than as a currency.   They also worry that it is prone to market manipulation by a few large players.  "

Volatility,Botticelli painting fetches record $92m at auction,2024-09-25,2021-01-28,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-55839330,"A portrait by Sandro Botticelli has sold for $92m (£67m) at auction, breaking a new record for the Italian renaissance painter. Young Man Holding a Roundel is believed to have been painted in the 1470s or 1480s and is considered one of Botticelli's finest portraits. It sold on Thursday at a Sotheby's auction in New York. The sale marks the first major indicator of the state of the art market this year. Prior to its sale, questions hung over the willingness of global art collectors to pay nine-figure sums for trophy works amid the coronavirus pandemic and market volatility. The successful sale of the Botticelli piece could help boost prices for other such paintings at a time when many art collectors are chasing newer works from post-war and contemporary artists. Sotheby's senior vice president Christopher Apostle described Young Man Holding a Roundel as a ""masterpiece"" ahead of the auction. ""This Botticelli is so much more spectacular in every way than anything we've seen coming to the market,"" he told the AFP news agency. ""This image symbolises and exemplifies the Renaissance in Florence. We haven't seen anything like it in my lifetime,"" he added. The painting shows a man in his late teenage years with long golden hair sitting holding a disc - the roundel - which features a bearded saint with his right hand raised. The roundel is an original 14th Century artwork attributed to Sienese painter Bartolommeo Bulgarini. Sotheby's displayed the painting around the world to collectors and potential bidders in advance of the auction in an effort to increase demand. ""The young man in the painting has done more travel during Covid than probably anybody we know,"" joked Charles Stewart, CEO of Sotheby's. It was displayed in Los Angeles, London and Dubai and accompanied by a catalogue with scholarly essays and technical analysis. The painting sold for $80m (£58.2), but the final price will be $92.2m (£67.1m) when fees and commissions are added. The auction was live streamed from New York and lasted less than five minutes with only two competitors for the painting, according to The New York Times. The selling price establishes the work as one of the most significant portraits to have ever sold at auction. The previous record for a Botticelli was set in 2013 when Madonna and Child with Young Saint John the Baptist sold for $10.4m (£7.6m). Other paintings which have sold for prices in this range include Gustav Klimt's Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer II, which sold for $87.9m (£64m) in 2006 and Vincent Van Gogh's Portrait of Dr Gachet, which fetched $82.5m (£60m) 1990. It is understood Young Man Holding a Roundel has been handed down through several generations of an aristocratic family in Wales for about 200 years. Art scholars were unaware of the painting's existence until it first appeared on the market in the early 20th Century. It has spent much of the last 40 years on public display since its current owner acquired it in 1982 for just £810,000. The painting has appeared at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art, the National Gallery in London and elsewhere. Botticelli, who lived from the 1440s to 1510, is one of the most celebrated painters of the early Renaissance period, but only about a dozen examples of his work survive today. Botticelli was forgotten for centuries after his death, but his work was rediscovered in the 19th Century, and the artist has since become one of the biggest names in art history. His best-known works are The Birth of Venus and Primavera. In 2016, an exhibition at London's V&A Museum, Botticelli Reimagined, explored the artist's enduring impact, particularly on today's pop culture.  The exhibition included a 2009 recreation of The Birth of Venus by photographer David LaChapelle, as well as interpretations of the same painting by Andy Warhol. The front cover of Lady Gaga's 2013 album Artpop also incorporated elements of the The Birth of Venus, and the painting inspired one of the lead singles from the album, Venus.

Volatility,World's shift to clean energy is 'unstoppable',2024-09-25,2023-10-24,By Esme Stallard,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-67198206,"The world is on an ""unstoppable"" shift towards renewable energy but the phase down of fossil fuels is not happening quickly enough, a new report says.  The International Energy Agency, the global energy watchdog, predicted renewables would provide half of the world's electricity by 2030. But it warned that emissions were still too high to prevent temperatures rising above a key threshold of 1.5C. And the report said investment in fossil fuels needed to be cut in half. The Paris-based energy agency's report, released on Tuesday, was not all doom and gloom. It praised the significant progress countries had made in expanding renewable energy and supporting consumers with the shift to electric vehicles and heat pumps instead of gas boilers. The report said the growth in clean energy and technologies was ""impressive"". In 2020, one in 25 cars sold was electric. Just three years later this number has risen to one in five. ""The transition to clean energy is happening worldwide and it's unstoppable. It's not a question of 'if', it's just a matter of 'how soon' - and the sooner the better for all of us,"" said International Energy Agency (IEA) Executive Director Fatih Birol. The report recognised that oil and gas would continue to play a role in the world's economy and that maintaining investment was ""essential"". But it said at the moment, current levels of funding were double what they should be. ""Governments, companies and investors need to get behind clean energy transitions rather than hindering them,"" Mr Birol said.  In what appeared to be a criticism of the UK and other governments' decisions to open new oil fields, Mr Birol added: ""claims that oil and gas represent safe or secure choices for the world's energy and climate future look weaker than ever."" Earlier this year Rosebank oil field off the coast of Scotland was given the go-ahead amidst much controversy. Environmental campaigners argued the decision was not compliant with the UK's climate change plans. But Claire Coutinho, the government's minister for energy, said at the time: ""[The government] will continue to back the UK's oil and gas industry to underpin our energy security"". A spokesperson for the Department of Energy Security and Net Zero said in response to the IEA report that the independent Climate Change Committee recognised oil and gas would continue to be part of the UK's energy mix on the path to net zero. The world's reliance on fossil fuels means that we are still on track to be facing a global average temperature rise of 2.4C by 2100. That compares with the pledge made in 2015 when political leaders agreed on limiting temperature rises to ""well below"" 2C and to make every effort to keep it under 1.5C, to avoid the most dangerous impacts of climate change. World leaders will meet in Dubai at the end of November for COP28 - the UN climate summit - where it is hoped further commitments to tackling climate change will be made, including potentially agreeing to phase out ""unabated"" fossil fuels. Abatement refers to technologies, which are not yet available at scale, that could capture the emissions released when fossil fuels are burned. The IEA report also reflected concerns about the Middle East. The agency said it was not yet clear what impact rising tensions would have on world energy markets. But the IEA warned that it meant further uncertainty compounding an already unsettled global economy - Middle Eastern countries, such as Iran and Saudi Arabia - account for 67% of world oil reserves. The report drew parallels with the 1973 oil crisis when Arab oil producers imposed an embargo in response to Western support for Israel in the Yom Kippur war against Arab states led by Egypt and Syria. As a result petrol prices skyrocketed, with knock-on effects on inflation and high unemployment. The IEA said that this time around the world is also facing the impact of volatile gas prices. The UK increased its imports of LNG following the invasion of Ukraine to reduce its reliance on Russian gas and 14% of the UK's gas is now supplied as LNG from Qatar. But the agency hoped the establishment and expansion of solar and wind energy will provide a long term solution to energy volatility."
Volatility,Rwanda policy unlawful and 'radical' NHS overhaul,2024-09-25,2023-06-30,By BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-the-papers-66061474,"The government's planned shake-up of the NHS gets front page coverage from many of Friday's papers.  The Daily Telegraph says Prime Minister Rishi Sunak will today unveil the ""most radical"" reform of the NHS in its history - including measures to create an army of junior and apprentice roles, and speed up clinical training. Writing in the paper, Steve Barclay, the health secretary, says the plan constitutes ""the most radical modernisation and reform of the workforce since the NHS was founded in 1948"".  The Times says that after years of wrangling with the Treasury, the NHS has got almost everything it asked for. Sunak's allies tell the paper that a big expansion of auxiliary roles will benefit patients next year. However, the paper adds, he faces questions about how the plan will help a health service struggling with record waiting lists. The Daily Mail leads with the prime minister's robust response to a ruling by the Court of Appeal that government plans to send asylum seekers to Rwanda are unlawful, describing it as ""Rishi's blast"". The paper predicts the case will take months to resolve, increasing the likelihood of ""immigration and human rights becoming key battlegrounds in the run-up to the next election"". The Metro says the plans have been thrown out ""yet again"" by the courts and that Sunak's personal pledge to ""stop the boats"" is in jeopardy. ""Grounded Hog Day for Rishi"" is its headline. The Daily Telegraph quotes a government source saying ministers were ""positive"" about their chances in an appeal - if one is granted. In an editorial, the Times says Sunak can't wait with fingers crossed for the outcome of an appeal to the Supreme Court and needs a plan B. The Guardian says the Tories risk a bitter legal feud in their bid to fight the ruling.  The i leads on the volatility facing mortgages, warning of a ""snowball effect"" as lenders try to avoid offering the cheapest deals because they can't cope with the surge in demand. It reports that borrowers are scrambling to get the least expensive home loans before they suddenly disappear - with mortgage brokers warning of future rapid rate hikes. British households withdrew £4.6bn from bank accounts last month, the highest level since monthly records began in 1997, according to the Financial Times. The paper says the data, published by the Bank of England, suggests consumers are either shopping around for higher interest rates or tapping into their savings to pay their bills.  The front page of the Daily Mirror carries a picture of a letter to the prime minister, written by a seven-year-old girl called Poppy, asking him to provide free meals to all primary school children - an issue on which the Mirror campaigns. ""If you don't have much money you can't have food. If you don't have food your brain won't learn,"" it reads. The paper says it's ""time to fork out""."
Volatility,"Carney: 150,000 firms 'not ready for no-deal'",2024-09-25,2019-06-21,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48710999,"About 150,000 businesses still do not have the paperwork they need to keep exporting to the EU in the event of a no-deal Brexit, Mark Carney has said.  The Bank of England governor added that many had built up contingency stocks, but these would only last ""weeks"". ""Business will be reliant on what the governments are able to do in order to keep the ports open, the trade flowing,"" he told the Today programme. But he said the financial system was prepared for a no-deal scenario.    The UK is due to leave the EU by 31 October after seeking an extension to leave the bloc back in March.  Boris Johnson, considered the favourite in the race to become the next prime minister, has said the UK must leave in October, even if it has not struck a deal.  His rival, Jeremy Hunt, has said the UK may need more time, although he would accept no-deal as a last resort.  Ahead of his Mansion House speech to the City on Thursday, Mr Carney said about three quarters of UK businesses have done as much as they could do to prepare for a no-deal.  ""But it doesn't mean they are fully ready, in fact far from it,"" he told the BBC.  He also stressed that in the event of a no-deal exit, the return of trade tariffs on goods shipped to the EU would be ""automatic"".  This contradicts a claim from Mr Johnson that the UK could secure a 10-year standstill in current arrangements using an article of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade known as ""Gatt 24"".  ""The Gatt rules are clear... Gatt 24 applies if you have a [withdrawal] agreement, not if you've decided not to have an agreement, or you have been unable to come to an agreement,"" Mr Carney said.   ""So... we should be clear that not having an agreement with the European Union would mean that there are tariffs, automatically, because the Europeans have to apply the same rules to us as they apply to everyone else.""  Mr Carney also said he was cautiously open to Facebook's new digital currency, Libra, which is due to launch in the first half of next year.  But he said the Bank would be setting ""ground rules upfront"" to protect consumers and their data, and that Libra ""had to be safe or it is not going to happen"". ""Welcome to the world of finance: there is oversight, there is consumer protection, there is market integrity, people have certain rights to privacy that have to be respected.  ""And we're not going to allow a network that comes into place that is a network for criminals and terrorists."" Facebook unveiled details about Libra this week, claiming the virtual currency would be as easy to use as texting. It said Libra would be independently managed, backed by real assets and pegged to a basket of well-known currencies.  But there have been concerns about how people's data and cash will be protected, as well as the currency's potential volatility.  Mr Carney said: ""All the major global central banks and supervisors would have direct regulatory control of this if it is going to work, which is an open question, and we have an open mind about it."""
Volatility,'Optimism reminiscent of last crisis',2024-09-25,2018-01-23,By Joe Miller,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42791869,"The newfound optimism about the state of the global economy is eerily reminiscent of the lead-up to the last financial crisis, the head of Barclays has warned. ""I do feel like that it is a little bit like 2006,"" Jes Staley told delegates at the World Economic Forum in Davos. ""When we were all talking about whether we had solved the riddle of economic crises.""   But he said big banks were now in a better position to deal with shocks. Mr Staley's comments were delivered at the opening of an upbeat forum in the Swiss resort, at which the IMF upgraded its global growth forecast for 2018 to 3.9%. Additionally, a survey of more than 1,200 chief executives by PwC found that most believed the world economy would ""improve"" over the next 12 months. Speaking on a panel ominously entitled ""The Next Financial Crisis"", Mr Staley said that despite an encouraging recovery, ""there is something out there in the capital markets"". ""Equity markets are at an all time high and volatility is at an all time low - that is not a sustainable proposition,"" he cautioned. He hinted that if the stress tests that Barclays was subjected to by the Bank of England were applied to other sectors of the economy, they would not be found to be in rude health, primarily because of high levels of debt. Mr Staley also argued that the next financial shock would not be the fault of banks like Barclays and reiterated his faith in financial regulators. ""On one level, pre-2008, the regulators were there just to bear witness,"" he told Davos attendees. ""Today, the political body have told the regulators, I want you to regulate the system… so you avoid the next financial crisis."" Fellow banking heavyweight Michael Corbat, the chief executive of Citigroup, shared Mr Staley's view that lenders were less exposed to risk, and emphasised that they had reverted to their core mission. ""We are not an insurance company, we are not an asset manager, we are not a hedge fund,"" Mr Corbat said. ""We are simply a bank."" Harvard economist Ken Rogoff, while sanguine about the prospect of a downturn in the near future, warned that there would be few tools left to deal with one if it occurred. ""There really isn't even a Plan A for central banks,"" he said, adding that although there would be probably be further fiscal stimulus and quantitative easing, ""I don't think either would work as well as they did last time"". The risk of political upheaval, which was front and centre at last year's WEF, seems to have faded, and Donald Trump, who will bring his protectionist message to Davos on Friday, was hardly mentioned by executives. Of more concern, according to Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS Markit, were ""low-level threats"" that could end up ruining the recovery. ""The most worrisome are policy mistakes either in the United States - a fiscal shock or a trade war - or in China,"" he said, referring to overzealous interest rate rises in the former, and a rapidly reduction of debt in the latter. But Mr Behravesh added that while the risk trade friction was ""uncomfortably high"", the chances of an out-and-out trade war were still low.  Ray Nolte, managing partner at ‎investment firm SkyBridge Capital, also downplayed the prospects of another crisis, but said the harmonious nature of current economic growth was of concern. ""This really is a global recovery. Europe has really pulled out of it, the US is doing well, Asia is doing pretty well - much more coordinated than in past cycles where you have always had one country lagging, or one region lagging."" However, the very fact that the recovery was happening pretty much everywhere could spell bad news, he explained. ""What will tend to happen is countries will get out of step at the same time. This can have a cascading effect."" ""You had the US able to bail out Europe in 2011… you don't have that if everyone is in sync."" Yet Mr Nolte noted that while the global economy was motoring ahead at a steady pace - it was not yet at breakneck speed. ""It's not like we are at 4% growth and the breaks are going to have to be jammed on,"" he said. ""This party can go on for an extended period of time"". According to Prof Rogoff, anticipating precisely how the party will eventually end is no less tricky than it was 12 years ago. ""It will happen,"" he predicted, ""somewhere none of us are looking"". Citigroup, CEO Michael Corbat struck a more sombre note:  ""There is a numbness out there, there is an ambivalence out there that's concerning. ""When the next turn comes - and it will come - it's likely to be more violent than it would otherwise be."""
Volatility,North Korea gears up for 'biggest military parade',2024-09-25,2020-10-08,By Laura Bicker,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-54459248,"North Korea is preparing for what is expected to be the largest military parade in its history. Thousands of soldiers have practised for months to ensure that each step is marched with precision and each fervent cry of adoration will be heard by the Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un. These events are often ostentatious formal displays of military might to show a devoted people paying homage to their leader in closely directed goose-stepping drills. Mistakes are not tolerated. But these parades can also be part provocation. A chance to show off new missiles and weaponry despite being under strict economic sanctions. The state has not featured any ballistic missiles in its parades since Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un held their first summit in 2018.  Talks between the two sides broke down in Hanoi last February without a deal and North Korea has continued to test a number of new short range ballistic missiles.   This event, on 10 October, to mark the 75th anniversary of the founding of the Workers' Party comes just weeks before the US presidential election. So is North Korea going to use it to make a point and prove that it still has weapons capable of striking the United States? It's certainly going to be big, according to the editor-in-chief of the Daily NK, a Seoul-based website with paid sources in the North.  Lee Sang Yong told me that as early as March, Pyongyang had ordered its military to mobilise 32,000 soldiers. It's become so large that the site where soldiers practise has had to be expanded. ""The Pyongyang Mirim airport now has two new roads and 10 new buildings. Therefore, I think it is likely that we will see Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles [ICBMs] or Submarine Launched Ballistic Missiles [SLBMs] on display at the parade this time,"" he said.  ""Also, 600 students and researchers from Kim Il-sung University will also take part. This is not an insignificant number. This university is where they develop new talent for missile development. By bringing them to the parade or putting them on display, North Korea may be trying to install pride and respect for the missile development talents."" Jeongmin Kim, an analyst with NK News, said North Korea does not always use these events to prove a point to the outside world. ""We have to remember that many times - for a hereditary dictatorship especially - they constantly have to prove legitimacy to rule to their domestic audience.  ""So 10 October will also aim to do exactly that: trying to show its people, with dazzling parades with uplifting propaganda slogans, that they are 'doing okay', despite all of what has been going on this year.  ""Of course, precedents do point to the possibility of Kim Jong-un or other high-level officials making a speech that may involve some message aimed at the outside world, such as how they are not waiting around for sanctions relief any more and will focus on 'self-reliance'."" While some will be watching for any new missiles on display, there is growing concern about the welfare of the 25 million North Korean people. 2020 has been a bad year for most countries, but for North Korea it has the potential to be devastating. ""I hear there is a surge in the number of orphans and homeless street kids in the North this year,"" said Lee Sang Yong. ""Even though we cannot even imagine it here in South Korea - there are people in the North who are dying and starving."" The state closed its borders to the outside world in January to prevent an outbreak of Covid 19 spreading from neighbouring China.  Authorities have reportedly issued ""shoot-to-kill"" orders along the border and created a buffer zone to stop anyone entering the country.  Diplomatic sources told me earlier this year that stockpiles of PPE and other essential medical supplies, including vaccines, had built up at the border with China, unable to get through. North Korea claims to have had no cases of Covid-19, but Kim Jong-un continues to hold high-level meetings to ensure tight restrictions remain in place. The North Korean people are now cut off from the outside world more than ever before. Even movement between provinces has been limited. ""Land, sea, and air. It's a complete shutdown of both people and material,"" said Mr Lee.  ""Unless you are military personnel or a high-ranking officer, no one is moving inside of North Korea. Quarantine measures against Covid-19 are so tight. ""The North Korean economy has come to a halt. Smugglers and small traders at the border have questioned why the regime is risking the fate of the economy if there is no Covid-19 in the country."" Six months' training for 10 minutes on parade Trade with its key ally China has plummeted by nearly 70% in the first eight months of this year, as compared to last year.  The impoverished state has also been battered by extreme weather in recent months and Korean state television spends its afternoons showing ""heroic"" efforts to overcome the damage from several typhoons. Kim Jong-un has now ordered a nationwide drive to try to boost the ailing economy, describing it as an ""80-day battle"".   In short, that means more work for the North Korean people, extra hours in the fields or factories and additional duties in their towns and villages. The harder they struggle, the more loyal they will seem to local leaders. The message blasted across state TV is one of ""self-reliance"". In the South, farms across the country are busy harvesting rice. But it's hard to know if this is happening in the North. It's difficult to get a clear picture of how badly the state's harvests have been hit, but with 11 million people in the country thought to be food insecure, even a small number of rain-ravaged fields can amount to thousands going hungry. My team travelled to the Demilitarised Zone near Geosong on the east coast. We drive past white sandy beaches flanked by high barbed wire. Bright blue skies give us a crystal clear view of the mountains to the north. A few checkpoints are visible on the peaks From here, curious South Koreans love to peer into the North. This is as close as they can get. Pyongyang dramatically cut off all communication with Seoul in June and blew up the inter-Korean liaison office Earlier this month an incident in disputed waters to the west of the peninsula saw a South Korean man, thought to have been trying to defect, shot and killed. His body was burned.  It shocked South Koreans. And yet the North still has friends here. Some still harbour hopes of ending the 70-year war even after Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un could not reach a deal on denuclearisation. Just three years ago, North and South Koreans competed together at the Winter Olympics in Gangwon province and the local governor believes it's time to look again at these types of exchanges as a path to peace. ""The effort to reach a big deal resulted in no deal. It is time for us to go back to develop non-political initiatives and to achieve small deals in sport and cultural exchanges,"" said Choi Moon Soon. ""It is very unfortunate that we are left with the situation that even small exchanges between North and South Korea are cut off by pursuing the political big deal and revealing differences in the process."" Mr Choi would like to create a United Nations peace zone at the border.  International sanctions mean this is an unlikely dream for now. Instead Mr Choi acknowledged that North Korea is keeping a close eye on the US presidential election to figure out its next move. ""I am not sure if I will see North and South Korea unified in my life time but I have two daughters and I would like it if they didn't inherit this volatile situation. We live with continuing threat and potential of conflict. We shouldn't pass down this volatility to our next generation."" That may be out of his hands and instead fall to whoever wins the White House. Pyongyang is trying to read the situation inside and outside its country. It's not yet clear which path it's willing to take.  Will its current perilous predicament eventually encourage Kim Jong-un back to the negotiating table. Or will he look further inward and keep the borders closed. The North Korean leader has been unusually quiet this year. This parade is a chance to show his hand and his agenda and put the fate of his country back into the public eye."
Volatility,US suggests Russia could be behind gas pipe leaks,2024-09-25,2022-09-29,By Jonathan Josephs,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63084613,"The US has said it ""seems"" Russia is to blame for this week's leaks in the Nord Stream gas pipelines. US Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm told the BBC an investigation was being carried out into the cause of what she called ""an act of sabotage"", adding ""it is highly unlikely that these incidents are coincidence"" No evidence about how the leaks happened has been made public. Russia has dismissed suggestions that it was to blame. It said claims it had damaged the pipelines were ""stupid and absurd"". President Putin described the damage as ""unprecedented sabotage, in fact, an act of international terrorism"" during a phone call with Turkey's President Erdogan, according to the Kremlin, which added Russia plans to bring it up for ""urgent discussion"" at the UN Security Council. Earlier Russia's Foreign Ministry suggest it was the US that stood to benefit from the pipeline being out of action because it would be able to increase its own natural gas sales. The White House has dismissed such suggestions. ""It's probably most likely some form of sabotage,"" according to Mike Fulwood of the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies. ""If there was one incident of a pipeline rupture of leak then accidental damage could be a possibility, it is very rare. ""The most likely cause of accidental damage is an anchor being dropped and dragging across the pipeline"". He added that with multiple leaks in a short period of time ""doesn't sound like it could be accidental, although theoretically it could be"". The high water pressure at the bottom of sea makes a detonation difficult, according to energy engineering expert Professor Russell Johns of Penn State University.  He says ""it is not likely that the Russians detonated their own pipeline. They could have simply cut-off gas to the pipeline entrance"" if they wanted to stop supplies. The money Russia continues to receive for its fossil fuels is helping fund its invasion of Ukraine.  The gas escaping from the pipeline near the Danish island of Bornholm has been in the pipe since the beginning of September when Moscow closed it off, saying repairs were needed to a vital artery in supplying Europe's energy needs.  Ms Granholm suggested the energy relationship between Russia and Europe was being consigned to history. ""I think Russia has proven itself to be an unreliable energy partner,"" she said. ""No country wants to take the risk of putting a significant amount of its energy demand to Russia's supply. I think this accelerates the EU's push to become energy independent through clean energy"". The war in Ukraine has had a profound impact in pushing up global energy prices. They've been the biggest contributor to soaring inflation in the UK, Eurozone and US, something which is threatening to reduce global economic growth. The increasing cost of living has made political leaders around the world re-evaluate where they get their energy from, according to Ms Granholm, who was speaking from the International Atomic Energy Agency's Ministerial Conference in Vienna. ""Every country is looking at the risks associated with putting too many eggs in one basket or putting too many eggs in the basket of petro-dictators and the volatility of the fossil fuels that accrue from that. Everyone is looking to how they can become energy independent."" Wind, solar and nuclear energy are among the alternatives many countries are trying to increase as they also aim to meet the Paris climate change targets. However an analysis by Columbia University suggests that Russia has a 46% share of global enrichment capacity for nuclear fuel, and the International Energy Agency warned in July that China has an 80% share ""in all the key manufacturing stages of solar panels"". When asked how the US and others don't end up overly reliant on such alternatives Ms Granholm replied that ""this move to clean energy could be part of a great peace plan"" and that such a move ""helps people's pocketbooks, helps the economy, and helps energy security"". This year's steep increases in the price of oil and gas have benefitted the energy giants who get them to consumers. In the first half of this year the combined profit of five of the biggest western energy firms, BP, Shell, Total, Chevron and Exxon almost tripled to just over $95.2bn with much of it going to shareholders. Ms Granholm said President Biden's administration wanted to see such companies lower prices at petrol pumps ""so that citizens are not hurting"". Despite acknowledging that oil is traded on a free market she called on them to help, ""at least the American companies as good American citizens"" and warned they could face a windfall tax similar to what has been seen in the UK. ""We don't want that huge amount of profit to end up triggering consequences, either Congressionally or elsewhere, that will not be in their interest. ""We want them to be responsible and not be buying back shares instead of increasing production, production that would ultimately reduce prices because of increasing supply. We are looking at legislative tools as well as otherwise pressuring them."" One other way the US could help increase the supply of oil to global markets is by lifting some of the sanctions imposed on Venezuela by President Trump. The South American country has the world's largest oil reserves but has been exporting minimal amounts of oil because of the restrictions. They were enacted because of alleged corruption and the political fallout from 2019's contested election.  An increase in supplies would be likely to push down global oil prices. When asked if it was time to lift the sanctions, Ms Granholm didn't dismiss the idea, replying: ""I'm not going to get ahead of the White House on that.""

Viewers in the UK can watch the show at 15:30 on the BBC News Channel, and afterwards on BBC iPlayer.

Volatility,Apple iPhone sales fears rock Wall Street,2024-09-25,2018-11-12,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46186131,"Apple shares sank by 5% on Monday, dragging down US markets and wiping more than $40bn (£31bn; €35bn) off the tech giant's market value. The fall followed a profit warning from some of the firm's suppliers, which exacerbated concerns that demand for iPhones is slowing. The declines made the company one of the biggest losers on the Dow, which closed down 2.3%. The wider S&P 500 ended about 2% lower, while the Nasdaq fell more than 2.75%. Technology stocks led the Wall Street sell-off which saw shares in most sectors tumble.  Tech firms helped drive many of the stock market gains earlier in the year but now face rising calls for regulatory and tax changes that could hurt their growth. Amazon shares lost more than 4%, Alphabet dropped over 2.5% while Facebook fell 2.3%. Apple's share price fall came after Lumentum, a US manufacturer of facial recognition technology and Apple supplier, said one of its major customers had reduced its shipments. As a result, Lumentum downgraded its sales and profit outlook, sending its shares down over 30%. Lumentum's warning came shortly after another Apple supplier, Japan Display, also cut its full-year guidance blaming ""volatile customer demand"". The warnings from Apple suppliers extended a slide in Apple shares that started earlier this month after the firm's sales forecast disappointed investors. The shares closed at about $194, down 5% for the day and more than 15% below their peak in October. Apple has insisted that it is optimistic about its Christmas season outlook, attributing the weaker than expected forecast to one-off changes, such as the timing of the release of new phones, and temporary supply chain issues. It continues to make record profits, thanks to higher prices and growing income from its services business, which includes services such as the App Store, Apple Pay, Apple Music. But analysts have remained sceptical, especially after the firm said it would stop sharing the number of iPhones, iPads and Macs it sells with investors. They have warned that Apple's reliance on higher prices could also make it especially vulnerable if there is a broader pullback in consumer spending. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs, which has been embroiled in a corruption scandal at Malaysia's state-backed development fund, also dragged Wall Street indexes lower.  Shares in the investment bank ended down about 7.5%, after a Malaysian official said the country wanted a refund of the fees Goldman earned for work on bond sales for the 1MDB fund. A former Goldman executive this month pleaded guilty to US charges that he had participated in a scheme to use some of the money raised in those offerings for bribes. The US market declines come amid an extended period of volatility on Wall Street, with investors wary due to warnings of a slowdown in global growth, trade tensions, falling oil prices and rising interest rates. US companies are also facing a rising dollar, which hurts sales overseas.  The combination of factors has helped fuel speculation that corporate profits may be at their peak, especially after several companies, including Apple and Amazon, issued weaker than expected sales forecasts for the months ahead."
Volatility,Amazon staff told to work overtime as virus hits,2024-09-25,2020-03-17,By Lora Jones,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51921916,"Workers at Amazon's UK warehouses are being told to work overtime to tackle huge demand due to the coronavirus pandemic, despite government calls to restrict social contact. The GMB union says that workers across at least four different sites were informed that they had to work ""compulsory overtime"" from Monday. National officer Mick Rix said Amazon had put ""profit before safety"". Amazon said it was working to ensure it can continue to deliver to customers.  Compulsory overtime means that some employees must work additional hours as requested by an employer - if their contract says so. Amazon employs 27,000 people in the UK and has 17 warehouses.  One worker at Amazon's Dunfermline warehouse in Scotland, who asked not to be named, told the BBC that staff in the ""inbound goods"" department are having additional hours imposed.  The worker, who thinks they have a compulsory overtime clause in their contract, believes this will be for at least two weeks. They said that there is extra pressure on the workforce to deal with an influx of goods the company is bringing in due to a spike in demand.  Sought-after items include bleach, handwash, nappies, large boxes of rice and powdered milk. The worker added that these actions were ""very rare"" outside of the Christmas trading period or Amazon ""Prime week"", where the firm offers discounts on goods for subscribers. The worker said other departments in the Dunfermline warehouse are not saying staff should do more hours, but offering them up to 60 hours of voluntary overtime. An Amazon spokesperson confirmed that the company had ramped up shifts across the UK. They said: ""As demand continues to increase, we are working to ensure we can continue to deliver to the most-impacted customers while keeping our people safe"". ""Many of these customers have no other way to get essential items and we want to be sure that we have the right resources in place to deliver on their needs.  ""Starting this week, we'll be prioritising the intake and dispatch of items most needed by our customers right now. These are items such as food, health and personal care products, items needed to work from home, books and toys for children."" Amazon also said that there is an exemptions process in place for employees who cannot work additional hours for personal reasons, such as caring responsibilities. On Monday, Boris Johnson said people should work from home where possible as part of a range of stringent new measures to stop the spread of coronavirus. The GMB union's national officer Mick Rix called the overtime reports ""extremely concerning"", and accused Amazon of ""imposing its demands on workers without any regard for their safety"". Mr Rix said he was concerned that if staff are overworked, stress will make them more susceptible to the Covid-19 virus. Sarah Evans, employment law partner at JMW solicitors, said that if a worker's contract has a clause in it that says there ""may be an element of compulsory overtime"", then a boss is entitled to use it to make them do additional hours. She pointed out that under Working Time Regulations in the UK, overtime is limited to a maximum of 48 hours per week, averaged over a 17-week period.  Workers can ""opt out"" of the maximum weekly limit, however, and some are required to do so as a condition of employment.  Hannah Ford, a partner and employment law expert at Stevens & Bolton, said that these were ""unprecedented times, but all employers must operate within the law."" She added: ""All employers also owe an implied duty to take reasonable care for the health and safety of its employees... this extends to mental health as well as physical health."" Workers in the US have also been posting on social media about working overtime at Amazon fulfilment centres. Amazon has said it will hire 100,000 warehouse and delivery workers in the United States to deal with the surge in sales due to pandemic. The online retail giant also said it would increase pay for its staff in the UK, US and Europe. Amazon said it would increase hourly wages by $2 in the US, £2 in the UK, and €2 in Europe. The company said it expects the pay rises expected to cost it more than $350m (£285m)."

Reasons for staying at home range from the culturally acceptable to the financial. Here, people in their 30s describe their current living arrangements with mum and dad. ""I have lived my whole life in Calgary, an oil and gas-based city. I saw an abundance of oil and gas jobs in the industry growing up, and becoming a petroleum geologist seemed like a natural course to take. ""I was thrilled when I got my first permanent job at a small oil company, and later I had saved enough money for a down payment on a small townhouse.  ""But in July 2016 the company I worked for declared bankruptcy as the price of oil fell. I received no severance but I was able to sell my townhouse (at a loss) right before the company went under.  ""My parents and I have always had a good relationship and they were gracious enough to let me move back in with them. They recognise and understand the issues young Canadians encounter.  ""A lot of my friends are in the same position and understand the situation I am in. If anything, it's me who is putting pressure on myself to leave home. ""There is still considerable volatility in my employment and in the Canadian oil and gas industry. I am not confident in moving forward and purchasing or renting a new place. ""I would now consider myself in a place of 'precarious employment'.  I have no employment insurance, no health or dental coverage. I am not alone in my career uncertainty. I feel I have done everything right, but I still feel anxiety towards the future of my career.  ""Right now, 'leaving the nest' is just not a financially wise decision."" ""Tuition fees were introduced at the time I was applying for university so I couldn't afford to go away from home to study.  ""I stayed home and studied at the Open University whilst juggling a business and part-time jobs to pay for tuition, business expenses, transport, domestic contributions and saving for a house deposit.  ""By the time I graduated from the four-year degree and teaching qualification, house prices in my area had quadrupled - £45,000 starter homes went up to £180,000, and I have been priced out ever since.  ""It was devastating - if I got a full-time job at 16 and saved I would have been able to buy a house! ""I think my chance of buying my own home has probably gone.

It can be isolating. ""I've kind of given up now. When I was around 30, I wanted to move out but you get to the point that it's not worth it. I could probably get a deposit together but my wages are not enough to pay for a mortgage.  ""In some ways living at home is a good thing because of family health issues - I might have had to come back home anyway. My parents are elderly, so it's probably too late to move out now.  ""I'm paying towards household bills and groceries. We try to make the best of it, but we do get fed up of society saying I should move out - sometimes you don't always have a choice!"" ""I have a full-time job and help at home by paying towards the mortgage, utilities, and I do household chores.  ""Even though I contribute at home, I still follow my parents' house rules - the main one is that I can't bring a male visitor to stay at my parents' house overnight.  ""Also, I have to let them know if I'm going out, where I'm going and with whom just in case of emergency, but I don't mind. It's just a sign of gratitude and respect.  ""In my culture as a Filipino, it's normal for children to live with their parents even if they're all grown up. We have a close-knit family. ""I think when parents take care of their kids from newborn to 18, it's the kids' turn to take care of their parents when they get old. ""Nowadays, people are trying to save money especially after college when a lot of us are in debt so more people are staying longer at home with parents.  ""I have four siblings who all moved out when they got married. I'm still single and so I'm at home. But I don't feel any pressure to move out.

Volatility,Council may fund leisure site after investment gap,2024-09-25,2022-10-08,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-63179050,"Work on a multi-million pound leisure development in Rotherham may start in November, according to the council. But the authority has been asked to pay for the upfront costs of the Forge Island project in the town centre. The riverside development has already secured a cinema, hotel and five restaurant businesses as tenants. Councillor Denise Lelliott said if the council funded the project it would lead to ""a commercial benefit for taxpayers"" in rents and parking fees. Preparation work including the creation of flood mitigation measures has been completed at the site. But private investors were unable to provide as much money for the project as initially planned, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council will discuss plans to take over the costs at a meeting on 17 October. Ms Lelliott, cabinet member for the economy, said Forge Island is a ""flagship development"" and it was ""exciting news"" that construction work could begin within weeks. But she said: ""It's become clear in recent months that volatility in the financial markets is making private financing of Forge Island less viable and would lead to further delays. ""By incorporating the scheme into the council's capital programme, we can have contractors on site within weeks and begin to realise a commercial benefit for taxpayers directly and much sooner."" Some opposition councillors raised concerns about the council taking over funding of the project. Conservative councillor Greg Reynolds asked a meeting why the project had taken so long and said: ""I suspect that now it's too late, young people stream their media, people don't go to the cinema any more."" Another Conservative councillor, Charlie Wooding, said he feared economic conditions would ""continue to decline"" and that this would have an impact on whether commercial properties could be leased out.

Martin Rowley said he anticipates ""a lot of interest"" in the option after Boris Johnson urged people to avoid gatherings with friends and family. Mr Rowley said his York-based business would waive the cost of showing services online. The government has not yet ordered a stop to funerals, he said. Many crematoriums around the country are equipped with facilities to broadcast funerals over the internet via a secure login. Online streams are used by mourners living abroad or those who are unable to leave their homes. However, social distancing and self-isolation could see more people take up this option. Mr Rowley said he plans to waive the £62 live-streaming charge during the coronavirus outbreak. He said: ""In the current crisis, we believe the way in which we can support families is to pay that fee.  ""What we want to do is to make sure that families don't have to cancel a service, that they can still go ahead."" Mr Rowley said he had received several inquiries about whether funeral services would be going ahead with one family, who had been due to travel from Australia, forced to change their plans due to coronavirus. He said that the outbreak might mean ""a simple cremation"" would take place followed by a memorial service at a later date.

Volatility,How is Northern Ireland's energy market different?,2024-09-25,2022-08-14,By Clodagh Rice,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-62525562,"The UK's new Prime Minister, Liz Truss, has announced her plan to tackle the energy crisis. The government has promised Northern Ireland households will get the same support with energy bills as the rest of the UK but it is not clear how that will be delivered. That's because Northern Ireland has a separate energy market from the rest of the UK, with its own rules and regulator. We are all acutely aware that there is a global energy price crisis, with warnings of further increases on the horizon. The supply of gas from Russia to Europe being under threat, meant wholesale price jumped again last month. There has been a 600% increase in wholesale gas between July 2021 and this year. It hit £3.52 per therm on Tuesday 26 July.  This is six times higher than on the same day in 2020.  That is still lower than the highest price we have seen this year - a record £4.95 in early March. Wholesale costs make up about two thirds of your gas bill which is why suppliers have then increased their prices. Two thirds of homes in Northern Ireland use home heating oil.  The home heating oil market is not regulated as there are so many different suppliers - there is more competition. Currently 500 litres (109.9 gallons) is costing £412.51 - that is 89% higher than the same time last year, when it would have cost £218.66, and 60% higher than pre-pandemic levels. If we take each of the gas suppliers, SSE Airtricity for example which supplies the Greater Belfast area, an annual bill is 142% higher than April 2021 at £1,242.30. Firmus Energy, which supplies towns across Northern Ireland, current average annual bills are 190% higher than April 2021 at £1,504.22. Power NI which is the largest electricity supplier in Northern Ireland, the average annual bill in July 2022 was £944, that is 55% higher than in April 2021 when it was £610. The energy market in Northern Ireland is regulated by the Utility Regulator. It regulates the prices of three suppliers - two gas companies (SSE Airtricity and Firmus) and one electricity provider Power NI. It also cap their profits at 2% for gas suppliers and 2.2% for Power NI. It is called the energy price cap - it basically means there is a maximum amount that suppliers can charge customers for each unit of energy. It was designed to protect consumers from price volatility. Until recently, it was reviewed twice a year. It is now going to be reviewed every three months to try and prevent suppliers from going bust. Many suppliers have been in financial distress as they have to absorb the increasing cost as they can't raise prices, but when they go bust, it is consumers who ultimately foot the bill. In Northern Ireland, suppliers can announce price increases as and when they need to, as long as it is approved by the Utility Regulator, who scrutinises their costs. It means that while we have more frequent announcements, they are more gradual increases than those seen in the rest of the UK, where typically there are two massive hikes.  If we take a look at the regulated electricity price in Northern Ireland, it is lower than in the rest of the UK. Whereas, gas prices are a bit different, it depends what supplier you are with.  The average bill in Greater Belfast area is lower than Great Britain, but the average Firmus bill is slightly higher. Our system of regulation is more sensitive to change, that can be a good thing or a bad thing.  While we get increases passed on to us more quickly, our system means when prices come down we are likely to feel that more quickly too. In England, Scotland and Wales the next increase is due in October. Northern Ireland's system means we do not know when the next price rises will be, but we do know the regulator previously said that any further market volatility would translate into higher prices for consumers. If some of the anticipated increases in GB are announced in October, then that would make average bills substantially higher in the rest of the UK compared to how things currently stand in Northern Ireland. But we do not know when or how much prices here could go up in the meantime."
Volatility,Can Morocco solve Europe’s energy crisis?,2024-09-25,2023-05-03,By Jonathan Josephs,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-65415529,"Morocco has big ambitions to export electricity produced by solar and wind farms to Europe, but should it be prioritising such renewable energy for its home market? ""The resources we have here could be one of the big, big answers to European demand,"" says Moroccan energy entrepreneur Moundir Zniber. Mr Zniber is a passionate man who senses opportunity out of crisis. ""I think Morocco represents the best opportunity to get the European continent away from the dependency it has today on Russian gas,"" he says. Mr Zniber has spent the past 15 years building his company, Gaia Energy, into one of the leaders of a renewable energy revolution in his home country. ""Morocco has truly one of the best solar and wind resources in the world combined,"" he says. ""We don't have oil, we don't have natural gas, but we have a potential that is just amazing."" The war in Ukraine has catalysed Europe's politicians to increase their efforts to tackle climate change with new sources of clean energy. Morocco hopes to be part of the solution. It is on Europe's doorstep, and has ambitious plans to generate 52% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030. The hope is that lots of this electricity will be exported via undersea cables to Europe. But at present, the country still has to build many more solar and wind farms. Currently the north African nation of 39 million people depends on imports for 90% of its energy needs, and most of that is from fossil fuels. In 2021, some 80.5% of Morocco's electricity production came from burning coal, gas and oil. By contrast, only 12.4% came from wind power, and 4.4% came from solar. However, Morocco is already making some tangible progress to boost its renewable energy generation, thanks to projects such as the huge Noor-Ouarzazate Solar Complex. With the first phase opening back in 2016, this is now the world's largest concentrated solar power plant. Such facilities use mirrors to reflect and concentrate sunlight onto central tower ""receivers"". These contain fluid that is heated by the light, creating steam that spins turbines to generate electricity. At Noor-Ouarzazate the mirrors are now spread over 3,000 hectares (11.6 sq miles). The facility was developed by Saudi Arabian firm ACWA Power, with funding also coming from the World Bank and European Investment Bank. Mr Zniber says that private Moroccan firms like his are now planning to export solar and wind-generated electricity to Europe, and green hydrogen - hydrogen that has been created by renewable energy. He adds that Gaia Energy is developing wind and solar schemes that could meet up to 4% of Germany and Italy's electricity needs. ""And in terms of green hydrogen we have six projects our company is developing that could answer 25% of the needs of the EU."" Meanwhile, British energy start-up Xlinks has plans to build an undersea electricity cable from Morocco to the UK. Its hope is that Moroccan solar and wind power can provide 8% of the UK's electricity requirements by 2030. Increasing the size of Morocco's solar and wind power generation could help bolster economic growth in the country, according to the World Bank. It has provided millions of dollars of funding for the sectors. The benefits include a decoupling from the ""very heavy volatility of the prices of fossil fuels"", according to the World Bank's lead economist for the region, Moez Cherif.  In a country with an unemployment rate of 11.2%, Mr Cherif adds that it could create as many as 28,000 much needed new jobs each year.  He also says it would allow Morocco to ""position itself as an industrial hub for investments for exports of green industrial products"" such as car manufacturing using renewable energy. Yet the World Bank estimates that it will cost $52bn (£41.6bn) for Morocco to hit its 2030 renewables target, with most of that money having to come from the private sector. The Moroccan government agrees with that. The administration is acutely aware of the potential benefits, and is trying to accelerate the renewable vision first laid out by King Mohammed VI in 2009. Morocco's Minister of Energy Transition and Sustainable Development Leila Benali says some of the slow growth in renewables in the country in recent years has been caused by global factors. ""The world is just coming out from a historic pandemic, total dislocation of supply chains and value chains - also affecting renewable energy, including the way we trade solar panels and wind turbines."" However, she acknowledges there are also internal hurdles to overcome.  Those include ""speeding up and streamlining bureaucracy"", including making sure companies get things such as ""access to land permits relatively fast to ensure that investors get access to the opportunities that they want"". Mrs Benali adds that the government's energy strategy is based on the three pillars of ramping up renewables, increasing efficiency, and more integration into international energy markets.  When asked if it makes sense to export green electricity before all of Morocco's own needs are met through renewables, Mrs Benali says that the ""priority"" is for Moroccans to have access to the ""lowest-cost"" green energy. She adds that there is also a need to take advantage of the ""historic opportunity"" to integrate with Europe's energy market, and that such opportunities could be an incentive for the much needed private investment.  The World Bank's Moez Cherif believes that Morocco should both increase exports of renewable power, and add more for domestic consumption. ""Ideally you should do both,"" he says. More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade. At last November's COP27 climate change conference in Sharm el-Sheikh, Morocco signed a memorandum of understanding with France, Germany, Portugal and Spain to make it easier to sell power across borders. However, climate change activist Hajar Khalmichi, from the Mediterranean Youth Climate Network, says she wants to see Morocco fulfil all its domestic energy needs from renewables before thinking of exporting any electricity. She also thinks that the ambition of 52% of electricity coming from renewables doesn't go far enough, and that there hasn't been enough discussion about where the rest will come from as Morocco tries to lower its dependency on its gas, oil and coal power stations. Ms Khalmichi adds that she is also concerned that the country is exploring for natural gas off its coastline. The Moroccan government counters that it has similar challenges to other countries that are going big on renewables, and that it needs gas to deal with the fact that the wind doesn't always blow and the sun doesn't always shine. Mr Cherif says ""there may be a role, a transition role for natural gas [in Morocco]"" as the move from fossil fuels to renewables will be a gradual one over the course of decades. Moundir Zniber adds that Morocco needs ""a mix"" of energy sources. ""Renewables are part of the solution on the electric side.""

Volatility,Botticelli painting fetches record $92m at auction,2024-09-25,2021-01-28,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-55839330,"A portrait by Sandro Botticelli has sold for $92m (£67m) at auction, breaking a new record for the Italian renaissance painter. Young Man Holding a Roundel is believed to have been painted in the 1470s or 1480s and is considered one of Botticelli's finest portraits. It sold on Thursday at a Sotheby's auction in New York. The sale marks the first major indicator of the state of the art market this year. Prior to its sale, questions hung over the willingness of global art collectors to pay nine-figure sums for trophy works amid the coronavirus pandemic and market volatility. The successful sale of the Botticelli piece could help boost prices for other such paintings at a time when many art collectors are chasing newer works from post-war and contemporary artists. Sotheby's senior vice president Christopher Apostle described Young Man Holding a Roundel as a ""masterpiece"" ahead of the auction. ""This Botticelli is so much more spectacular in every way than anything we've seen coming to the market,"" he told the AFP news agency. ""This image symbolises and exemplifies the Renaissance in Florence. We haven't seen anything like it in my lifetime,"" he added. The painting shows a man in his late teenage years with long golden hair sitting holding a disc - the roundel - which features a bearded saint with his right hand raised. The roundel is an original 14th Century artwork attributed to Sienese painter Bartolommeo Bulgarini. Sotheby's displayed the painting around the world to collectors and potential bidders in advance of the auction in an effort to increase demand. ""The young man in the painting has done more travel during Covid than probably anybody we know,"" joked Charles Stewart, CEO of Sotheby's. It was displayed in Los Angeles, London and Dubai and accompanied by a catalogue with scholarly essays and technical analysis. The painting sold for $80m (£58.2), but the final price will be $92.2m (£67.1m) when fees and commissions are added. The auction was live streamed from New York and lasted less than five minutes with only two competitors for the painting, according to The New York Times. The selling price establishes the work as one of the most significant portraits to have ever sold at auction. The previous record for a Botticelli was set in 2013 when Madonna and Child with Young Saint John the Baptist sold for $10.4m (£7.6m). Other paintings which have sold for prices in this range include Gustav Klimt's Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer II, which sold for $87.9m (£64m) in 2006 and Vincent Van Gogh's Portrait of Dr Gachet, which fetched $82.5m (£60m) 1990. It is understood Young Man Holding a Roundel has been handed down through several generations of an aristocratic family in Wales for about 200 years. Art scholars were unaware of the painting's existence until it first appeared on the market in the early 20th Century. It has spent much of the last 40 years on public display since its current owner acquired it in 1982 for just £810,000. The painting has appeared at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art, the National Gallery in London and elsewhere. Botticelli, who lived from the 1440s to 1510, is one of the most celebrated painters of the early Renaissance period, but only about a dozen examples of his work survive today. Botticelli was forgotten for centuries after his death, but his work was rediscovered in the 19th Century, and the artist has since become one of the biggest names in art history. His best-known works are The Birth of Venus and Primavera. In 2016, an exhibition at London's V&A Museum, Botticelli Reimagined, explored the artist's enduring impact, particularly on today's pop culture.  The exhibition included a 2009 recreation of The Birth of Venus by photographer David LaChapelle, as well as interpretations of the same painting by Andy Warhol. The front cover of Lady Gaga's 2013 album Artpop also incorporated elements of the The Birth of Venus, and the painting inspired one of the lead singles from the album, Venus.

Volatility,Major economies 'ready to act over coronavirus',2024-09-25,2020-03-03,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51720267,"Finance ministers from the G7 group of nations have said they will use ""all appropriate policy tools"" to tackle the economic impact of coronavirus.  The group of major economies said in a joint statement they were monitoring the outbreak and ready to deploy ""fiscal measures"". It follows warnings the economic impact could tip countries into recession.  On Tuesday, Bank of England boss Mark Carney said the virus could produce a ""large"" but temporary hit to UK growth. Central bankers and finance ministers from Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US held a conference call on Tuesday, led by US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and US Federal Reserve boss Jerome Powell.  ""Given the potential impacts of Covid-19 on global growth, we reaffirm our commitment to use all appropriate policy tools to achieve strong, sustainable growth and safeguard against downside risks,"" they said.  ""Alongside strengthening efforts to expand health services, G7 finance ministers are ready to take actions, including fiscal measures where appropriate, to aid in the response to the virus and support the economy during this phase. ""G7 central banks will continue to fulfill their mandates, thus supporting price stability and economic growth while maintaining the resilience of the financial system."" On Monday, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) warned the global economy could grow at its slowest rate since 2009 this year because of the virus. The influential think tank forecast growth of just 2.4% in 2020, down from 2.9% in November, but it said a longer ""more intensive"" outbreak could tip many countries into recession. There were also sharp falls on global stock markets last week as factory activity in China contracted.   Earlier on Tuesday, Mr Carney told MPs that the virus was ""beyond the containment phase"", before adding the economic effects in the UK could last up to six months. But he said he expected to see ""disruption not destruction"" and added that the Bank was ready to help businesses and households adjust. Mr Carney hands over his role to Andrew Bailey on 16 March, and said the two had been in constant contact in order to have a smooth transition.  Stock markets have rebounded this week amid signs that governments and major central banks will work together to tackle the economic hit of coronavirus. The US Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan have said they are ready to help stabilise markets, after the recent volatility.  And both Australia and Malaysia cut interest rates on Tuesday as a result of the outbreak. The Reserve Bank of Australia cut rates to a record low of 0.5% because of the ""significant effect"" of the outbreak on the country's economy. Malaysia's central bank - Bank Negara Malaysia - cut its rates to 2.5%, saying: ""The ongoing Covid-19 outbreak has disrupted production and travel activity, especially within the region."""
Volatility,Scottish gyms and pools to reopen on 31 August,2024-09-25,2020-08-20,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-53848008,"Gyms, swimming pools and indoor sports courts will be able to reopen from 31 August, Nicola Sturgeon has announced.  The first minister told Holyrood she was bringing forward the reopening of the facilities, which were previously expected to open in mid-September.  She said it meant people aged 12 and over could take part in non-contact activity in places such as dance and gymnastics studios.  Younger children will be able to take part in all activity.  The move has been widely welcomed by the sports and fitness industry which had become increasingly vocal in its calls to allow gyms and pools to reopen safely.  Scottish Swimming said it had shared guidance on safely reopening with pool operators but warned not all of them were likely to reopen on 31 August.  Anytime Fitness, which runs gyms across the UK, said it was delighted but would only allow its Scottish gyms to reopen when they were ""fully compliant"" with government guidelines.  And gym owner Steven McLaughlin told BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime that Ms Sturgeon's announcement was a ""surprise but certainly a welcome one"".  He said they hoped to learn from the gym reopening process in England and they were ready to welcome members back to the studio.  ""That team that we've got can finally all come back together again and we can welcome that family of members,"" he said.  In a statement ahead of First Minister's Questions, Ms Sturgeon said more restrictions were due be lifted on 14 September.  They would see sports stadiums, theatres and live music venues reopened with social distancing, limits on capacity and enhanced hygiene. Indoor contact sports for people aged 12 and over could also return.   And limits on numbers at weddings and funerals could be relaxed - though they would still be subject to some restrictions.  ""However, I must stress these possible changes are at this stage indicative only,"" Ms Sturgeon said.  ""And given the volatility we face in transmission of the virus, there is a very real possibility that these plans will change.""  Ms Sturgeon also announced that police would be given powers to break up and disperse house parties.  She told the Scottish Parliament that 77 new cases of coronavirus had been recorded in the past 24 hours.  ""This is the highest number of daily cases in three months,"" she said.  Twenty-seven of those positive tests can be linked to an outbreak in Coupar Angus, and there were 12 new cases in Grampian, where Aberdeen remains in lockdown.  Ms Sturgeon told MSPs that Scotland would remain in phase three of the lockdown easing process, and that this may not change at the next review in three weeks' time.  For Scotland to move into phase four, she said ministers would have to be satisfied that ""the virus is no longer considered a significant threat to public health"".  And she said the latest figures showed that ""this is definitely not the case"".  The first minister added that the government was not setting a date for the reopening of non-essential call centres and offices.  A full return to office working would significantly increase the risk of transmission, she warned.  ""For now, working from home remains the default position,"" she said.  The impact it would make on community transmission would make it difficult to keep schools open, Ms Sturgeon added.  ""Our priority is to enable children to be safely back at school,"" she said. "

Volatility,Would you want to get paid in Bitcoin?,2024-09-25,2017-12-27,By Ashleigh Nghiem,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42435838,"Bitcoin. Lots of people are talking about, but very few own it.  So how would you feel about getting paid in the high profile cryptocurrency?  From early next year, staff at Japanese internet firm GMO Group will be among the latest to find out how that feels. More than 4,000 employees are being given the option to receive a portion of their salary in Bitcoin. Critics say it is a marketing stunt, announced at a time when global interest in the financial technology has never been higher.  It also carries risks: the volatile currency slumped last week but has since rebounded by more than 50%. But what will it really mean for employer and employee? Bitcoin salaries are usually paid according to the digital currency's value at an agreed date and time. To keep the numbers simple, if the Bitcoin price was $10,000 and an employee opted to have $1,000 in the digital currency, they would receive 0.1 Bitcoin.  Employees who choose to sell right away would receive the same in cash as they would have been paid (so long as they had arranged for the sale to happen in advance).  But holding onto the cryptocurrency, be it for a day, a week or a year, would see its value go up or go down. That $1,000 may end up being worth $5,000. Or potentially next to nothing. And so some argue that paying wages in Bitcoin effectively encourages people to gamble. ""If an employee is receiving their salary in Bitcoin, they might as well be receiving lottery tickets"", said Massimo Massa, professor of finance at INSEAD. ""They are just participating in a game."" Staff must be made aware that ""there's no guarantee that its price will rise and there's no intrinsic value because there's nothing to back it up"", he said, adding such schemes could never be compulsory. Despite repeated warnings from renowned economists and analysts that a Bitcoin crash is looming, it seems more of us are willing to take a punt. Bitwage, a platform set up to convert salaries into cryptocurrency, gained thousands of new users this year as people got swept up in some rapid price rises. ""These days a lot of people are looking to get part, and sometimes all of their salary paid in Bitcoin"", said Bitwage founder Jonathan Chester. The company has this year processed $30m in wages for 20,000 users in the US, Europe, Latin America and Asia including staff from Google, Facebook, GE, Philips, the United Nations and the US Navy. Many of these workers had signed up for the service on their own. Mr Chester said he converts 15% of his own monthly salary and believes it is ""a way of accumulating Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies without worrying about whether you're buying at the right time"".    That is because people can theoretically reduce the risks of volatility because they ""only buy little bits over time"". It is a tricky one to generalise, and it seems inevitable that as the industry develops, so too will the tax rules. Wherever they are in the world, employees will usually be liable for income tax due on their Bitcoin wages, calculated on its value at the time the salary is paid. But just like with stock options, employees may need to pay capital gains tax if their Bitcoin has risen in value, depending on the tax jurisdiction. Some companies working in the cryptocurrency industry have been offering Bitcoin salaries for years.  After all, if you got in early and bought when the price was much lower, then it could be a smart move to use it now to pay wages.  But for others it is all about business strategy. Japan's GMO, for example, says it wants to get staff thinking about cryptocurrencies. It has recently expanded into cryptocurrency trading and crypto mining. And so it hopes that if at least some employees have direct personal experience of Bitcoin, it will help with ""nurturing and developing cryptocurrency literacy"". And that, it says is ""vital to the growth and expansion of our cryptocurrency business"". The digital payment industry is expanding, with new digital currencies emerging all the time.   At the Singapore based blockchain company TenX, staff usually have their base salary paid into their bank accounts, but their monthly bonus is paid in Pay tokens, the firm's own digital currency. The tokens, which can be traded on digital exchanges, were issued in an initial coin offering in June, allowing the company to raise $80m. TenX co-founder and president, Julian Hosp, said it did not make sense to buy Bitcoin to pay bonuses when the company already had its own currency. Paying bonuses in tokens can incentivises staff as Pay's value should rise in line with the company's success, Mr Hosp added. TenX community manager, Mike Ferrer, has gone further and opted to receive part of his base salary in Pay, on top of his monthly bonus. The 32-year-old has been investing in cryptocurrencies for some time, and accepts that there are huge risks, but says he only invests what he can afford. ""I visualise myself throwing in a pile of money and watching it burn in front of me, and if I can't feel comfortable with that then I know I've over invested"", Mr Ferrer said."
Volatility,Oil producers stick to their plan despite Ukraine,2024-09-25,2022-03-03,By Sameer Hashmi,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60591107,"Even though oil prices have surged to ten-year highs, a powerful cartel of oil-producing countries say they will only increase their output by a modest amount.  The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, led by Russia, known as Opec+, will not be turning on the taps. The 23-country-strong cartel will add 400,000 barrels of oil per-day to the market from April.  The group is sticking firmly to an agreement signed by its members in 2021 - to continue gradual restoration of output that was halted during the pandemic. Many countries produced fewer barrels of oil during the pandemic as demand dropped sharply during lockdowns. However, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine the global benchmark contract for oil, Brent crude, has surged to $119 a barrel, driven by anxiety over tighter supply.  Opec+ released a statement attributing the recent rise in prices to market volatility caused by ""current geopolitical tensions"" and stated that there was no shortage of supplies in the market. Separately, members of the International Energy Agency (IEA) have also agreed to release more oil on to the market - 60 million barrels - from their strategic petroleum reserves.  Half of that volume is expected to come from the United States. But the emergency move did little to reassure stock and commodity markets with oil prices rising immediately after the decision was announced. Energy market experts believe oil prices will remain high in the near-term.  Markets are likely to remain volatile because major oil and gas companies, including BP and Shell, have announced plans to exit Russian operations and joint ventures.  According to reports, customers of Russian oil are already facing difficulty over payments and shipping after the West's sanctions were imposed, blocking some Russian banks from global payment systems. ""In the short run, we are looking at a pretty serious run-up in prices. All this uncertainty about Russia, the potential threat of physical disruptions is making the markets nervous"" says Ben Cahill, a senior fellow at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.  Traders suggest oil exporters have been offering Russia's highest-quality oil at a discount over the last few days but found few buyers. Russia is the world's third largest producer of oil, behind the United States and Saudi Arabia. It accounts for 8-10% of global oil supply. Europe relies on Russia for nearly 40% of its natural gas. So, given Russia's crucial position in the global energy market, the US and European Union have, so far, stopped short of imposing sanctions on Russia's oil and gas industries. Analysts say the group's decision to stick to its timetable - a gradual increase in production - has not come as a surprise, given its previous reluctance to deviate from steadily ramping-up output.  Key members of Opec+ may fear that adding more supplies to the market at this stage could lead to an oversupply later in the year. A glut would bring down prices sharply.  Energy experts believe that from the cartel's point of view little has changed yet in terms of physical supply on the market. And that prices have risen in direct response to uncertainty over the invasion. However, there have been some noticeable changes, buyers reluctant to purchase from Russia, for instance, are now switching to similar grades of Middle Eastern oil.  ""Opec+ has always based its decisions on what the current data is showing them, rather than what the data will look like in the future due to geopolitical factors"" says Ahmed Mehdi, Analyst, Renaissance Energy Advisors, an energy research house. There may also be another reason Opec+ members are holding back. Negotiations to revive the 2015 Iran nuclear deal are widely expected to come to a head in March. If sanctions on oil-producer, Iran, are eased, then it could unlock Iranian oil exports.  Mr Cahill believes that the deal could put the brakes on the oil rally, and bring down prices. ""The Iran deal is the wildcard: it could break the price momentum"" he says.  US president Joe Biden's administration, alarmed by rising fuel prices, has been putting pressure on key Opec member states, such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), to turn on the taps, with little success. Russian President Vladimir Putin has also been in touch. During a call with Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan it is thought the two leaders discussed the Opec+ deal and pledged to continue coordination on global energy markets. The response to the Ukraine conflict from the Gulf States has, so far, been muted.  Last week, the UAE, a close ally of the US in the region, abstained during the vote on a draft United Nations Security Council resolution condemning Moscow's actions. Analysts suggest Saudi Arabia and the UAE may be taking a more neutral stance to preserve co-operation with Russia on geopolitical and energy issues."
Volatility,World's shift to clean energy is 'unstoppable',2024-09-25,2023-10-24,By Esme Stallard,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-67198206,"The world is on an ""unstoppable"" shift towards renewable energy but the phase down of fossil fuels is not happening quickly enough, a new report says.  The International Energy Agency, the global energy watchdog, predicted renewables would provide half of the world's electricity by 2030. But it warned that emissions were still too high to prevent temperatures rising above a key threshold of 1.5C. And the report said investment in fossil fuels needed to be cut in half. The Paris-based energy agency's report, released on Tuesday, was not all doom and gloom. It praised the significant progress countries had made in expanding renewable energy and supporting consumers with the shift to electric vehicles and heat pumps instead of gas boilers. The report said the growth in clean energy and technologies was ""impressive"". In 2020, one in 25 cars sold was electric. Just three years later this number has risen to one in five. ""The transition to clean energy is happening worldwide and it's unstoppable. It's not a question of 'if', it's just a matter of 'how soon' - and the sooner the better for all of us,"" said International Energy Agency (IEA) Executive Director Fatih Birol. The report recognised that oil and gas would continue to play a role in the world's economy and that maintaining investment was ""essential"". But it said at the moment, current levels of funding were double what they should be. ""Governments, companies and investors need to get behind clean energy transitions rather than hindering them,"" Mr Birol said.  In what appeared to be a criticism of the UK and other governments' decisions to open new oil fields, Mr Birol added: ""claims that oil and gas represent safe or secure choices for the world's energy and climate future look weaker than ever."" Earlier this year Rosebank oil field off the coast of Scotland was given the go-ahead amidst much controversy. Environmental campaigners argued the decision was not compliant with the UK's climate change plans. But Claire Coutinho, the government's minister for energy, said at the time: ""[The government] will continue to back the UK's oil and gas industry to underpin our energy security"". A spokesperson for the Department of Energy Security and Net Zero said in response to the IEA report that the independent Climate Change Committee recognised oil and gas would continue to be part of the UK's energy mix on the path to net zero. The world's reliance on fossil fuels means that we are still on track to be facing a global average temperature rise of 2.4C by 2100. That compares with the pledge made in 2015 when political leaders agreed on limiting temperature rises to ""well below"" 2C and to make every effort to keep it under 1.5C, to avoid the most dangerous impacts of climate change. World leaders will meet in Dubai at the end of November for COP28 - the UN climate summit - where it is hoped further commitments to tackling climate change will be made, including potentially agreeing to phase out ""unabated"" fossil fuels. Abatement refers to technologies, which are not yet available at scale, that could capture the emissions released when fossil fuels are burned. The IEA report also reflected concerns about the Middle East. The agency said it was not yet clear what impact rising tensions would have on world energy markets. But the IEA warned that it meant further uncertainty compounding an already unsettled global economy - Middle Eastern countries, such as Iran and Saudi Arabia - account for 67% of world oil reserves. The report drew parallels with the 1973 oil crisis when Arab oil producers imposed an embargo in response to Western support for Israel in the Yom Kippur war against Arab states led by Egypt and Syria. As a result petrol prices skyrocketed, with knock-on effects on inflation and high unemployment. The IEA said that this time around the world is also facing the impact of volatile gas prices. The UK increased its imports of LNG following the invasion of Ukraine to reduce its reliance on Russian gas and 14% of the UK's gas is now supplied as LNG from Qatar. But the agency hoped the establishment and expansion of solar and wind energy will provide a long term solution to energy volatility."
Volatility,Rwanda policy unlawful and 'radical' NHS overhaul,2024-09-25,2023-06-30,By BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-the-papers-66061474,"The government's planned shake-up of the NHS gets front page coverage from many of Friday's papers.  The Daily Telegraph says Prime Minister Rishi Sunak will today unveil the ""most radical"" reform of the NHS in its history - including measures to create an army of junior and apprentice roles, and speed up clinical training. Writing in the paper, Steve Barclay, the health secretary, says the plan constitutes ""the most radical modernisation and reform of the workforce since the NHS was founded in 1948"".  The Times says that after years of wrangling with the Treasury, the NHS has got almost everything it asked for. Sunak's allies tell the paper that a big expansion of auxiliary roles will benefit patients next year. However, the paper adds, he faces questions about how the plan will help a health service struggling with record waiting lists. The Daily Mail leads with the prime minister's robust response to a ruling by the Court of Appeal that government plans to send asylum seekers to Rwanda are unlawful, describing it as ""Rishi's blast"". The paper predicts the case will take months to resolve, increasing the likelihood of ""immigration and human rights becoming key battlegrounds in the run-up to the next election"". The Metro says the plans have been thrown out ""yet again"" by the courts and that Sunak's personal pledge to ""stop the boats"" is in jeopardy. ""Grounded Hog Day for Rishi"" is its headline. The Daily Telegraph quotes a government source saying ministers were ""positive"" about their chances in an appeal - if one is granted. In an editorial, the Times says Sunak can't wait with fingers crossed for the outcome of an appeal to the Supreme Court and needs a plan B. The Guardian says the Tories risk a bitter legal feud in their bid to fight the ruling.  The i leads on the volatility facing mortgages, warning of a ""snowball effect"" as lenders try to avoid offering the cheapest deals because they can't cope with the surge in demand. It reports that borrowers are scrambling to get the least expensive home loans before they suddenly disappear - with mortgage brokers warning of future rapid rate hikes. British households withdrew £4.6bn from bank accounts last month, the highest level since monthly records began in 1997, according to the Financial Times. The paper says the data, published by the Bank of England, suggests consumers are either shopping around for higher interest rates or tapping into their savings to pay their bills.  The front page of the Daily Mirror carries a picture of a letter to the prime minister, written by a seven-year-old girl called Poppy, asking him to provide free meals to all primary school children - an issue on which the Mirror campaigns. ""If you don't have much money you can't have food. If you don't have food your brain won't learn,"" it reads. The paper says it's ""time to fork out""."
Volatility,Oil suffers biggest drop in two years,2024-09-25,2018-07-11,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44802143,"Oil prices suffered steep falls on Wednesday after Libya said it would boost supply, even as investors fear that trade tensions will hit demand. Brent crude dropped 6.9% - the biggest decline in more than two years - to end at $73.40 a barrel for the global benchmark. US crude fell 5% to $70.38 a barrel - its worst one-day decline in a year. The declines followed a months-long rally that had increased prices to some of the highest levels in recent years. However, oil prices have been volatile in recent weeks after the US said it would reinstate sanctions against Iran, a major producer. Wednesday's sell-off started after the announcement by Libya's National Oil Corp that it would reopen four export terminals that had been closed since late June, shutting most of the country's oil output. The falls came despite a US government report that American crude oil stockpiles fell by more than 12 million barrels last week and are about 4% lower than average for this time of year. OPEC president Suhail Al-Mazrouei said volatility in oil prices was not desirable: ""Fluctuation is not good and we do not like to see lots of fluctuation in the prices."" Economists are worried that escalating trade tensions between the US and China will hurt the global economy, lowering demand. On Tuesday, the US unveiled a list of $200bn worth of products to be hit with 10% tariffs, prompting China to vow counter-measures. The back-and-forth followed tariffs on $34bn of each country's goods that went into effect last week  While fallout from those measures is expected to be relatively limited, that could change if the fight continues. China was the world's biggest oil importer last year, followed by the US."
Volatility,Bank forecasts worst UK growth since 2009,2024-09-25,2019-02-07,By Ben Morris,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-47155537,"The Bank of England expects growth this year to be the slowest since 2009 when the economy was in recession. It is forecasting growth of 1.2% this year, down from its previous forecast of 1.7% made in November.  The Bank said it had seen further evidence that businesses were being cautious in the run-up to Brexit, including evidence from its own survey of firms. As expected the Bank kept interest rates on hold at 0.75%. The Bank put the fall in growth down to a decline in business investment and housebuilding, as well as a halving of the growth rate in exports. The UK was also being hit by slower-than-expected growth in the eurozone and China, the Bank said in its Quarterly Inflation Report. ""Growth appears to have slowed at the end of 2018 and is expected to remain subdued in the near term,"" it said. The Bank even sees a one-in-four chance of the economy slipping into recession in the second half of this year. There has been an ""intensification"" of Brexit uncertainties, the Bank said. Its survey of 208 firms showed that half had started putting plans in place for a no-deal Brexit. The survey also showed that a fifth had taken on extra warehouse space It also noted a sharp fall in business investment at the end of last year. ""Uncertainty appears to have risen recently, and may have weighed on investment by more than had been expected in August,"" the Bank said. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said: ""The fog of Brexit is causing short term volatility in the economic data, and more fundamentally, it is creating a series of tensions in the economy, tensions for business."" Interest rates remain at 0.75%, where they have been since the Bank of England last raised in interest rates in August. Many economists think that once the uncertainty over Brexit is lifted then the economy will accelerate and the Bank will have to raise interest rates to stop it overheating. However, recent economic data has indicated weakness in the UK economy. Growth in the service sector, the biggest part of the economy, appeared to have stalled in January, according to closely-watched survey of purchasing managers. Samuel Tombs, an economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, predicts that the Bank will raise rates once this year and twice in 2020. Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said: ""We still think that a decent rebound in GDP growth, should a Brexit deal be reached, will result in interest rates rising further than the Bank and the financial markets assume."" Moves in interest rates are important to the 3.5 million people with variable or tracker mortgages. Even a small rise of 0.25% can add hundreds of pounds to their annual mortgage costs. ""It's a very good time for people looking to borrow,"" said Andrew Montlake, a director at Coreco, a mortgage broker. He said there had been a lot of competition among lenders in January, with some very good deals for five-year fixed mortgage deals. Some lenders are offering five-year fixed deals at below 2%, he said. Concern over Brexit has held back some people from borrowing. ""There is a lot of pent-up demand,"" said Mr Montlake. Savers who depend on higher interest rates to boost their incomes will be disappointed that rates have stayed on hold for a sixth consecutive month.   While the Bank cut its growth forecast it also noted the strength of the labour market, where the unemployment rate is currently 4%. The rate at which people are switching to new jobs is only slightly below the level hit before the financial crisis of 2007. That switching suggests that employers are having to compete to attract staff, the Bank said. It also noted a pick-up in the average number of hours worked at the end of last year and firmer wage growth. The Bank thinks that wage growth will increase in the coming years as the UK's unemployment rate continues to fall. The main reason the Bank thinks underlying inflation pressures will grow is that wage growth will rise. Britain's unemployment rate has hit its lowest level in more than 40 years.  The Bank predicts that earnings will rise by more than 3% a year over the next three years."

Volatility,Brexit issues 'may shut offshore platforms',2024-09-25,2018-09-10,By Kevin Keane,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-45474989,"Oil and gas platforms could have to be shut down if a deal on Brexit leads to difficulties accessing skilled workers, according to an industry report. The warning comes in Oil and Gas UK's latest economic report. It said delays in accessing labour markets from EU countries have the potential, in some instances, of leading to production being shut in. The UK government said employers could continue recruiting from Europe up until 2020. The report said about 5% of workers in the UK oil and gas sector come from other EU countries. That figure rises to seven percent for the offshore workforce. The report said it was ""vital that arrangements are in place between the UK and EU to allow the continued frictionless movement of people"". One example related to emergency response vessels stationed close to platforms, which require skilled engineers to operate. The report said that if difficulties arose in recruiting replacements then platforms would have to shut down operations and production. To minimise the impact of Brexit, Oil and Gas UK said it was vital that the UK government secured frictionless access to markets and labour, maintained a strong voice in Europe for the industry, and protected the internal energy market. The 2018 Economic Report revealed that oil prices in the first half of the year were 30% higher than 2017, averaging more than $70 per barrel. Along with the continued drive to bring down costs, that was estimated to have created more than £10bn of free cash flow. But it said investors ""will continue to favour a conservative outlook"" because of the continued volatility of the oil price. Chief executive Deirdre Michie said: ""Industry is emerging from one of the most testing downturns in its history. However, the steps that have been taken by industry, government and the regulator have delivered tangible results. ""Despite the improvements seen in recent years, we find ourselves at a crossroads. Record low drilling activity, coupled with the supply chain squeeze, threaten industry's ability to effectively service an increase in activity and maximise economic recovery. ""The UK Continental Shelf (UKCS) is a more attractive investment proposition - our challenge now is to take advantage of this. ""We have to drive an increase in activity while continuing to find and implement even more efficient ways of working which support the health of supply chain companies whilst also keeping costs under control."" The report said the cost of producing oil had halved since its peak and was now averaging around $15 per barrel. This has followed an industry-wide drive to bring down costs and extend the life of the UK sector. A spokesman for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: ""The oil and gas industry is crucial to the UK's economy and energy security. That's why we are providing a £2.3bn support package of measures. ""EU citizens make a huge contribution to the oil and gas industry and we've provided certainty to the industry that employers will be free to continue recruiting from Europe up until 2020."""
Volatility,Covid worries help Bitcoin to three-year high,2024-09-25,2020-11-18,By Justin Harper,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-54982604,"Bitcoin, the world's best-known cryptocurrency, has jumped above $17,000 (£12,800) to hit a three-year high. The digital currency has suffered plenty of wild price swings since it was launched in 2009. But investors have been flocking to cryptocurrencies during the pandemic-driven volatility on global stock markets. However, experts have cautioned about viewing them as a ""safe haven"". On Wednesday, Bitcoin had climbed more than 7% to $17,891, its highest level since December 2017. Some analysts said the Covid-19 pandemic has encouraged investors to reassess the long-term outlook for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. But there are still concerns about the fraudulent trading in cryptocurrencies following a succession of high-profile hacks. During times of volatility, investors tend to move their money out of shares and into what are considered safer havens, like cash and gold. Some feel cryptocurrencies are now being viewed as a shelter from stock market volatility. ""Covid-19 has disrupted the traditional safe-haven trade and gold's inability to outperform. Periods of extreme risk aversion have forced many traders to diversify into Bitcoin,"" said Edward Moya, at trading firm Oanda. One attraction of Bitcoin is its limited supply, which is capped at 21 million. Some feel this scarcity provides an innate value and shields Bitcoin from inflation, which is becoming a worry. But Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy and chief economist at AMP Capital, warned about jumping into Bitcoin. ""Its huge volatility hardly makes it a safe haven as a store of value. I have far more confidence in the $50 note in my wallet retaining its value over time than Bitcoin, which seems to bounce around like a yo-yo."" Last month, PayPal announced that its customers will be able to buy, sell and hold Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies using their PayPal accounts, allowing customers to buy things from the 26 million sellers which accept PayPal, it said. Next year, PayPal plans to allow cryptocurrency to be used as a funding source. But Oanda's Mr Moya warned traders to prepare for more volatility. ""The amount of hedge funds and high-frequency trading systems driving Bitcoin higher will likely deliver exaggerated moves once its price nears the $20,000 level,"" he added. ""Traders need to expect $1,000 swings in a matter of minutes.""   Some believe the recent rise in Bitcoin is partly driven by the ""fear of missing out"" (FOMO).  ""Its rebound is creating more interest from speculators and so they are jumping in which then pushes it even higher,"" added Mr Oliver. ""I think most people would put more faith in a digital currency run by their government rather than one like Bitcoin that they have trouble understanding or explaining."" China is one such country working towards launching its own government-backed digital currency - known as Digital Currency Electronic Payment (DCEP). One trader, Jon Son, told the BBC: ""I think more people are beginning to buy Bitcoin first not to miss the rise and then research into what exactly Bitcoin is."""
Volatility,How PM Modi misread the mood of India's farmers,2024-09-25,2021-01-13,By Soutik Biswas,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-55630394,"After more than 45 days of protests and eight rounds of talks with the government, India's farmers have refused to budge. Nothing short of a repeal of three market-friendly farm laws - designed to loosen rules around the sale, pricing and storage of farm produce - will make the farmers retreat from protest sites ringing the capital, Delhi. On Tuesday, the Supreme Court, responding to a bunch of petitions, put the laws on hold. The uncertainty lingers. So why did Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government fail to anticipate the blowback to the laws and misread the public mood in the affected states of Punjab and Haryana? Were they lulled into complacency because a Punjab-based ally initially supported the laws? (The Akali Dal later reversed its stand and quit the government.) Did the government believe that the laws would not lead to any significant erosion of popular support? Mr Modi has built a reputation for tough talking and playing hardball with his critics and his party is widely believed to have its ears to the ground. Protests had been brewing in Punjab even before the laws were ratified in the parliament in the middle of the pandemic last September. Angry farmers had squatted on railway tracks in protest. In late September, the regional Akali Dal had walked out.   So why was Mr Modi caught on the wrong foot by what has now grown into arguably the world's biggest protest? One reason, many believe, is that Mr Modi has not faced a mass movement against his regime. A protest by the influential Patel community in Gujarat in 2015 demanding quotas in government jobs lingered on for four years before a resolution. A months-long protest led mostly by Muslim women in a Delhi neighbourhood against the controversial Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) was cleared last March amid measures to curb the spread of coronavirus. But none were as large and intense as the ongoing protests, and did not challenge the government in the way the defiant farmers have.  ""I don't think Mr Modi misread the situation because he had no knowledge about the protests in Punjab. I think the overconfidence arose from his inexperience in dealing with mass protests,"" says Prof Parminder Singh, a civil rights activist. Second, the current protests are significantly different from similar agitations in India's history. In colonial India, peasant revolts against exploitative rulers often turned violent. Since Independence in 1947, farmers have staged demonstrations against falling crop prices, indebtedness and farm distress. But none have seen the staggering levels of cohesion and mobilisation - involving some 40 farmers' unions, more than half a million protesters, and large swathes of civil society - as the ongoing agitation.  The protests have originated in Punjab, the relatively prosperous farming heartland of India. Along with its neighbour Haryana, the two states have benefited most from India's farm policies. These farmers are now frustrated over stagnant and falling farm incomes and fear that entry of private businesses will hurt their future. The protests have now widened to coalesce around a range of anxieties over farming in India - shrinking plots of land, diminished produce, volatility in crop prices, and centralisation of lawmaking in a country where farming matters are mainly entrusted with the states.   ""The protest is more than an arena of grievances,"" Pratap Bhanu Mehta, professor of political science at Ashoka University, told me. ""It's also about a lack of trust in the government and an assertive articulation of federalism.""  At the protest sites, the mood is one of unbending resistance against the government. ""People here are calling it a revolution for our rights,"" Surmeet Mavi, one of the editors of Trolley Times, a daily newsletter published from the protest site, told me. ""It's a feeling of fearlessly taking on the powerful government."" For decades, the dominant stereotype of the Indian farmer has been one of a semi-literate, struggling man, who tirelessly ploughs the land. The reality is that India's 150-odd million farmers are of different kinds - the big and small; the landed and the landless. So when it was reported that the protesters were having pizzas, there was some unkind social media chatter about whether these people really worked on the farms. It laid bare, again, how little urban Indians know about their rural brethren. What Mr Modi's government and many people have possibly failed to understand is that many of the protesting farmers have deep linkages with urbanity.  Many of them have children in the army and police, speak English, use social media and have both travelled and have relatives abroad. The protest sites are well organised with clinics, ambulances, kitchens, facilities, libraries, and even its own newspaper. Like most urban protests, there's the risk of the media-fuelled spectacle overtaking the underlying complexities of the agitation. ""This farmer movement speaks the language of middle-class India. They are saying they are patriotic, and fighting for the rights they hold dear,"" says historian Mahesh Rangarajan. This is also not a conventional protest against farm distress or drought, which most governments have been successful at managing. This agitation is ironically a consequence of Punjab's success in farming - the state is the biggest beneficiary of government-guaranteed prices of wheat and rice, and elaborate state-supported marketing structures.  These have now become a millstone around Punjab's neck - a glut of two crops has led to overflowing stocks, stagnating incomes and depleting groundwater. ""The challenge is that Punjab has been unable to transition from a largely well-to-do farming society to one where there is environmentally sustainable agriculture and industrialisation,"" says Prof Mehta.  More than 85% of India's farmers are small and marginal, and they work on some 47% of the total farming land. Both the government and farmers agree that farming needs reform. But they cannot agree on specifics. ""There are solutions. But the farmers don't trust the government,"" says Prof Mehta. And therein lies the real problem."
Volatility,North Korea gears up for 'biggest military parade',2024-09-25,2020-10-08,By Laura Bicker,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-54459248,"North Korea is preparing for what is expected to be the largest military parade in its history. Thousands of soldiers have practised for months to ensure that each step is marched with precision and each fervent cry of adoration will be heard by the Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un. These events are often ostentatious formal displays of military might to show a devoted people paying homage to their leader in closely directed goose-stepping drills. Mistakes are not tolerated. But these parades can also be part provocation. A chance to show off new missiles and weaponry despite being under strict economic sanctions. The state has not featured any ballistic missiles in its parades since Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un held their first summit in 2018.  Talks between the two sides broke down in Hanoi last February without a deal and North Korea has continued to test a number of new short range ballistic missiles.   This event, on 10 October, to mark the 75th anniversary of the founding of the Workers' Party comes just weeks before the US presidential election. So is North Korea going to use it to make a point and prove that it still has weapons capable of striking the United States? It's certainly going to be big, according to the editor-in-chief of the Daily NK, a Seoul-based website with paid sources in the North.  Lee Sang Yong told me that as early as March, Pyongyang had ordered its military to mobilise 32,000 soldiers. It's become so large that the site where soldiers practise has had to be expanded. ""The Pyongyang Mirim airport now has two new roads and 10 new buildings. Therefore, I think it is likely that we will see Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles [ICBMs] or Submarine Launched Ballistic Missiles [SLBMs] on display at the parade this time,"" he said.  ""Also, 600 students and researchers from Kim Il-sung University will also take part. This is not an insignificant number. This university is where they develop new talent for missile development. By bringing them to the parade or putting them on display, North Korea may be trying to install pride and respect for the missile development talents."" Jeongmin Kim, an analyst with NK News, said North Korea does not always use these events to prove a point to the outside world. ""We have to remember that many times - for a hereditary dictatorship especially - they constantly have to prove legitimacy to rule to their domestic audience.  ""So 10 October will also aim to do exactly that: trying to show its people, with dazzling parades with uplifting propaganda slogans, that they are 'doing okay', despite all of what has been going on this year.  ""Of course, precedents do point to the possibility of Kim Jong-un or other high-level officials making a speech that may involve some message aimed at the outside world, such as how they are not waiting around for sanctions relief any more and will focus on 'self-reliance'."" While some will be watching for any new missiles on display, there is growing concern about the welfare of the 25 million North Korean people. 2020 has been a bad year for most countries, but for North Korea it has the potential to be devastating. ""I hear there is a surge in the number of orphans and homeless street kids in the North this year,"" said Lee Sang Yong. ""Even though we cannot even imagine it here in South Korea - there are people in the North who are dying and starving."" The state closed its borders to the outside world in January to prevent an outbreak of Covid 19 spreading from neighbouring China.  Authorities have reportedly issued ""shoot-to-kill"" orders along the border and created a buffer zone to stop anyone entering the country.  Diplomatic sources told me earlier this year that stockpiles of PPE and other essential medical supplies, including vaccines, had built up at the border with China, unable to get through. North Korea claims to have had no cases of Covid-19, but Kim Jong-un continues to hold high-level meetings to ensure tight restrictions remain in place. The North Korean people are now cut off from the outside world more than ever before. Even movement between provinces has been limited. ""Land, sea, and air. It's a complete shutdown of both people and material,"" said Mr Lee.  ""Unless you are military personnel or a high-ranking officer, no one is moving inside of North Korea. Quarantine measures against Covid-19 are so tight. ""The North Korean economy has come to a halt. Smugglers and small traders at the border have questioned why the regime is risking the fate of the economy if there is no Covid-19 in the country."" Six months' training for 10 minutes on parade Trade with its key ally China has plummeted by nearly 70% in the first eight months of this year, as compared to last year.  The impoverished state has also been battered by extreme weather in recent months and Korean state television spends its afternoons showing ""heroic"" efforts to overcome the damage from several typhoons. Kim Jong-un has now ordered a nationwide drive to try to boost the ailing economy, describing it as an ""80-day battle"".   In short, that means more work for the North Korean people, extra hours in the fields or factories and additional duties in their towns and villages. The harder they struggle, the more loyal they will seem to local leaders. The message blasted across state TV is one of ""self-reliance"". In the South, farms across the country are busy harvesting rice. But it's hard to know if this is happening in the North. It's difficult to get a clear picture of how badly the state's harvests have been hit, but with 11 million people in the country thought to be food insecure, even a small number of rain-ravaged fields can amount to thousands going hungry. My team travelled to the Demilitarised Zone near Geosong on the east coast. We drive past white sandy beaches flanked by high barbed wire. Bright blue skies give us a crystal clear view of the mountains to the north. A few checkpoints are visible on the peaks From here, curious South Koreans love to peer into the North. This is as close as they can get. Pyongyang dramatically cut off all communication with Seoul in June and blew up the inter-Korean liaison office Earlier this month an incident in disputed waters to the west of the peninsula saw a South Korean man, thought to have been trying to defect, shot and killed. His body was burned.  It shocked South Koreans. And yet the North still has friends here. Some still harbour hopes of ending the 70-year war even after Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un could not reach a deal on denuclearisation. Just three years ago, North and South Koreans competed together at the Winter Olympics in Gangwon province and the local governor believes it's time to look again at these types of exchanges as a path to peace. ""The effort to reach a big deal resulted in no deal. It is time for us to go back to develop non-political initiatives and to achieve small deals in sport and cultural exchanges,"" said Choi Moon Soon. ""It is very unfortunate that we are left with the situation that even small exchanges between North and South Korea are cut off by pursuing the political big deal and revealing differences in the process."" Mr Choi would like to create a United Nations peace zone at the border.  International sanctions mean this is an unlikely dream for now. Instead Mr Choi acknowledged that North Korea is keeping a close eye on the US presidential election to figure out its next move. ""I am not sure if I will see North and South Korea unified in my life time but I have two daughters and I would like it if they didn't inherit this volatile situation. We live with continuing threat and potential of conflict. We shouldn't pass down this volatility to our next generation."" That may be out of his hands and instead fall to whoever wins the White House. Pyongyang is trying to read the situation inside and outside its country. It's not yet clear which path it's willing to take.  Will its current perilous predicament eventually encourage Kim Jong-un back to the negotiating table. Or will he look further inward and keep the borders closed. The North Korean leader has been unusually quiet this year. This parade is a chance to show his hand and his agenda and put the fate of his country back into the public eye."
Volatility,Electricity customers to be consulted on tariffs,2024-09-25,2023-02-22,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-guernsey-64722469,"Electricity customers in Guernsey have been asked about potential tariff changes, due to the ""volatility of the global energy market"". Guernsey Electricity (GE) said it was looking to increase the standing charge by 65%, and put up the price of heating homes using electricity by 13%.  It said it was also asking customers for views on changing the tariffs for people with air source heat pumps.  A two-week consultation has been launched. The company has asked customers for their views because of ""the volatility of the global energy market following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022."" One proposal set out in the consultation is an increase in the customers' standing charge, from £30 to £49.50. Another is to freeze the price people can sell electricity generated at their homes home back to the grid at 9.9p pKWH.  Chief financial officer Karl Brouard said: ""Although local customers have been relatively insulated from the types of rises seen in the UK as a result of our forward price setting strategy, we are not immune from the wider geopolitical impact."" ""We realise that this comes at a time when the cost of living for everyone is increasing, but we cannot let these changes delay the planned investment in the network and the need to maintain the security of electricity supply."" Mr Brouard added the island was ""facing increases in the cost of imported energy, together with a rise in the cost of on-island generation at the power station"". The results of the consultation will feed into the final tariff application made to the States Trading Supervisory Board (STSB), which has the responsibility to assess and approve tariffs. Last year, the STSB approved an application to allow GE to increase its tariffs to raise revenue by 9%.  The Environment and Infrastructure Committee said a new electricity strategy was to be debated before the end of March 2023, having previously said it would be in December 2022.  Committee president Lindsay de Sausmarez said work was ""progressing well"" on the strategy, with an aim to publish a policy letter on it ""by the end of March 2023"".

Volatility,Sports Direct profits more than halve,2024-09-25,2017-07-20,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-40665459,"Profits at Sports Direct have plummeted nearly 60%, which the retailer said was largely due to the weaker pound. The slide in sterling means the firm has had to pay more for its imported goods, and its underlying pre-tax profit fell to £113.7m from £275.2m. However, chief executive Mike Ashley said trading at its new ""flagship"" stores was going well.  Sports Direct's reputation has been badly hit by revelations about staff conditions at its Derbyshire warehouse.  Chairman Keith Hellawell said the company had made ""positive progress"" across the business as it continued to ""strive to ensure that all of our people are treated with dignity and respect"". A recent survey of workers in Shirebrook, to which 3,300 people responded, had showed that an ""overwhelming majority"" of people in the warehouse ""currently feel they are treated with respect"", he added. Staff had elected the company's first UK workers' representative and Mr Hellawell said he had ""no doubt"" their ""contribution will prove invaluable to the board as the Sports Direct family continues to move forward together"". Sports Direct, which has been without a chief financial officer since last October, also said it had appointed Jon Kempster to the role. Mr Kempster is set to join the company on 11 September.  Mr Ashley said Sports Direct was trying to ""conservatively manage the currency volatility that is reflected in our full year results"". Sports Direct imports many of its products from abroad and the pound's fall against the dollar had led to a ""significant fall in profits"", he added. However, he said the company had now put in place hedging arrangements to ""minimise the short-term impact of currency volatility"". The company's key strategy is to turn itself into the ""Selfridges of sport"", and Mr Hellawell said the ""elevation of our retail proposition continues to be a key objective"". Sports Direct said it was forming a ""new strategic partnership"" with sportswear firm Asics. The Japanese company will manage dedicated areas within Sports Direct's new upmarket ""premium"" stores.  Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said this had been a ""transformational"" year for Sports Direct.  Progress was being made on the new premium stores, he said, and they were ""a lot more profitable than the existing Sports Direct stores"". The retailer's shares rose by 6% following the release of the results as investors appeared to welcomed the progress it was making to move upmarket.   In recent months, Sports Direct has bought 26% stake in Game Digital, increased its stake in Debenhams, acquired lingerie firm Agent Provocateur and snapped up the US sports clothing and outdoor equipment chains Bob's Stores and Eastern Mountain Sports.  The company's ""spending spree on acquisitions"" had affected profits, Mr Wilson said.  ""That's something to bear in mind when we're looking at these figures and also what that does is it puts Sports Direct in a better position to make a strategic move in, for example, the department store area or in the US with its US acquisitions."" It doesn't look good on paper. But for analysts watching the company this seems like the beginning of the end of a difficult period for Sports Direct.  Financially, it's now protected against a further drop in the pound. Better late than never.   Reputationally, the damage it suffered from its alleged Dickensian treatment of workers is being addressed with a worker on the board of the company.   It's smartening up its shops and restating its goal to be the ""Selfridges of sport"".  The monkey isn't quite off its back. Chief executive Mike Ashley is still facing a court case about a £15m pub bet, which is generating colourful headlines.  But as the chairman ends his statement by saying, Sports Direct has been a big contributor to the UK economy with thousands of jobs and billions in tax. "
Volatility,Retail sales jump on Black Friday deals,2024-09-25,2018-12-20,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46630865,"Retail sales jumped more than expected in November, helped by Black Friday promotions and stronger growth in sales of household goods. Official figures showed sales rose 1.4% from October, despite economists' forecasts of about a 0.3% gain. But for the three months to November, which smoothes out monthly volatility, sales growth was 0.4% on the previous quarter, the slowest rate since April. Several retailers have warned of tough trading this winter. Sports Direct boss Mike Ashley said November was ""unbelievably bad"", while Superdry and online retailer Asos have also warned of dismal trading. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the changing nature of Black Friday sales promotions posed a challenge for the process of adjusting for seasonal variations. Household goods sales leapt by 5.3% on the month in November, the biggest increase since the end of 2013 and driven by an 11% increase in electrical appliances. Online sales as a proportion of all retailing exceeded 20% for the first time, the ONS said. Surveys from the British Retail Consortium and Barclaycard have suggested that households were continuing to shop cautiously in November. However, recently consumers have seen the fastest growth in underlying pay growth since 2008, with inflation falling to a 20-month low of 2.3%, according to ONS figures released earlier this week. Thomas Pugh, UK Economist at Capital Economics, said the stronger spending could point to a weaker December, but that the longer term trend was more positive. He said: ""With inflation continuing to fall back... and pay growth on the up, there should be scope for consumer spending growth to gather some momentum further ahead. [The] big picture is that a continued acceleration in real earnings, assuming a Brexit deal is signed, should give household spending a boost next year."" Philipp Gutzwiller, head of retail at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, said November data showed that ""online is now truly coming of age"".  He added: ""More than perhaps any month before, the fact that overall sales rose in November was thanks to the relative success of Black Friday online compared with on the High Street."" The most recent high street and shopping centre footfall data for November, compiled by Springboard, showed the worst decline since the recession. It turns out Christmas came early - but may not have been quite the bumper gift that some retailers were anticipating. Black Friday is increasingly a fixture in the festive shopping calendar, shifting Christmas spending from December to November.  The ONS, which produces the retail figures, smooth them out to allow for seasonal patterns, but their adjustment process may not have yet caught up with what is still quite a new phenomenon.  So, the ""adjusted"" increase in the amount of goods sold between October and November may appear stronger than it should. And it's clear that shifting more goods in November came at a heavy price for retailers such as Asos, which had to discount heavily to keep up with competitors, damaging profits.  Beyond the November headline, the underlying trend in spending is slowing - growing by 0.4% over the last four months. That's the weakest rate since April, and doesn't bode well for retailers or the economy as a whole.  And if Christmas shopping is happening earlier, December could disappoint. Indeed, a survey from CBI points to weakest growth in sales this month for over a year."
Volatility,Cutting energy prices will take years - power boss,2024-09-25,2022-12-04,By Jonathan Josephs,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63834755,"It ""will take years"" to get energy prices back to pre-Ukraine war levels, the boss of one of the world's biggest energy firms has told the BBC. Enel's Francesco Starace said bringing prices down depends on new sources of energy such as renewables and heat pumps. Governments across Europe are spending billions helping business and households afford energy bills. They are also scrambling to secure new supplies.  Mr Starace said the company, which produces and distributes electricity and gas, tried to shield its 20 million European customers from energy market volatility this year. It did its best to stick to the fixed-price contracts it had agreed, he said. Breaking customer trust would inflict greater damage on the firm than a hit on one year's results, he said. The Italian energy giant sells power to more than 70 million homes and businesses in over 30 countries. But Enel is planning to leave many of those countries as it focuses on renewable energy and becoming carbon neutral by 2040. It also wants to cut its huge debts of around $63bn (£52bn). It is investing heavily in making solar panels as it expands an existing factory in Sicily and builds a new one in the US.  Soaring energy prices have been the biggest contributor to inflation and the cost of living crisis in the UK, the US and the Eurozone. The global energy crisis triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine ""showed very clearly how dependence on one single source of energy is dangerous for Europe"", Mr Starace said. The future will be ""extremely decarbonised"" and depend on nuclear and renewable energy, he said. However, that shift to renewables also has risks. In July, the International Energy Agency warned that China's dominance of the solar industry creates ""potential challenges that governments need to address"".  Mr Starace said the West has been over-reliant on China for renewables and other goods. ""Some rebalancing needs to be happening because it is unhealthy,"" he said, when asked about geopolitical tensions interfering with energy supplies.  This has helped drive Enel's investment in solar panels, although the expansion of the Sicilian factory will still meet only 10% of Europe's needs, he said. Political leaders have also acknowledged that Europe needs to get its energy from more places. According to the European Council on Foreign Relations, the EU and its member states have signed 56 energy deals with 23 countries this year. Among the latest was a 15-year deal for Germany to get liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Qatar through a contract with ConocoPhillips. Norway is also boosting natural gas production and the world's biggest producer, the US, has been pumping out record amounts. This means the chances of Europe repeating its dependence on Russia with another country are ""quite low"", according to Megan Richards, a former director of energy policy at the European Commission. ""A lot of work has been done"" to replace Russian energy, she added, before warning: ""I think Europe will not be completely domestically independent for a very, very long time, if ever"" even though ""renewables will increase dramatically"".

Volatility,Mortgage deals withdrawn in record numbers,2024-09-25,2022-09-28,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63061534,"Lenders withdrew a record number of mortgage products overnight, according to analysts, as they grappled with the prospect of rising interest rates. Moneyfacts, a financial information service, said that 935 mortgage products, around a quarter of the total, were taken off the shelf. Interest rates are expected to rise sharply following the government's tax-cutting mini-budget on Friday. Economists are predicting that could lead to a 10-15% drop in house prices. The cost of government borrowing has risen sharply since Friday and the Bank of England has signalled it will raise interest rates at its next meeting in November. That in turn will raise the cost of borrowing for banks and building societies offering mortgages. As a result lenders are withdrawing mortgage deals in order to re-price them. Moneyfacts said the fall in mortgage products on offer was the biggest daily drop it has ever recorded. It was double the previous biggest drop, which occurred at the height of the Covid pandemic. A total of 2,661 mortgage products are still available - but that is half the number that were on sale at the start of December last year when interest rates started to rise.  Brokers are reassuring those who already have a mortgage, or an agreement for a new mortgage, that they will be unaffected for the time being. However, when they come to remortgage, they are likely to find monthly repayments have become a lot more expensive. When Usman Ahmad, his wife and two children moved into their house four years ago they thought it would be their ""forever home"". But he is worried that higher interest rates may mean they can no longer afford to stay there. When the family bought their house in Manchester in 2018, they fixed the mortgage at 2.05% for five years with monthly payments of £927, Mr Ahmad said.  Usman, a 33-year-old self-employed courier, said if he took out a fixed rate mortgage today he would be facing monthly payments of more than £1,250 a month. ""I'm thinking if that's now, what are the rates going to be like in nine months' time when I have to take out a new deal?"" On top of rising energy and food prices, the higher borrowing cost could be the last straw, he said.  ""I'm worried about defaulting on the mortgage and losing the house,"" Usman said.   Rachel Springall, from Moneyfacts, said: ""Borrowers would be wise to keep calm over the current volatility in the mortgage market and seek the advice from a independent broker. Various lenders have been very vocal that their decision to withdraw products is a temporary measure, amid the uncertainty over interest rates.  ""Those looking to remortgage may find they have more equity in their home amid rising house prices, but first-time buyers may be struggling to find a property they can afford."" However, mortgage brokers are reporting a high number of calls from buyers hoping to lock in deals as soon as possible. They are warning that if the rates on offer climb too high buyers could pull out. Ray Boulger, at mortgage adviser John Charcol, told the BBC that rising rates would have a big impact on the ability of people to buy, and would deter some people from buying at all. ""A key factor in house prices is how much people could afford on their monthly mortgage,"" he said.  Investment bank Credit Suisse has published analysis predicting that ""house prices could easily fall 10%- 15%"". The house price ""correction"" would be gradual, over the next 18 months approximately, Credit Suisse added, as most people have fixed-rate mortgages that don't need to be renewed immediately. Andrew Wishart, senior property economist at Capital Economics, also predicted a sharp fall in house prices of up to 15%. ""The rise in market interest rates that has already happened will push up mortgage rates to at least 6% and reduce the size of loans that lenders can offer,"" he wrote. ""The resulting drop in buying power makes a significant drop in house prices inevitable."" What have been your experiences of trying to secure a mortgage since the summer?

Volatility,Protests erupt in El Salvador as Bitcoin crashes,2024-09-25,2021-09-08,By Katie Silver,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-58459098,"Angry protests, technological glitches and a plummet in value marked the first day of El Salvador adopting Bitcoin as legal tender. The price of Bitcoin on Tuesday crashed to its lowest in nearly a month, falling from $52,000 (£37,730) to under $43,000 at one point.  An opposition politician said the fall caused one of Latin America's poorest countries to lose $3m.  The rollout of bitcoin in El Salvador was far from what President Nayib Bukele would have envisaged when he began his bold experiment.   Platforms such as Apple and Huawei weren't offering the government-backed digital wallet, known as Chivo, and servers had to be pulled offline after they couldn't keep up with user registrations.  But, as the day went on, Chivo began appearing on more platforms and was accepted by the likes of Starbucks and McDonald's.   The government has even given Salvadorans $30 each of Bitcoin to encourage its adoption.  It says bitcoin could save the country $400m a year in transaction fees on funds sent from abroad.  However, using data from the World Bank and the government, the BBC calculates this to be closer to $170m. ""We must break the paradigms of the past,"" President Bukele tweeted. ""El Salvador has the right to advance towards the first world."" Ed Hernandez runs a family shop in San Salvador where customers buy essentials like rice, beans and cleaning products.  He's well and truly on board.  ""During the pandemic, it will be nice not to use physical cash,"" he told the BBC, adding that it protects him from customers paying with counterfeit notes.  What wasn't good timing for El Salvador though was the tumble Bitcoin took on its first day as legal tender, falling 20% at one point.  ""It was a very bad day for President Bukele, his government and his Bitcoin experiment,"" opposition politician Johnny Wright Sol told the BBC.  ""The majority of the population knows very little about cryptocurrencies. What we do know is it's a very volatile market. Today that was surely made manifest.""  Mr Wright Sol said Bitcoin was not an apt national currency and was rushed through: ""The Bitcoin law was approved in parliament with hardly any debate. It took only about five hours to go through.  ""We're not cryptocurrency or Bitcoin haters, but we don't believe that it should be compulsory that businesses should be obligated to accept Bitcoin in payment.  ""The state is backing these payments and assuming the risk but at the end of the day us taxpayers are all the state."" Mr Wright Sol isn't the only critic.  More than 1,000 protesters gathered outside the country's supreme court, where fireworks were set off and tyres were burnt.  Beyond financial instability, some say the adoption of Bitcoin may fuel illicit transactions. But Mr Hernandez, the shopkeeper, is not put off by the volatility:  ""I see it as a risk yes - but like everything in life, there's a risk. When we own a shop, sometimes we buy a product and we don't sell it. ""When others see a crisis though, I see an opportunity."" "
Volatility,The impact of trade tariffs on two US firms,2024-09-25,2018-07-30,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45011587,"New trade tariffs are raising costs for US businesses, testing their power to pass on the expenses to consumers.  US equipment maker Caterpillar on Monday said strong demand had allowed it to hike prices to offset $100m-$200m in higher steel and aluminium costs. But while higher prices are shielding some firms, others are under strain. On the same day, food processor Tyson Foods cut its profit forecast, saying retaliatory duties on US pork and beef exports had lowered US meat prices. It said it expects adjusted earnings per share in the range of $5.70-$6 for its 2018 financial year due to a surplus in US supply caused by the tariffs. That was down from its earlier $6.55-$6.70 forecast. Lower prices for beef and pork have also reduced demand for chicken, the firm added. ""The combination of changing global trade policies here and abroad, and the uncertainty of any resolution, have created a challenging market environment of increased volatility, lower prices and oversupply of protein,"" said Tom Hayes, Tyson Foods president and chief executive officer.  The updates were the latest from businesses explaining how trade disputes are raising costs and shifting demand for products that range from cars to beer. In March, the US announced tariffs on steel and aluminium, prompting China, the European Union, Mexico and other places to retaliate with import taxes on US products such as pork, wine and whiskey. Separately, the US and China have also imposed tit-for-tat tariffs of $34bn on the other country's goods, in a row over intellectual property practices and state subsidies. While some firms, including Caterpillar, have said they will pass on higher costs to consumers in the form of higher prices, others are more constrained. BMW, for example, has said it would raise prices in China by 4%-7% on two SUV models, which are US-made. But the rise will not completely absorb the cost of China's new taxes on US vehicles, the firm warned. Harley Davidson told investors it plans to shoulder the cost of European tariffs on US-made motorcycles in order to remain competitive. It is also grappling with higher steel and aluminium prices. Overall, analysts expect the duties to have a relatively modest impact. Analysts at US bank Wells Fargo estimate that the US tariffs so far will boost inflation in the US by 0.1%, but said that the rise could be softened by price declines for products targeted by other countries for retaliation. The changes come as higher fuel and labour costs fuel stronger inflation in the US. The index for producer prices climbed 3.4% over the 12 months to July, the strongest annual gain since November 2011, according to figures from the US Labor Department. The consumer price index increased 2.9% over the 12 months to June. With wage growth still relatively slow, economists say it's not clear how many increases households can handle before they reduce spending."
Volatility,Two electricity companies increasing prices by 30%,2024-09-25,2022-04-29,By John Campbell,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-61272589,"Two Northern Ireland power companies, SSE and Budget Energy, have said they are raising their electricity prices by about 30%.  The increases will affect three in 10 households in Northern Ireland, or about 248,000 domestic customers.  SSE tariffs will rise by 33% from 1 June while Budget prices will go up by 27% from 27 May. The price rises had been expected after rival firm Electric Ireland announced a 30% increase last month. Electric Ireland's higher tariffs will take effect on Sunday. High and volatile prices on global wholesale energy markets are being blamed for the increase. The Consumer Council has said the latest increase will see the SSE standard tariff for credit meter and pay-as-you-go customers increase by £248 to just over £1,000 a year.  It said Budget Energy's typical customer with a credit meter will see their bill rise by about £280 a year and about £275 for pay-as-you-go customers. These could have a significant impact on many household budgets. It was expected because one of the rival companies, Electric Ireland, announced a 30% increase just last month and in fact that increase will take effect from this weekend. Behind all of this is the continuing volatility and high prices on global energy markets, which is key for generating electricity. Unfortunately, there is very little sign of the gas prices moderating in the year to come. Stormont has already run two schemes to help lower income households - there was a £200 payment which went to many benefit claimants, that was a £55m scheme, and there was a smaller scheme which paid £100 to households who were in real immediate distress. Peter McClenaghan, of the Consumer Council, said the price increases were the latest bad news as the cost of living continues to rise in Northern Ireland.  ""While consumers get that these price increases are happening due global reasons, it doesn't make it any easier for people to pay their bills, particularly those in vulnerable circumstances,"" he said.  ""If you are struggling to pay your bills, the first thing to do is contact your supplier directly for help and information. There are measures that can be put in place to help you.  ""Unfortunately, prices are set to stay high for the foreseeable future so the Consumer Council will continue to push for significantly improved initiatives to help consumers who are experiencing payment difficulties."""
Volatility,Gas crisis leaves Europe searching for solutions,2024-09-25,2021-09-23,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-58650634,"A surge in gas prices has hit consumers and energy firms in the UK, with knock-on effects for the food industry and supplies of carbon dioxide. Elsewhere in Europe, consumers are also facing a steep rise in energy bills, and governments are scrambling to help. The crisis has highlighted the difficulty for Europeans in funding the move to renewable energy. Here, five correspondents explain how different countries are responding. Consumers' bills have spiralled here in recent months, with the cost of electricity increasing 35% over the last year and nearly 8% in August alone. Energy prices in Spain are closely tied to the wholesale gas market, so the price per megawatt hour for consumers has repeatedly hit new highs recently.  ""I was paying about €40 (£34) per month and now I'm paying around €60,"" said Amparo Vega, who has a newspaper kiosk in central Madrid.     Earlier this month, the coalition government of Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez unveiled a series of measures aimed at bringing bills back down.  They include tax cuts and a temporary reduction in extraordinary profits made by energy companies. The latter move has drawn criticism from the industry, although the government has clarified that renewable energy providers will be exempt.   The government says its aim is to reduce electricity bills by over 20% by the end of the year. As winter approaches, consumers such as Ms Vega hope that happens. ""The outlook isn't very rosy,"" says Michele Fiorita, taking some air outside his shop in central Rome. ""My energy bills have gone up by about 15% but I've heard they'll rise by around 40% in the next few months."" Italy is particularly exposed to gas price hikes: 40% of its energy comes from natural gas and around half of that is imported from Russia.  So lower Russian gas exports to Europe and an increase in the price of raw materials have hit hard.  The Italian government has already spent some €1.2bn to cut the increase in energy prices for households and this week pledged another €3bn to help further in the coming months.  Prime Minister Mario Draghi says for the next three months ""system costs"" will be eliminated from gas and electricity bills. They're the tariffs added to bills to help fund the transition to renewable energy. It's a short-term sticking plaster to help reduce the jump in energy prices for struggling households but removes an important financial incentive to help the switch to renewables.  Fundamentally, Italy will need to diversify its energy sources, moving away from its dependence on gas and more towards green energy. ""That's surely the future,"" says Michele, ""it's the only way to reduce costs in the long-term."" As soaring energy costs present huge personal difficulties for families, they also pose some tricky politics for Brussels.  EU leaders have been busy pushing their sweeping climate plan to cut carbon emissions by 55% by 2030 - a drive known as ""Fit for 55"". It's wide-ranging but includes proposals that, critics say, could lead to huge further price hikes.   Even backers of the measures quietly admit the transition to a greener economy inevitably, one way or another, hits people in the pocket. On the current crisis, the European Commission says that price rises are a combination of several factors, particularly the global surge in demand.  Increases in the price of CO2 permits under the EU's carbon pricing scheme are blamed for some of the rises, but the Commission says it's only a ""small percentage"". It wants to expand that scheme under ""Fit for 55"".  But with calls from the Spanish government for the energy crisis to be on the table at the next EU leaders' summit, Brussels is facing questions over what it can or will do to help.  Guidance is being worked on in terms of the mitigation measures member states can individually take within EU rules. But there's no sign of any significant, centralised intervention.  The more the crisis heats up, the greater the backlash may be over the EU's climate plans. However, those in favour would argue that the faster the move to a green economy, the faster member states can escape this kind of volatility.   Surging European gas prices have been felt by Polish consumers because the country's energy regulator has approved three price hikes this year, raising bills by more than 20%. But household gas bills are still regulated here, so customers are insulated from any sharp changes in market prices. Also, about half of Poland's gas demand is met by domestic production, which is typically cheaper than imported gas.  That cheaper, domestic gas is used to cover the needs of households first, while industry is mostly supplied with more expensive imports. But here again, energy-intensive Polish companies are shielded from sky-rocketing market prices because they have long-term supply contracts with a fixed price.  In Poland, coal is still the main fuel driving the economy, with gas a long way behind. That is starting to change.  The solar power market is one of the fastest growing in Europe and state-controlled power companies are planning huge investments in offshore wind.  Gas will become more important then, because the government sees natural gas as a bridging fuel to replace ageing coal plants and ensure the lights remain on when the wind drops under cloudy skies.  In Poland, the origin of the gas is a political issue. The government plans to cease its decades-old dependence on Russian gas next year and replace it with US and Norwegian gas, arguing it will no longer suffer Gazprom overcharging it for gas, because it can abuse its position as a monopoly supplier. POLAND'S COAL: The vast European mine infuriating the neighbours Non-EU Norway is one of the biggest producers of oil and natural gas in Europe, though very little of it is used for its own needs. Only 1.4% of electricity is produced by burning fossil fuels and waste, 5.8% by wind power and the remaining 92.9% is produced by hydroelectric power.  Norway's Equinor energy company has agreed to allow a 2bn-cubic-metre increase in gas exports for the next year to support increased European and UK demand. Formerly known as Statoil, Equinor is two-thirds owned by the state.  While bills are not as high as elsewhere in Europe, Norwegians are not immune from increasing energy prices. ""We currently pay 750 NOK (£63) a month for energy and warm water, but in Oslo prices are relatively low,"" says Magnus, 26, who lives in a studio apartment in the capital with his girlfriend. The couple are moving to a bigger flat in Bergen on the west coast and expect their bills to go up: ""When you live somewhere where fewer people are, then electricity is more expensive. That's why I'm thinking of just getting solar panels."" From 1 October, Norway will be able to export electricity to the UK via a ""North Sea link"" of underwater high-voltage electric cables connecting the two power grids. There have been concerns the recent UK price surge could spread to Norwegian households and industries. But one proposal to impose a tax on outgoing energy has been rejected, as Norway also needs to import energy in certain periods of the year."
Volatility,US suggests Russia could be behind gas pipe leaks,2024-09-25,2022-09-29,By Jonathan Josephs,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63084613,"The US has said it ""seems"" Russia is to blame for this week's leaks in the Nord Stream gas pipelines. US Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm told the BBC an investigation was being carried out into the cause of what she called ""an act of sabotage"", adding ""it is highly unlikely that these incidents are coincidence"" No evidence about how the leaks happened has been made public. Russia has dismissed suggestions that it was to blame. It said claims it had damaged the pipelines were ""stupid and absurd"". President Putin described the damage as ""unprecedented sabotage, in fact, an act of international terrorism"" during a phone call with Turkey's President Erdogan, according to the Kremlin, which added Russia plans to bring it up for ""urgent discussion"" at the UN Security Council. Earlier Russia's Foreign Ministry suggest it was the US that stood to benefit from the pipeline being out of action because it would be able to increase its own natural gas sales. The White House has dismissed such suggestions. ""It's probably most likely some form of sabotage,"" according to Mike Fulwood of the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies. ""If there was one incident of a pipeline rupture of leak then accidental damage could be a possibility, it is very rare. ""The most likely cause of accidental damage is an anchor being dropped and dragging across the pipeline"". He added that with multiple leaks in a short period of time ""doesn't sound like it could be accidental, although theoretically it could be"". The high water pressure at the bottom of sea makes a detonation difficult, according to energy engineering expert Professor Russell Johns of Penn State University.  He says ""it is not likely that the Russians detonated their own pipeline. They could have simply cut-off gas to the pipeline entrance"" if they wanted to stop supplies. The money Russia continues to receive for its fossil fuels is helping fund its invasion of Ukraine.  The gas escaping from the pipeline near the Danish island of Bornholm has been in the pipe since the beginning of September when Moscow closed it off, saying repairs were needed to a vital artery in supplying Europe's energy needs.  Ms Granholm suggested the energy relationship between Russia and Europe was being consigned to history. ""I think Russia has proven itself to be an unreliable energy partner,"" she said. ""No country wants to take the risk of putting a significant amount of its energy demand to Russia's supply. I think this accelerates the EU's push to become energy independent through clean energy"". The war in Ukraine has had a profound impact in pushing up global energy prices. They've been the biggest contributor to soaring inflation in the UK, Eurozone and US, something which is threatening to reduce global economic growth. The increasing cost of living has made political leaders around the world re-evaluate where they get their energy from, according to Ms Granholm, who was speaking from the International Atomic Energy Agency's Ministerial Conference in Vienna. ""Every country is looking at the risks associated with putting too many eggs in one basket or putting too many eggs in the basket of petro-dictators and the volatility of the fossil fuels that accrue from that. Everyone is looking to how they can become energy independent."" Wind, solar and nuclear energy are among the alternatives many countries are trying to increase as they also aim to meet the Paris climate change targets. However an analysis by Columbia University suggests that Russia has a 46% share of global enrichment capacity for nuclear fuel, and the International Energy Agency warned in July that China has an 80% share ""in all the key manufacturing stages of solar panels"". When asked how the US and others don't end up overly reliant on such alternatives Ms Granholm replied that ""this move to clean energy could be part of a great peace plan"" and that such a move ""helps people's pocketbooks, helps the economy, and helps energy security"". This year's steep increases in the price of oil and gas have benefitted the energy giants who get them to consumers. In the first half of this year the combined profit of five of the biggest western energy firms, BP, Shell, Total, Chevron and Exxon almost tripled to just over $95.2bn with much of it going to shareholders. Ms Granholm said President Biden's administration wanted to see such companies lower prices at petrol pumps ""so that citizens are not hurting"". Despite acknowledging that oil is traded on a free market she called on them to help, ""at least the American companies as good American citizens"" and warned they could face a windfall tax similar to what has been seen in the UK. ""We don't want that huge amount of profit to end up triggering consequences, either Congressionally or elsewhere, that will not be in their interest. ""We want them to be responsible and not be buying back shares instead of increasing production, production that would ultimately reduce prices because of increasing supply. We are looking at legislative tools as well as otherwise pressuring them."" One other way the US could help increase the supply of oil to global markets is by lifting some of the sanctions imposed on Venezuela by President Trump. The South American country has the world's largest oil reserves but has been exporting minimal amounts of oil because of the restrictions. They were enacted because of alleged corruption and the political fallout from 2019's contested election.  An increase in supplies would be likely to push down global oil prices. When asked if it was time to lift the sanctions, Ms Granholm didn't dismiss the idea, replying: ""I'm not going to get ahead of the White House on that.""

Volatility,Universities warn of going bust without extra cash,2024-09-25,2020-04-09,By Sean Coughlan,https://www.bbc.com/news/education-52237664,"Universities across the UK are calling for emergency funding of at least £2bn, warning some institutions will go bust without it. Universities UK says the coronavirus pandemic is threatening to sharply cut overseas student numbers and put universities in financial danger. They are asking for controls on student numbers in each university, to keep fee income at similar levels to last year. Universities are promising to honour any offers already made to students. ""Without government support, some universities would face financial failure, others would come close to financial failure and be forced to reduce provision,"" says a letter from higher education leaders to ministers across the UK. Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK, says the proposals would help universities to ""weather the very serious financial challenges posed by Covid-19"". He says academic researchers have made a ""huge contribution"" to tackling the coronavirus pandemic - and their expertise will be needed in the ""recovery of the economy and communities following the crisis"".  They are calling for an extra £2bn in research funding and on top of that to provide emergency loans for universities that faced ""significant income losses"". ""Targeted support"" should be available to protect strategically important subjects such as science and medicine, say the industry leaders. This would be in response to cash pressures from the pandemic: There have been warnings of unprecedented ""volatility"" in this year's admissions - which, if left unchecked, could see some universities expanding but others left with too few students to be financially viable. This is a particular risk for universities in England and Wales, which are highly dependent on tuition fee income. In response, Universities UK is asking for controls on the number of students each university in England and Wales can recruit this year, keeping them to levels expected before the coronavirus outbreak, to stop financially unsustainable swings in numbers. The scale of concern was suggested in an internal email from a Russell Group university seen by the BBC this week, which warned the university could lose a quarter of its income next year. The letter from Universities UK to ministers says that to provide ""stability"" for students currently applying, all offers already made would have to be honoured if students made the required grade. There is also a call to push back by a year the point at which European Union students are categorised as overseas students, when they will face higher fees and visa restrictions. Jo Grady of the UCU lecturers' union said the plan was a ""piecemeal approach that fails to recognise the size of the problem, or the damage we risk doing to our academic capacity"". Eva Crossan Jory, vice president of the National Union of Students, said any extra funding must support students, ""especially considering the mounting discontent that courses are not being delivered as promised and demands for refunds"". She backed calls for the government to ""step in"" to protect higher education, but said it should include ""refunding or all or part of the fees"". ""The scale of the financial challenges facing higher education institutions are clearly very serious"", said Scotland's Deputy First Minister John Swinney. He promised to work closely with universities to help them ""emerge from this crisis"". A Welsh government spokesman said universities had been ""at the forefront of the battle against the coronavirus"" and ministers would work to ensure they had the ""necessary investment"". In England, a Department for Education spokeswoman said: ""The outbreak poses significant challenges to the sector and the government is working closely with universities to understand the financial risks and implications they might face at this uncertain time."""

Volatility,JP Morgan sues Tesla for $162m after Musk tweets,2024-09-25,2021-11-17,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-59306199," JP Morgan Chase is suing Tesla for $162m (£121m) over tweets in 2018 by boss Elon Musk that he could take the electric car maker private. The bank accused Tesla of ""flagrantly"" breaching a deal it claims should have triggered payments to JP Morgan. Mr Musk's notorious tweets that he had funding to take Tesla off the New York stock market sparked volatility in the share price. He later abandoned the move and was fined by the US financial regulator. JP Morgan's suit, filed in a Manhattan federal court, says the companies had an agreement signed in 2014 that allowed the bank to buy Tesla shares at a set price and date. Under the deal, Tesla sold so-called warrants to JP Morgan allowing the bank to purchase shares if the ""strike"" price was below Tesla's share price when the warrants expired in June and July 2021. ""We have provided Tesla multiple opportunities to fulfil its contractual obligations, so it is unfortunate that they have forced this issue into litigation,"" a spokesperson for JP Morgan said in a statement. JP Morgan said the warrants contained standard provisions that allowed it to adjust their price to protect both parties against the economic effects of ""significant corporate transactions involving Tesla,"" such as an announcement the company was going private. Mr Musk's tweeted on 7 August 2018 tweet that he might take Tesla private at $420 per share and had ""funding secured"". He scrapped the plan 17 days later. Tesla's share price rose approximately 10-fold by the time the warrants expired this year, and JP Morgan said this required Tesla under its contract to hand over shares of its stock or cash.  Failure to do so, said JP Morgan, amounted to a default. Tesla has yet to comment publicly on the bank's lawsuit. But the company said in 2019 when news of the dispute emerged that JP Morgan was being ""opportunistic"" to take advantage of the share price volatility. Mr Musk is an enthusiastic and frequently controversial user of twitter, and now has 64 million followers.  Only this month the billionaire caused a stir when he asked his followers in a twitter poll whether he should sell 10% of his Tesla shares. The vote was 'yes'. His 2018 tweets on taking Tesla off the stock market led to charges from the powerful US regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission, for misleading the market. Mr Musk vehemently denied the charges, but eventually agreed a settlement that led to him stepping down as chairman of the carmaker. He and Tesla paid $40m in penalties."
Volatility,Dairy farmers told to cut milk supplies,2024-09-25,2020-04-09,By Kevin Keane,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-52233147,"The dairy manufacturer Muller has ordered farmers across Scotland who supply them with milk to cut production because of an oversupply.  It has written to more than 250 dairy farmers asking them to reduce output because of changing consumer habits caused by the coronavirus crisis. It has been estimated more than a million litres of unwanted milk is being produced across the UK each day. This means some dairy product is having to be poured down the drain. Even though demand from supermarkets has increased, that has not filled the gap left by the closure of cafes and restaurants. Dairy farmer Ian Burgoyne from Crocketford, near Dumfries, said: ""To have to do this after months and years of planning, large amounts of investment, it is a heartbreaking situation."" Muller has asked all dairy farmers to reduce their output by 3%. It has suggested various ways this could happen such as feeding whole milk back to calves or retiring some cows from the herd early. But there is also concern about the capacity to return to full production when lockdown conditions ease. A spokesman for Muller said: ""The Covid-19 pandemic has severely impacted the market for milk. We are asking farmers to temporarily reduce milk production by 3%. ""While supplying farmers will continue to receive their full contracted price, we hope that this collaborative approach will prevent the need for further and more serious measures."" Graham's Dairy has not restricted farm output but has admitted some milk has had to be thrown away. Owner Robert Graham said: ""We're working hard to find alternative uses and alternative capacity across UK for our product and we've been able to do that to some degree. ""Nobody wants to see waste but it's the volatility. It's the changes in customer behaviour and so much of the food service sector currently being closed."" Robert Hunter, from the Scottish Dairy Cattle Association, says margins are so tight for milk producers there is no wriggle room. He added: ""A lot of dairy farmers won't be able to ride this storm out. Because things have been so tight for so many years we have tightened everything down that we possibly can."" Dairy farmers have long complained that supermarkets undervalue milk and sell it too cheap.  The milk mountain is now pushing the price down further with some analysts saying those without a contract to supply it are finding that their milk is worthless."
Volatility,Fake Walmart news story boosts crypto price,2024-09-25,2021-09-13,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-58545944,"Cryptocurrency Litecoin saw a sudden surge in price on Monday over a press release about Walmart accepting it for payment - which turned out to be fake.  The release, published through a legitimate press channel, claimed that Walmart would accept the currency through all its digital stores.  Walmart later told US media outlets the announcement was ""inauthentic"". By that time, several major news websites and press agencies had spread the supposed news.  The announcement made it on to Globe Newswire, a service widely used to distribute press material from companies.  The faked release has since been deleted, and did not appear on Walmart's own website. A tweet from a verified Litecoin Twitter account linking to the release has also been deleted. Hours later, the Litecoin Foundation tweeted that it had no such partnership. But while it was being reported as fact, the price of Litecoin jumped from about £125 per token to close to £170, before falling back near its original price, at about £128.  Globe Newswire said ""a fraudulent user account was used to issue an illegitimate press release"". ""This has never happened before,"" the company said in a statement - adding that it was bringing in ""enhanced authentication"" to stop it happening again. It did not detail exactly what went wrong or who was behind the fake release.  But so called ""pump and dump"" schemes are not uncommon in the cryptocurrency world - where bad actors attempt to raise hype around a coin, inflating its price, and quickly sell off their own stock before the market corrects itself. The false press release suggested that Litecoin would be accepted on all Walmart ecommerce platforms from 1 October.  It contained quotes that appeared to come from both the Walmart chief executive and the founder of Litecoin.  One clue to its nature was that a press contact email address pointed to a web domain which had been registered only last month. Emails to that address bounced as undeliverable. The fabrication was unmasked when CNBC reached representatives of Walmart by phone and were told the press release was fake. CNBC said it had been among the news organisations to publish the story before discovering it was not true.  Walmart, the Litecoin Foundation, and Global Newswire have been contacted for comment. The announcement raised eyebrows among some sceptical observers because of the volatility of cryptocurrency prices, which can be an obstacle in using them for retail purchases.  Other companies which have accepted Bitcoin have drawn up terms to limit their exposure to large price swings.  For example, when Tesla briefly accepted Bitcoin as a payment option for its cars, it made clear that the price was in US dollars - and that any quote in equivalent Bitcoin was only valid for a limited time window.  It also said that if a refund was needed, Tesla would have the choice of whether to pay it back in US dollars or Bitcoin, which may work out as a lower cash value than what was paid.  Similarly, PayPal recently introduced the ability to buy and sell Bitcoin - but it cannot be used to make payment purchases. Instead, the cryptocurrency assets will be sold for the right amount of real money to make the purchase. "
Volatility,"Scotland to get 500,000 fewer Covid vaccine doses",2024-09-25,2021-03-18,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-56442322,"Scotland is to get 500,000 fewer vaccine doses over the next month due to UK supply issues. However, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the country remains on track to meet its targets despite the shortfall. UK ministers have faced calls to explain why there would be a significant reduction in incoming vaccines from the end of March.  It is partly due to a delay in a delivery from India of five million Oxford-AstraZeneca doses. Ms Sturgeon told MSPs: ""We expect that over the next month we will have approximately 500,000 fewer doses than we had previously anticipated. ""For that reason there may be periods in April where we need to prioritise second doses."" Second doses should be administered within 12 weeks of a first dose. Ms Sturgeon added that the government still intends to offer first doses to all people in the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) top priority groups by mid-April. This covers everyone aged over 50, unpaid carers and people with underlying health conditions. The first minister said she ""still expects"" to offer a dose to all adults in the population by the end of July. She added: ""We have always known that supplies will be subject to some volatility but the roll-out of the programme overall continues to be really encouraging and it does give us real cause for optimism now about the months ahead."" Earlier, Scotland's national clinical director told Holyrood's Covid-19 committee that targets should be met despite a ""significant reduction"" in UK vaccine supplies. Professor Jason Leitch said ministers may have to think about ""who comes next and when they come next"" after April.  He added: ""We do not anticipate it will affect our second doses at all because we can prioritise them and just now they are mainly Pfizer."" Prof Leitch said there is no suggestion from either Pfizer-BioNTech or AstraZeneca that they will not be able to meet their end targets. The national clinical director has made it clear that disruption to the vaccine supply will not affect two key targets. All those over 50 or with underlying health conditions should still get their first jab by mid April, and the whole of the adult population should still be offered a jab by July. One big question is when people in their 40s with no underlying health conditions - who may have been assuming they would be vaccinated in mid to late April - will now get their jab. Another is whether disruption to the supply will have any effect on the easing of lockdown. As the plan was to vaccinate over-50s by mid April and it takes three weeks for someone to get as much protection as one dose offers, it would seem unlikely that there will be any effect on the changes planned for 5 and 26 April. But will progress be sufficient to allow other restrictions to ease in May and June as hoped? The groups who will be vaccinated by mid-April account account for 99% of Covid deaths and the overwhelming majority of hospital admissions. But with a growing amount of evidence that vaccination also reduces transmission, immunising younger people will also play a part in keeping case numbers down and providing even more protection to those most at risk. It will be well worth watching the numbers in the coming weeks.   The UK government said neither a single factory nor a country was responsible for the expected slow down. Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick told the BBC that UK supplies would be lower ""than we might have hoped for in the coming weeks"", but this was expect to increase in April. Prof Adam Finn, a member of the JCVI, said the supply issues meant efforts would focus on the first phase of the programme to vaccinate the over 50s. Second doses for those immunised earlier in the year would also be prioritised The Bristol University academic told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland that phase two - to vaccinate the remaining adult population - would move forward when supplies were restored. Prof Finn said: ""We have seen this in the past with other vaccines. Because they are biological agents rather than straightforward drugs they are more difficult to manufacture at scale. ""So we always try and make sure that we have got more than one supplier for vaccination against any particular disease."" Prof Finn said the issues should only result in a ""partial interruption"" to UK's vaccination programme and said it remains ""on track"". The Scottish government said that ""appointments will be fulfilled"" for anyone already scheduled to have their first dose or second dose.   A spokesman added: ""Supplies of the vaccine have dipped before and our vaccination programme will continue to manage the stock available to get vaccines into arms as fast as possible."" On Wednesday it was announced that more than two million people in Scotland had received their first dose of the vaccine. The Scottish government said the milestone meant that 44% of the eligible population had been reached. Latest vaccination figures reveal 2,023,002 had received their first dose of the vaccine - an increase of 41,184 - as of 08:30 on Thursday. A total of 192,100 people have so far received a second dose of the vaccine, an increase of 10,221. That means 51,405 received vaccinations on Wednesday."

Volatility,Review calls for independent regulator,2024-09-25,2021-11-24,BBC Sport,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/59406087,"This video can not be played Independent regulator will strengthen English football - Tracey Crouch MP English football needs an independent regulator to stop it ""lurching from crisis to crisis"", says the chair of a fan-led review into the sport. Former sports minister Tracey Crouch is calling on the government to create a new independent regulator for English football (IREF). The review says this is necessary for the long-term financial stability of the men's professional game. ""This is a huge opportunity for football,"" Crouch told BBC Sport. ""We've seen football lurching from crisis to crisis over the past decade and unfortunately we haven't had the right levels of regulation in place to stop that from happening."" BBC Sport understands that Downing Street will support the plan for an independent regulator. Speaking to BBC sports editor Dan Roan, Crouch added that the recommendations were to remove ""vested interests"" from football to ensure it can ""become sustainable for the long-term future"". The review, which was commissioned by the government, also recommends Premier League clubs paying a ""solidarity transfer levy"" to further support the football pyramid. It suggests clubs should have a 'shadow board' of fans so they are properly consulted on key decisions and that supporters hold a 'golden share' to protect their clubs' heritage and which competitions they play in. The review also proposes new owners' and directors' tests and that these are carried out by IREF instead of the Premier League, English Football League (EFL) and the Football Association (FA). Crouch said she is ""absolutely confident"" that such measures would stop any revival of the failed European Super League or a similar breakaway competition and would prevent a club going bust in the manner Bury FC did in 2019. She added she is ""extremely optimistic"" the government will support the idea of an independent regulator but said legislation will not be in place by the start of next season. However, she said a 'shadow regulator' could be set up 'straight away' to establish the guiding principles for IREF. The Premier League said it recognises the need to ""restore and retain"" the trust of fans in football governance and that it will study the recommendations before working with the government, fans, FA and EFL on these issues. The EFL said it hopes the review is a ""catalyst for positive change that can make clubs sustainable"". The FA said ""many positive changes have already been made"", some of which were ""directly as a result"" of the review. The Football Supporters' Association (FSA) said the review ""lay the basis for a prosperous and sustainable future"" for English football at all levels. The report makes 47 recommendations, which are summed up in 10 major points: The government should create a new independent regulator (IREF) IREF should oversee financial regulation in football IREF should establish new owners' and directors' tests A new corporate governance code should be set up Equality, diversity and inclusion plans should be mandatory for all clubs Supporters should be consulted on all key off-field decisions through a 'shadow board' Key items of club heritage should be protected by a 'golden share' for fans There should be more support from the Premier League to the pyramid through a solidarity transfer levy, paid by Premier League clubs on buying players from overseas or other top-flight clubs Women's football should be treated equally and given its own review Stakeholders should work to increase protection of welfare of players leaving the game The Premier League's owners' and directors' test has come under scrutiny recently following the Saudi Arabian-backed takeover of Newcastle. Amnesty International has urged the league to change the test to address human rights issues, with the Saudi state accused of human rights abuses. The Premier League said it has ""legally-binding assurances"" the Saudi state has no direct control over Newcastle, despite the Public Investment Fund (PIF), which has an 80% stake, being chaired by Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman. Western intelligence agencies believe the crown prince approved the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, which he denies. The review did not state whether human rights issues would be considered in the new proposed tests but did say owners and directors must be of ""good character"" to pass. Crouch said she did not know if the new tests would have blocked the Newcastle takeover but added they would have ensured ""greater transparency"". The Premier League and EFL agreed a £250m rescue package for EFL clubs in light of the Covid-19 pandemic in December last year, before the top flight made another £25m available to Leagues One and Two and the National League last week. The review says the proposed transfer levy will add to that and work in a similar way to stamp duty, external in order to ""distribute revenues across the pyramid and into grassroots"". Crouch said the Premier League ""has a duty"" to pass more of its wealth down - but that both it and the EFL need to come to a decision on what the levy percentage should be. If they cannot agree, she said IREF will make the decision on their behalf. Football fans protested outside stadiums following the announcement of the European Super League in April The review heard more than 100 hours of evidence from fans representing more than 130 clubs, the FA, Premier League, EFL, League Managers' Association and Professional Footballers' Association. The government promised a fan-led review in its 2019 general election manifesto after Bury were expelled from League One following the collapse of a takeover bid. The review was brought forward as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, which caused matches to be held behind closed doors, affecting revenue, and the failed attempt to launch a 12-team European Super League in April. The review's recommendations seek to address concerns over the financial disparity between the Premier League and the Championship, with clubs in the second tier breaching profitability and sustainability rules in attempts to gain promotion. This has been apparent this season with Reading deducted six points for breaking financial rules and Derby County docked a further nine points for breaches of EFL accounting rules, taking their overall deductions this season to 21 points. The European Super League, which involved six Premier League clubs, collapsed amid widespread condemnation from other clubs and players as well as governing bodies, politicians and especially fans. The review's 'golden share' proposal seeks to prevent this being attempted again as it gives fans a say over a club's heritage - including team colours and their stadium, as well as preventing them from playing in competitions not affiliated to Fifa, Uefa or the FA. The Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee chair Julian Knight MP said he welcomed the proposal of an independent football regulator. He said there must be ""urgent government action"" and called on Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries to introduce a football regulator in the next Queen's Speech. The Premier League said: ""We acknowledge the call for some form of independent regulation to protect English football's essential strengths and the Premier League has already undertaken our own governance and strategic reviews. ""These will continue to progress together with the ongoing work of the fan-led review. ""It is important to everyone that any reforms do not damage our game, its competitive balance or the levels of current investment."" EFL chairman Rick Parry said it is ""pleasing"" to see the review conclude that ""additional distributions"" from the top flight are required. He added: ""Achieving financial stability has to be the number one priority. ""Reducing volatility and fostering balance throughout the English leagues will provide the bedrock upon which reforms can be built."" Football Supporters' Association chief executive Kevin Miles said the review is ""potentially a huge step forward for football governance"" and that is ""now up to the government to deliver"". And the Manchester United Supporters Trust said the review included a ""big missed opportunity"" because of its ""failure to address the fundamental question of club ownership"". The Trust said it ""should have recommended measures to allow supporters who wish to invest in their club to do so""."

Alderney Electricity Ltd (AEL) said although the cost of fuel had increased, it would keep the price of a unit of electricity below the 50p per unit price cap for islanders. AEL raised the price of fuel and electricity in May 2022, but introduced an electricity fuel cost relief for customers for three months from 1 May.  Managing director James Lancaster said its latest shipment had ""risen significantly"". He said: “As anticipated, the cost of fuel received in the latest shipment has risen significantly as a result of recent world events and the volatility of the global fuels market. ""The fuel cost component is now 24.46p, which would have raised the price of a unit of electricity on the A tariff above the 50p price cap.  ""As AEL has brought in a subsidy of 4.35p per unit to be applied across all tariffs, this will bring electricity prices back in line with the cap."" Bills due from the end of May 2022 would receive subsidies, the company said. The price cap of 50p per unit for electricity was set in 2008"

Chris Thomas said while the terminal building was on track to be finished by late May or early June, the marine works would take longer.  They ""continued to present challenges due to the testing environment"", he said. The cost of the Manx government-funded project, which was originally due to be completed by 2020, has already increased from £38m to £70m. Mr Thomas was asked for an update on the facility at the Princes Half Tide Dock in the House of Keys this week. He refused to confirm a specific completion date, or a final cost of the project, which has almost doubled since the project began. However, he said about 70% of the scour protection work in the river, designed to limit damage to the quay walls caused by vessels, had been completed. Costs have spiralled in the last four years after the scheme was beset with delays. Mr Thomas said following initial setbacks due to the coronavirus pandemic, the project had more recently been hit by ""inflation and fuel cost volatility"".  That had not been anticipated when additional funding was sought in December 2021, he said. He said the Department of Infrastructure was ""working through these costs with the project team"" and it would ""not be appropriate to suggest the final figure at this stage"".  Jason Moorhouse MHK was concerned that there was 30% of the overall project still to complete within ""several months"", when 70% had taken ""several years"". Mr Thomas said: ""I remain optimistic that the current planned completion date of Autumn 2023 will be complied with."" That was ""despite all the challenges of the weather and the Mersey"", he added.

Volatility,US markets close higher after emergency virus deal,2024-09-25,2020-03-25,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-52030034,"US markets gained again as Donald Trump and the Senate agreed a massive economic relief package worth more than $1.8 trillion (£1.5tn). The package includes money to bail out industries that have been affected by the coronavirus crisis. Republican Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell described it as a ""wartime level of investment"" in the economy. The relief plans lifted financial markets around the world, but investors remained on edge. US markets, which surged on Tuesday in anticipation of the deal, teetered in the final moments of trade on Wednesday, closing below their peak for the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 2.4% higher, while the S&P 500 closed up 1.1%. The Nasdaq dipped 0.45%.  Shares in Boeing surged more than 23%, fuelled in part by expectations that it would benefit from the deal.  Earlier, shares rose in Europe and Asia on news of the relief package. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index closed 8% higher, while London's FTSE 100 index gained more than 4.4%. Full details of the deal agreed in the US will not be published until later on Wednesday. However, it is expected to contain measures to help people pay bills if they are laid off because of the virus, expand unemployment assistance by $250bn and get $350bn in emergency loans to small firms. Mr McConnell said it would also ""stabilise"" key industrial sectors and give money to hospitals and other healthcare providers which were having difficulty getting equipment. ""We're going to pass this legislation later today,"" Mr McConnell added. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer called the package ""the largest rescue package in American history"". He said it was a ""Marshall Plan"" for hospitals. ""Help is on the way, big help and quick help."" Separately, President Trump on Tuesday said he wanted to get the economy up and running again by Easter. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones jumped by 11.4% on Tuesday - its biggest one-day gain since the Great Depression - as political leaders signalled a deal was close. The final package is estimated to amount to about 10% of US output, more than double the relief offered during the 2008 financial crisis. William Foster, a vice president at Moody's Investors Service, said it would ""help mitigate the depth and duration of the economic shock"". ""Nonetheless, we expect the virus to have a significant negative impact on growth and the fiscal deficit this year,"" he said. Governments around the world have responded to a surge in coronavirus cases by locking down societies in the hope of slowing the spread of the virus.  The International Monetary Fund has warned the hit to global growth is likely to be bigger than the financial crisis. Many countries are now working on stimulus packages to support their economies, but these plans have received mixed responses from investors, as markets experience unprecedented volatility as they grapple with the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic. This month alone has seen the Dow having the five biggest daily gains and five biggest falls of its 135-year history. Reacting to news of the stimulus package, Tom Stevenson, investment director at fund manager Fidelity International, said: ""It's good news, but we're not out of the woods yet. ""When markets are falling, you get these big rallies but you shouldn't get stuck on that. They do bounce around in these situations."" The US rescue package follows five days of intense negotiations to try to agree a deal that will provide aid for American workers and businesses. Before it becomes law the deal must get through the Republican-controlled Senate, the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives and be signed by President Trump. The US central bank, the Federal Reserve has already announced $4tn in extra lending to help stimulate the economy in the face of the coronavirus. Nearly 19,000 people have died with coronavirus worldwide since it emerged in China's Wuhan province in January, and more than 420,000 infections have been confirmed. Southern Europe is now at the centre of the pandemic, with Italy and Spain recording hundreds of new deaths every day. The US has confirmed more than 55,000 cases, the third highest of any country after China and Italy. The US Congress has approved a $2tn rescue bill - the biggest package of support for the economy in modern American history. Like the UK's emergency economic measures, it offers $350bn in loans for small businesses to cover expenses for up to 10 weeks; it also offers $500bn in aid to airlines and other corporations. The government is also sending out cheques of $1,200 for every adult and $500 per child. But there's concern that the package, for all its huge size, simply isn't big enough to soften the scale of the economic shock caused by the Covid-19 shutdown, now a global phenomenon. Some economists say US firms may need five times as much cash to prevent mass bankruptcy and unemployment."
Volatility,Oil output to see small hike to ease energy prices,2024-09-25,2022-08-01,By Sameer Hashmi,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-62352272,"The world's biggest oil producers have agreed to raise production slightly in a bid help ease high prices. Members of oil producers' group Opec+ - which includes Russia - agreed on Wednesday to add 100,000 more barrels per day to the market from September. The latest production output increase is at a much slower pace than in recent months.  The decision is a blow to leaders who had called for production to be ramped up. They include US President Joe Biden, who travelled to Saudi Arabia in a bid to personally convince the country to pump more oil to help cool soaring prices. Crude has consistently traded at more than $100 a barrel since February, driving up the cost of living in many countries. Opec, which has 13 core members, was formed in 1960 as a cartel, with the aim of fixing the worldwide supply of oil and its price. Saudi Arabia is the biggest single producer in the cartel and after meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, President Biden said he expected supply to increase.  Saudi officials stressed any decision to increase supplies would be done in consultation with Opec+. For July and August, Opec+ had agreed to add more than 600,000 barrels a day to the market. But after the latest meeting, Opec+ decided it would raise oil output by just 100,000 barrels per day from September in what some analysts described as an insult. ""That is so little as to be meaningless. From a physical standpoint it is a marginal blip. As a political gesture it is almost insulting,"" said Raad Alkadiri, managing director for energy, climate, and sustainability at Eurasia Group. Opec+ is a wider group of 23 oil-exporting countries including Russia, which meets every month in Vienna to decide how much crude oil to sell on the world market.  Back in April 2020, Opec+ introduced a series of cuts that continued throughout the coronavirus pandemic as demand dropped. Since 2021 it has slowly been restoring this missing supply.  At the group's last gathering Opec+ decided to increase the number of barrels it produces a little during the month of August.  But just turning the taps on full may not be all that easy. At least on paper, several members of the cartel, like Angola, Nigeria and Malaysia are already struggling to meet their existing monthly supply targets.  Simultaneously, Russian supplies have also dropped due to western sanctions. Moscow, meanwhile, has ramped up its shipments to customers in Asia like China and India. Lynchpin, Saudi Arabia, and neighbour, the United Arab Emirates, are the only two major players with some spare capacity.  Saudi's production target for August, however, is 11 million barrels of oil per day, which energy experts suggest is already at a very high level, leaving little wiggle room for more increases. Perhaps weighing more heavily on the pair's decision though, may be uncertainty over energy demand in the coming months.  Rising interest rates, the war in Ukraine and looming recession in many western countries, could all seriously dent demand.  Experts think these factors are making the group cautious and unwilling to increase their output dramatically.  ""The concern for Saudi Arabia and Opec+ is that there are so many unknowns. No one knows where the oil markets will be six months from now, or next year,"" said Karen Young, senior fellow at Middle East Institute in Washington DC.  She added this means the Saudis and United Arab Emirates will want to use their spare supplies judiciously.  ""They don't want to be in a situation where they utilise their limited spare capacity to ramp-up production, and then suddenly, if demand shoots up or goes down in the future ...they are left with no room to make adjustments,"" she added. Before the invasion of Ukraine, Russia was the world's third largest producer of oil, behind the US and Saudi Arabia. It accounted for 8-10% of global oil supply.  Market analysts have suggested President Vladimir Putin wants to sustain high oil prices in order to keep paying for the Ukraine war and stave off the impact of crippling western economic sanctions.  For Saudi Arabia, unity among the Opec+ group is paramount, and it would avoid any decision that could jeopardise that. Opec itself is forecasting that global oil demand will rise in 2023 albeit at a slower pace than this year. Its analysts say this will be driven in part by progress in containing the coronavirus in China.  Estimates from the International Energy Agency and the US Energy Information Administration meanwhile suggest oil demand will continue rising strongly, despite growing fears over inflation in multiple countries and weakening economic growth. This means that oil producers may find themselves having to pump oil at the fastest pace in five years to balance out supply and demand - a tall order, given capacity constraints and the lack of investment in downstream and refining. ""There is a lot of volatility in the markets but not many people expect a sustained drop below $100 a barrel,"" said Ben Cahill, a senior fellow at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.  Gasoline prices in the United States have already touched a 13-year high this year.  The US has been releasing about one million barrels per day from its Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) since April - as part of its plan to add some 180 million barrels to the market over a six-month period finishing at the end of October.  However, Mr Cahill warned once this roll-out stops supplies will become even tighter, putting greater pressure on prices.   ""We still haven't seen any signs of major investments towards increasing production. So, if demand goes up, we won't have sufficient supplies to balance the markets"" he added. "
Volatility,Energy bills pushed higher by electricity charge,2024-09-25,2023-02-01,By Andy Verity & Tom Espiner,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-64471262,"The way electricity prices are set has pushed UK household bills up by £7.2bn over two years, analysis suggests. Under existing rules, energy suppliers pay the highest price for wholesale electricity no matter how it is made. Gas-fired power stations are the most expensive way to generate electricity, but only make about 40% of all electricity used by UK homes. That means homes pay over the odds for power generated any other way, said the Carbon Tracker Initiative. If an average price was used instead the UK's electricity bill could be much lower, the not-for-profit climate think tank said.  The Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (Beis) said it had ""already launched a major review"" of the electricity market ""to radically cut costs"" for consumers in the long term. The price for wholesale electricity is set by a bidding process, with each generating company saying what it would be willing to accept to produce a unit of power. When it's windy and sunny enough to meet demand for electricity through renewables, the wholesale cost drops to close to zero, according to Beis. But when it's not, the wholesale cost is set at the level that all providers will accept - which is the highest bid. In the past, gas powered generation was among the cheapest ways of producing electricity. For decades, wholesale gas was relatively cheap in the UK, and only started to soar in price in May 2021 as economies recovered from the pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine disrupted supplies. Wholesale gas prices have fallen sharply since August 2022, but are still about three times the price of May 2021. Charging an average price for wholesale electricity would have made the bill in the two years from 2021-22 £7.2bn lower, the Carbon Tracker Initiative said. According to BBC calculations that's about £250 per household. Due to the current system, firms that make renewable energy have been paid much more for their power than it costs them to generate.  For this reason the government introduced a temporary 45% tax in January on what it calls ""extraordinary returns"" from low-carbon electricity generators in the UK. Simon Francis, co-ordinator of the End Fuel Poverty Coalition, which campaigns for warm homes, said ""injustice"" in the electricity pricing system was at a ""shocking scale"" ""It cannot be right that consumers have been prevented from benefiting from the reduced cost of generating electricity,"" he said. Jonathan Sims, an energy analyst who wrote the CTI report, said the findings showed how the global gas market over the last two years had skewed British power prices. He said these prices did not reflect the different technology the UK now uses to generate electricity.  The CTI's report takes into account the need for sources of power that can be fired up immediately such as gas-fired, or provide near constant output such as nuclear, whereas wind power for example is weather-dependent.  The analysis also suggested Europe's most gas power-dependent countries, the UK and Italy, had consistently paid the highest prices for electricity during the recent period of gas price volatility.  The business department said it was consulting on changes that ""would stop volatile gas prices setting the price of electricity produced by much cheaper renewables"". It also said its windfall tax on renewables generators would ""help fund energy bill support for households and businesses""."
Volatility,UK gas prices fall from high after Russia steps in,2024-09-25,2021-10-06,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-58815665,"UK wholesale gas prices hit a record high before falling after Russia said it was boosting supplies to Europe. Russia President Vladimir Putin appeared to calm the market after gas prices had risen by 37% in 24 hours to trade at 400p per therm on Wednesday. UK gas was 60p per therm at the start of the year, but high global demand and reduced supply has driven prices up. The high cost of wholesale gas has seen several UK energy firms collapse and halted production across industries. Following Mr Putin's comments on supplies, gas prices dropped to about 257p a therm later on Wednesday. Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the changing gas prices underlined the ""volatility in the market and the nervousness amongst investors about low stockpiles of gas across Europe"". ""When Putin's promises help calm the storm of rising prices which was pummelling financial markets, it's clear investors are desperate for any gust of good news blowing in,"" she said. The surge in prices led to Energy Intensive Users Group, which represents steel, chemical and fertiliser firms, calling on the government to help keep businesses and industries running. Industry leaders said surging costs had already resulted in steel production halting ""at times of peak demand"". Last month, US-owned CF Industries shut two UK sites that produce 60% of the country's commercial carbon dioxide supplies because of the rise in gas prices, before the government stepped in to meet its operating costs for its Teesside plant for three weeks. The shut down led to a shortage of carbon dioxide - a by-product of the fertiliser factories - which sparked warnings from food producers and supermarkets of shortages in the supply of fresh produce. The gas is to stun animals for slaughter and in packaging to prolong shelf life. ""We have already seen the impact of the truly astronomical increases in energy costs on production in the fertiliser and steel sectors,"" said Richard Leese, chairman of the Energy Intensive Users Group. ""Nobody wants to see a repeat in other industries this winter, given that UK EIIs [energy intensive industries] produce so many essential domestic and industrial products and are intrinsically linked with many supply chains."" A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: ""We are determined to secure a competitive future for our energy intensive industries and in recent years have provided them with extensive support, including more than £2bn to help with the costs of energy and to protect jobs.  ""Our exposure to volatile global gas prices underscores the importance of our plan to build a strong, home-grown renewable energy sector to further reduce our reliance on fossil fuels."" Besides industry struggles, a total of nine energy suppliers have collapsed in recent weeks, which has affected nearly 1.73 million customers in September alone. The companies that have gone bust have been mostly smaller firms, which have been unable to deliver price promises to customers because of the surge in gas prices. Firms going bust has also had a knock on effect to auto-switching services, with Look After My Bills, famous for its popularity on BBC Two's Dragon's Den, ""pausing"" its operations, and fellow auto-switching company Flipper closing down completely. Flipper said in a statement that it had withdrawn from the market and was closing because it could ""no longer sustain the great savings"" its customers had ""come to expect"". Meanwhile, Look After My Bills said it was ""temporarily pausing"" its switching service, but would be ""back as soon as we can"" access energy deals ""right"" for customers. Affected customers have been told they will be switched to a new tariff by energy regulator Ofgem and be contacted by their new supplier. It has advised people to take a meter reading and to wait until a new supplier has been appointed before looking to switch to another energy firm. Jonathan Brearley, the boss of Ofgem, has warned that the cost of protecting customers from failing energy providers could lead to higher bills. A higher energy price cap came into force on Friday, with those on standard tariffs, with typical household levels of energy use, seeing bills go up by £139 to £1,277 a year. Customers are protected from sudden hikes in gas prices through the energy price cap, which sets maximum prices and charges for those on a standard or default tariff. However, the next revision of the cap, which will affect bills from the start of April, is likely to rise significantly to reflect the greater costs faced by suppliers. Analysts at energy consultancy Cornwall Insight have predicted the next cap will mean the typical household will have an annual bill of £1,600 and the impact of the crisis could be felt into 2023.  ""The explosion of choice and innovation seen in the sector in the last decade by challenger suppliers has been fundamentally altered in a matter of months, and while all eyes will inevitably be on this winter, the need for an enduring solution to ensure that the gains experienced by almost three decades of competition are not lost,"" said its senior consultant, Craig Lowrey."
Volatility,"Gold, rabbits and crypto: Venezuela's economic plans",2024-09-25,2018-10-02,By Daniel Gallas,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-45652921,"For years, Venezuela has been in the headlines for its economic woes, including chronic shortages of food and medicine. Inflation may hit the one million per cent mark this year and 2.3 million people have fled the country, becoming economic refugees. The government of Nicolas Maduro has responded with a raft of policies - some of them very unorthodox - to try to deal with what is arguably the worst economic crisis of the decade. From a digital currency backed by oil, to urban farming projects that include breeding rabbits and chickens at home, the government in Caracas has not been lacking in creativity. But have these ideas helped Venezuelans? This year more than $20bn (£15bn) has been raised through cryptocurrency Initial Coin Offerings (ICO), according to UK-based portal Coinschedule. The point of an ICO is to raise funds to create a new digital asset, such as a cryptocurrency. Some of them are attractive because the high volatility in their exchange rates can produce great returns. To the issuer, an ICO is a great way to raise funds. In February, Venezuela's government said it raised $735m with the launch of the ""petro"" - claiming it was the world's first virtual currency issued by a sovereign nation.  If that number is true, the petro's ICO would have been the fourth largest in the world in 2018. But it is hard to verify the government's claims. In the cryptocurrency world, very few trust any official information released about the petro so far. ""Reaction from the cryptocurrency community has been a mixture of dumbfoundedness and anger,"" says Alex Tapscott from the Blockchain Research Institute. Information about how much oil Venezuela produces is sketchy.  ""The government says each unit of the petro is backed by oil,"" says Mr Tapscott. ""But we have no proof at all. There is very little technical information about it."" Recently, Mr Maduro announced that Venezuela's revamped currency would be pegged to the petro, and that the cryptocurrency would be soon introduced in international trade. The BBC asked Venezuela's Superintendence of Cryptoassets for more information, but received no reply. Mr Tapscott says the government's attempt to launch its own cryptocurrency is eclipsing a more significant change in Venezuela's economy: the rise of Bitcoin, the world's most popular cryptocurrency. According to statistics website Coin Dance, the weekly trade of bitcoins in bolivars grew 58-fold since the beginning of this year, as people searched for new ways to store value amidst growing inflation. Oil is not the only abundant resource in Venezuela. The country claims to have the world's fourth largest gold mine, although currently Venezuela is not even in the top ten list of gold producing nations. Earlier this month, the government launched its Savings in Gold programme, allowing Venezuelans to buy certificates that entitle them to 1.5g or 2.5g gold bars. As with the petro, economists say the whole system depends on the government's credibility. It is Venezuela's government, not international markets, that stipulates the price of gold in sovereign bolivars. So Venezuelans who take part in the programme are buying their government's word. Tareck El Aissami, Venezuela's minister of industry, says 12 million bolivares soberanos (about $200,000 according to one exchange rate) has been raised to help the government ""reach fiscal balance and protect social investment"". No-one from the government would talk to the BBC about this move. In March, Nicolas Maduro published a video on Twitter, in which he is seen feeding 152 chickens and collecting their eggs. ""We can all produce (food). This is urban agriculture,"" he said. ""If (First Lady) Cilia and I can do it, why can't everyone else?"" Last year, the government announced a pilot programme to distribute rabbits to the population, extolling the virtues of its meat. But the plan became a joke even within Mr Maduro's cabinet. Agriculture minister Freddy Bernal said people had become emotionally attached to the rabbits and were keeping them as pets. ""We need a publicity campaign on radio, TV, in newspapers, in cartoons, everywhere, so that the people understand that rabbits aren't pets but two and a half kilos of meat,"" Mr Bernal said at the time. A more orthodox approach against the crisis was announced in August 2018.  The government renamed the national currency, dropped five zeros from it, raised the minimum wage to 34 times its previous level, and promised to curb fuel subsidies.  But analysts say these measures are merely ""a small blow against the wind, when there is a tsunami"". ""All these measures are completely irrelevant, there is no economic plan in Venezuela,"" says Siobhan Morden, a Latin America expert at financial services firm Nomura. ""The damage [already done to the economy] is so extensive that any measures, even if orthodox, are only piecemeal."" Ms Morden says the petro cryptocurrency and the Savings in Gold programme are a distraction.  Financial services group Nomura's assessment of Venezuela is a dire one. It says oil production is declining by 50,000 barrels per day - and the country is dropping its output by almost a third every year. The fiscal deficit is about 20% of GDP and there is very little economic data coming out of Venezuela that can be trusted or fact-checked. The prolonged crisis has also wiped out much of Venezuela's industrial sector. To begin to tackle Venezuela's crisis, Ms Morden says the government would have to completely overhaul the economy, by dismantling price and exchange controls and stabilising the oil sector. For now, nothing resembling those measures seems to be on Mr Maduro's agenda. "
Volatility,How a small Hong Kong firm saw its shares soar,2024-09-25,2022-08-04,By Peter Hoskins,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-62417010,"A little-known Hong Kong company has seen its stock market value soar in recent days, for no apparent reason. AMTD Digital made its New York debut last month, priced at $7.80 a share. This week, the firm's shares have been on a rollercoaster ride, closing on Wednesday at $1,100. The meteoric rise in AMTD Digital's value has seen it likened by some commentators to ""meme stocks"", shares that gain popularity among retail investors through social media. Trading in the company's shares has been particularly volatile this week, as its value rose above $300bn on Tuesday. That meant that AMTD Digital briefly overtook technology giant Alibaba's New York stock market valuation. In Wednesday's trade it plunged by more than 30%, but that still gave it a higher US market value than Disney. On Monday, AMTD Digital thanked investors and said it ""noted significant volatility"" in trading. ""The company is also monitoring the market closely for any unusual trading activities or abnormalities,"" the statement said. AMTD Digital offers services to develop online businesses' financial services technology. It had 50 members of staff as of the end of February this year, according to a stock market filing. It makes money mainly by charging fees and commissions for its digital financial services business, which brought in just over $25m in revenue last year, according to a regulatory filing. A space-themed corporate video on the company's website highlights the range of digital services that the company offers. The company's website describes it ""as the fusion reactor at the core of the AMTD SpiderNet ecosystem, AMTD Digital is a one-stop digital solutions platforms in Asia with businesses spanning multiple verticals, including digital financial services, digital media, content & marketing, SpiderNet ecosystem solutions, and digital investments."" Some commentators have likened the rise in AMTD Digital's value to so-called ""meme stocks"". Due to the nature of their popularity, trading in meme stocks is often extremely speculative and volatile. US retailer GamesStop and cinema chain AMC were two of the most high profile meme stocks that saw their shares soar last year. ""This is a major head-scratcher and it shows that the era of meme stocks is not over with a $300bn market cap,"" Dan Ives, managing director of Wedbush Securities told the BBC. ""In a major risk off market in 2022 it's bewildering this meme dynamic can still happen but yet it has and Wall Street is watching this latest craze,"" he added. AMTD Digital did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the BBC."
Volatility,Is the honeymoon period over for Brazil's Bolsonaro?,2024-09-25,2019-04-10,By Katy Watson,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-47865386,"Jair Bolsonaro won Brazil's presidential election last October on a platform of change.  He said he would deliver a safer Brazil to appease those worried about rising violence, an economic turnaround after several years of crisis and - perhaps most central to his campaign - an end to old-style corrupt politics which have seen dozens of high-ranking politicians, including a former president, jailed.  For millions of Brazilians fed up with the status quo, the gun-loving former army officer was the only man for the top job despite sexist, racist and a homophobic remarks he made during the campaign. While 100 days in office may not be long enough to judge the president's performance, some of his erstwhile supporters are now expressing doubts about his ability to lead the largest democracy in Latin America.  And among his detractors, there is definitely a feeling of ""I told you so"" after his first months were beset by a series of problems.  Late last month, the president caused outrage by suggesting the armed forces commemorate the start of military rule 55 years ago. His anti-corruption image has been tainted by allegations that his son Flavio was involved in financial scandals and death squads.  And then of course, there was that awkward time during carnival when he posted a video on Twitter of a sex act performed by two men at a street party that he felt was bringing the reputation of the country down.  He has now got the lowest approval rating recorded by a first-time president in the initial 100 days in power since the country returned to democracy in the 1980s. ""The feeling is that the situation is worse than it was before the elections,"" says Rafael Alcadipani, an associate professor at the Getulio Vargas Foundation. ""Everyone wanted change in society but the commander-in-chief hasn't shown himself to be capable of delivering any type of change.""  ""He's failed to show Brazilians confidence in his plan for government,"" says Roberta Braga, associate director at the Atlantic Council's Adrienne Arsht Latin America Centre in Washington DC. ""He's losing a lot of support. It clearly takes time to implement these very complex reforms but Brazilians expected a lot from him.""  One of Mr Bolsonaro's campaign commitments was to bring down violence by making it easier for people to own guns. Within a couple of weeks of being sworn in, he had loosened regulations to make it easier to keep guns at home.  This was music to the ears of people like gun club member Natasha Imata, whom I met at LAAD Expo, Latin America's largest security and defence show in Rio de Janeiro last week.  But despite his swift action on gun ownership, Ms Imata thinks that the new president is ""not focussed on security"".  Her husband Vitor agrees. ""His whole campaign was focussed on helping Brazilians but that's not happened. It's been a weak start,"" he says. Brazil's stock market and currency soared after Mr Bolsonaro's election in what some dubbed the ""Bullsonaro wave"". But since he took over power on 1 January, signals have been more mixed.  While many in the industry point to a strong economic team led by market-friendly economy minister Paulo Guedes, unemployment levels have remained stubbornly high.  There is also a reluctant acceptance that the government may not be able to push through much-needed reforms such as pension cuts as easily as it had hoped. ""We have serious doubts about the capacity of the government to continue to do these reforms,"" says Andre Perfeito, chief economist at Necton brokerage in São Paulo. ""Bolsonaro's main promise was pension reform. And he's not doing the political job to deliver that."" Others though, are more upbeat.  Walter Maciel is the CEO of independent asset management company AZ Quest: ""Most of the old political leaders were not re-elected and went home. There is a major renovation in congress, a new government that was elected by people who desired a huge change, not only in the way the country was led but also in the way that politics was done.""  ""So you have a lot of new people coming in, many of them coming in without any political experience. Of course there's some kind of externality and undesired volatility but it's part of the learning process,"" Mr Maciel says.   Government worker Gabriel Moraes voted for Jair Bolsonaro but says he would not do so again. He thinks the president needs to be more statesman-like and has so far failed.  ""As a head of state, any message he sends out is a reflection of society today,"" Mr Moraes argues. ""Life in civil society isn't like an army barracks. Sure there has to be order and discipline but there have to be principles, rules and respect too."" But his cousin Alessandra Guadelupe Regondi disagrees. A big fan of President Bolsonaro, she says he represents something very different, something that Brazil needs. With a military background in her family, Ms Regondi warmed to the politician during the campaign.  His promises of cutting ministries in the government and making it more efficient, for example, appealed to her and she has even got a photo of the two of them together, in pride of place on her bookshelf in the living room.  Ms Regondi does not see any problem with the president's social media habit. ""It helps him get closer to the people,"" she argues.  ""Leaders were always from the same parties,"" she says. ""He's a new hope, like Donald Trump was. He went against everything - and still won."" "
Volatility,Hard frost on Scotland's economy,2024-09-25,2018-01-17,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-42720355,"The latest figures for output from the economy show double the rate of growth in the second quarter of last year. But as that was 0.1%, it couldn't have been lower without stalling. The rise in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was half the rate of growth of the whole UK, which at 0.4% is not good either.  Scottish growth has recently been little more than a third as strong - 0.6% growth over the year to September, compared with 1.7% for the UK. Economic output per head hasn't improved for two-and-a-half years, and it's barely risen from the level it was at 12 years ago. The latest figures look worse when set against the Scottish government's other target for growth - to match the small country average across the European Union. The most recent figures put it three percentage points lower than those countries. So that looks less of a target than a distant dream, for now.  The price of Brexit is a possible explanation for the performance being so much smaller than Sweden to Slovenia, but it doesn't explain why Scotland has been growing more slowly than the whole UK. So from these figures, there's not much sign of green shoots in the Scottish economy. It looks more like a continued hard frost. That's despite the help to exports of sterling's weakness.  And more recent evidence, from 500 companies surveyed in December for the monthly Purchasing Managers Index, showed their output levels were getting even worse than last summer, and have been contracting. You have to go back three years to see robust figures.  Since the start of 2015, there have been only two quarters when growth has been above the anaemic 0.2% mark. Two quarters saw no growth, and two registered a contraction. So what has happened, according to this data? The construction sector has slowed up. Big infrastructure projects have been winding down and completed, so you could say it is back at more normal levels. From the peak at the end of 2015, construction output is down nearly 15%. Though it's impact is unclear for now, the collapse of Carillion construction giant certainly won't help, particularly amid the supply chain and sub-contractors. The energy sector has proven volatile. The figures don't include offshore oil and gas production, but they do include the sector that services the offshore producers. That category has fallen with the oil price and the end of some big investment projects - down 17% since the start of 2015. There are a number of signs that the oil sector decline has bottomed out in the past year, and output is now more steady, so it ought to become less of a drag on the rest of the economy. A rising source of volatility is renewable energy.  A good quarter of wind, and output rises sharply. Between July and September, production was up 8%.   Over a longer period, these figures suggest the output from wind turbines has replaced the economic contribution from Cockenzie and Longannet coal-burning power stations, which closed in recent years - at least by this measure. And when the wind drops? Not so much. For most Scots, including most in the public sector, work is in the services category, representing three-quarters of the economy.  That has been growing slowly and steadily, though there are signs of the very large business services and finance category stalling over the past year. It represents more than quarter of the whole economy. Manufacturing is easily seen as a symbol of output, though it represents only 11% of the economy.  By this measure, less is made in Scotland than in 1998. It is having a better run, helped by exports into a strengthening global economy. But compared with the UK, again it doesn't look good.  Since the start of 2015, Scottish manufacturing is down nearly 6%, while UK output is up 3%. The reason for this growth pattern remains a puzzle for economists. The oil and gas slowdown does not explain it all. But all are agreed that stagnant productivity is key to getting things moving again. When measured by output per head, as the population grows, Scotland saw no growth at all in the third quarter of last year, and the UK saw growth of only 0.1%. Indeed, Scottish growth per head hasn't grown at all for 10 quarters. That's right: two-and-a-half years, with growing employment, and no more total output per head. Compared with the pre-crash year, 2006, output per head is only 1.4% higher. So it makes sense - though it seems late to start this - that three of the country's think tanks - the David Hume Institute, the new Scottish Policy Foundation and the Fraser of Allander Institute - are joining forces to find out more about what's happening with productivity, and what can be done about it.

Volatility,University pensions deficit could be £23bn,2024-09-25,2019-08-01,By Dominic O'Connell,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-49194091,"The pension scheme for university academics would face a deficit of £23bn if it had to be rescued by a government-backed pension lifeboat, the scheme's annual accounts show. The figures will stoke a fierce debate about the Universities Superannuation Scheme's (USS) financial position. It has assets of more than £60bn and provides retirement incomes and savings for about 200,000 UK university staff.  The USS said it funds the scheme in a ""fair and balanced way"". In February and March 2018, academics at 64 universities took industrial action over plans by their employer Universities UK to reduce future benefits and introduce a less-generous pension arrangement. The University and College Union said the new plans would leave them up to £10,000 a year worse off in retirement, and younger staff would be worst affected, with some losing up to half their pensions. USS's accounts for the year to the end of March 2019, which were published last week, give several different figures for the size of the scheme deficit. The ""best estimate"" for the scheme is a surplus of £5.2bn, which the accounts say ""does not build in prudence and has a 50% chance of being more than is required to pay the benefits, and 50% of being too little"". The technical provisions estimate, which includes ""prudence"", is £7.5bn. The buyout deficit - arrived at by assuming that universities paid an insurance company like the Prudential to take the scheme off their hands and pay out all future benefits - is £63.9bn. The accounts contain another estimate, which follows the standard rules laid down by the Pension Protection Fund (PPF), which is the backstop scheme for retirement plans that get into financial difficulty.  In recent years, the PPF has taken on the schemes of companies such as MG Rover, BHS, Carillion and Hoover. If the PPF took over the university scheme - which would see some academics receiving reduced payouts in retirement - the deficit would be £23.1bn.  The USS disagrees, however. A spokesman said: ""Our focus is on funding the scheme in a balanced and responsible way that ensures members' pensions are secure.  ""There has been intensive engagement to ensure the institutions in the scheme understand clearly, and are collectively able and willing to support, the levels of risk and volatility in the scheme. ""The PPF measure does not take into account the specifics of the scheme or the benefits of investing in a diverse range of assets."" John Ralfe, the independent pensions expert, said: ""The hard PPF numbers show how huge USS's deficit is, and how it has ballooned."" Whistleblowing In May, statistician Prof Jan Hutton, a USS trustee, told the Financial Times that she had been thwarted in her efforts to investigate whether the pensions deficit had been exaggerated to justify the cuts.  She claimed to have identified a calculation error in the ""retirement rate"" used to calculate the deficit in November 2017, and she took her concerns to the pensions regulator in March 2018. USS had claimed to have a £7.5bn deficit in November 2017, which prompted Universities UK to put forward proposals to reduce future benefits and introduce a less-generous pension arrangement. Universities dropped plans to move from a defined-benefit scheme, which gives a guaranteed retirement income, to a defined-contribution scheme, where their pensions would be subject to the performance of the stock market. However, defined benefit scheme members and universities have been asked to raise their contributions in order to fix the deficit. Unhappy with this, Prof Hutton went public, and as a result of the press coverage, in June more than 1,000 academics signed an open letter calling for an urgent inquiry into the governance of the USS fund.  New ballots are planned for September. Universities have said union demands for extra contributions to the scheme could bankrupt some institutions, and severely curtail academic activity at others.

Volatility,Covid sees share of women on India's stock market rise,2024-09-25,2020-11-28,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-54873285,"More and more Indian women have turned to the stock market during the pandemic to bolster their savings, reports the BBC's Nidhi Rai in Mumbai.  Sakina Gandhi has found a new passion: stock market trading.  The 31-year-old works in public relations and until this year had only invested in mutual funds, generally seen as a safer bet than directly trading in stocks.  But when India went into a stringent lockdown in March to prevent the spread of Covid-19, Ms Gandhi found herself with a lot of time on her hands.  ""I had time to look at the market,"" she says. ""The first 15 days I only tracked the market. I made a list of stocks and analysed what kind of volatility they were showing. After consulting a few colleagues, I bought those stocks."" It proved to be a lucrative option.  Share prices plunged amid fears over the virus and stayed low as the lockdown battered the Indian economy. But they soon picked up as investor sentiment rallied. Trusted stocks braved the storm and some company valuations have since grown substantially. Prices remain at a high, buoyed by falling Covid case numbers and the promise of a vaccine.  This is despite heavy job losses, negative growth and other macro factors that have left the Indian economy reeling.  But that's also why working women such as Ms Gandhi are looking to make some extra money. And she is not alone.  ""There is a definite rise in new women investors,"" says Nikhil Kamath, co-founder of Zerodha, a stockbroking company.  Of the more than 1.5 million clients the firm has added since the outbreak of Covid-19 in India earlier this year, some 235,000 are women. That's about half of their women investors, whose average age is 33 years, Mr Kamath says.  Another stockbroking firm, FYERS Securities, told the BBC it has seen a three-fold rise in active women traders.  This fits with the larger trend in India that appears to have been wrought by the pandemic - a surge in demat accounts, an electronic facility for passing virtual share certificates between investors. Some 6.3 million new demat accounts were opened in India between April and September this year, according to market regulator SEBI (Securities and Exchange Board of India). This is more than double of last year's tally for the same period (2.7 million).  And many of these investors are young women, says stockbroking firms.  Ritika Shah, 36, comes from a family that has long invested in the stock market but she had never done so - until this year. ""I was waiting for the right time to do it. The pandemic gave me time to plan my finances. I got time to research, study and follow up,"" she said.  Mr Khoday says women are typically more ""inclined to invest than trade"". That is, they buy traditional assets such as gold or park money in safe place such as fixed deposits and, more recently, tax-saving mutual funds.  The lockdown also turned out to be a good time to enter the market. Ms Shah, for instance, says the valuation for the market in March was a deciding factor.  Mr Kamat says fixed deposits, although safe, became less attractive and mutual funds dropped too, encouraging people to start investing directly in stocks. So, he adds, people's attention turned to capital markets because of the ""heavily discounted valuations of fundamentally strong large-capital companies"".  The surge has also been aided by technology and simplified processes.  Cheap data allowed investors to stay hooked to the stock market; and online banking and trading quickened buying and selling. Many broking firms are charging almost no fees, enticing new investors. Firms have also begun educating investors about the stock market and have seen an uptick in visits to their website.  The biggest encouragement came from market regulator SEBI, which eased the process of opening a demat account. It also allowed the e-signatures and digital lockers so paperwork can be processed fast and from within the confines of home during the pandemic.  And those who decided to give it a shot have even begun to enjoy it. Ms Gandhi says she tracks stocks in the newspaper daily and has also set up Google alerts for news of companies that interest her.  ""It's my money"" she says. ""My husband or anyone has no say in it. Therefore I thought why not take some risk and see what happens. It actually turned out to be good."" "
Volatility,India watchdog probing Adani fraud allegations,2024-09-25,2023-02-14,By Annabelle Liang & Nikhil Inamdar,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-64633419,"India's markets regulator has confirmed that it is investigating allegations made by Hindenburg Research against companies owned by multi-billionaire Gautam Adani. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) also says it is examining market activity around the report. Mr Adani's business empire had over $100bn (£82.3bn) wiped off its stock market value after the claims of market manipulation and financial fraud. Adani Group has denied the claims. On Monday, SEBI said in a Supreme Court filing that it was studying the allegations and ""the market activity immediately preceding and post the publication of the report"". ""SEBI is strongly and adequately empowered to put in place regulatory frameworks for effecting stable operations and development of the securities markets,"" it added in a filing to the Supreme Court. Adani Group did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment. But the group did tell the Reuters news agency that it had strong cashflows and its business plans were fully funded. ""We are confident in the continued ability of our portfolio to deliver superior returns to shareholders,"" it said. Meanwhile, the conglomerate's flagship company, Adani Enterprises, reported a net profit of nearly $100m for the October to December quarter, against a loss of $1.5m in the same period a year earlier. Its total revenue jumped by 42% to $3.3bn, owing to a strong performance in its airports, coal trading and new energy businesses.  ""Our fundamental strength lies in mega-scale infrastructure project execution capabilities… the current market volatility is temporary,"" said Mr Adani in the results statement. The company did not announce any cutback in growth projections or investment plans, or comment on the decision by France's TotalEnergies to put its partnership with Adani for a green hydrogen project on hold following the Hindenburg report. Shares in Adani Enterprises were up 5% on Mumbai's stock exchange after plunging nearly 50% over the past month.  Mr Adani's group has seven publicly-traded companies which operate across a wide range of sectors, including commodities trading, airports, utilities, ports and renewable energy.  Last month, a report by US-based short-seller Hindenburg Research alleged that Adani Group companies had engaged in decades of ""brazen"" stock manipulation and accounting fraud. It also claimed its companies had ""substantial debt"" which put the entire group on a ""precarious financial footing"". Short-selling is betting that the value of an asset will fall. Adani Group has categorically denied the allegations. It has said previously that the Hindenburg report was intended to enable the US-based short seller to book gains, without citing evidence."
Volatility,Manx government could take control of gas firms,2024-09-25,2022-10-26,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-isle-of-man-63400991,"Laws giving the Manx government the power to take control of struggling gas companies in an emergency have been progressed by the House of Keys.  The Department of Environment, Food and Agriculture's (DEFA) Energy Bill 2022 passed its second reading on Tuesday. DEFA Minister Clare Barber said the legislation ""strengthens government's power to intervene"" and ensure the island's gas supply is maintained. The consequence of losing supply was ""too dire to contemplate"", she added. The proposed laws would pave the way for powers allowing the Council of Ministers to temporarily take over a gas firm that had fallen into financial difficulty so that public energy supplies were not affected. Under that scenario, the government would be required to pay the firm ""reasonable compensation"" for the intervention, which was intended to be used as a last resort and only with the approval of Tynwald. The move mirrors laws in the UK, which allows the government there to put firms under similar pressure into administration.  Private firm Isle of Man Energy, formerly know as Manx Gas, is currently the island's monopoly gas provider. Ms Barber said energy suppliers had been facing ""major economic pressure"" in recent times, and it was important to have the laws in place to avoid the ""catastrophic outcomes"" a loss of supply would cause.  David Ashford MHK said he was concerned a lack of clarity over what was ""reasonable compensation"" could leave the government open to a ""messy court case"". In response, Ms Barber said the fee paid would have to be determined within ""the particular circumstances"" of the emergency. Recent volatility in the wholesale gas market has seen customers on the island face hikes bills this year, but tariffs are currently under review again by the island's regulator.

Volatility,On the border beat in County Armagh,2024-09-25,2018-11-17,By Chris Page,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-46235640,"On the border beat in in County Armagh - policing is not like anywhere else in the UK. When I accompanied Sgt Sam Hoey on a drive around his area - we were in a convoy of four armoured cars. ""We're not just worried about the threat for dissident republicans,"" the experienced officer explains. ""We're also worried about being rammed by other vehicles, and being run over or blocked in places."" On the narrow, single-track roads - where it is difficult for non-locals to know where the border actually is - it is easy to see how police would be vulnerable to anyone who would want to trap them.  As well as dealing with crime which can happen anywhere - such as burglary, domestic violence and drink-driving - the presence of the border means there is a specific threat from organised crime gangs, who are involved in smuggling on either side of the border to  Sgt Hoey's radio crackles with a call-sign, and a colleague informs him of an incident in Flurrybridge, very close to the UK's only land frontier.  ""Two boys made off in a van across the border. Windscreen smashed. They've got two boys detained with drugs."" Sgt Hoey points out that is a prime example of co-operation between the Police Service of Northern Ireland and its counterparts in the Irish Republic, An Garda Siochana. PSNI officers and the Garda are in touch on a cross-border radio, and alert each other when a vehicle they are pursuing crosses from one country into another. ""The reason why we can't cross the border is because we're carrying firearms,"" Sgt Hoey tells me. ""So if we crossed into the south, we'd be liable for arrest."" Police officers on both sides have numbered codenames for each border crossing point - or ""BCPs"", as they call them. ""So we'll get a call saying there's a vehicle coming across at BCP 32, for example,"" says Sgt Hoey. There are 55 road BCPs in his district alone - and about 270 in total.  Sgt Hoey joined the police as a part-time reservist in 1989, and moved into the regular force a few years later. He has spent most of his career working near the border - and often reflects on the remarkable change which has taken place.  He points out a hill just outside Newry where there used to be a military watchtower. He and colleagues would have been flown to and from it by helicopter, or walked to it if there was bad weather.  At the beginning of his time in the police, he did not patrol by car at all.  ""The threat was just so high of land mines,"" he says. ""Two police officers would be walking about with 10 or 12 soldiers."" Over the course of the peace process, the police have spent years building up relationships with communities which had been historically hostile.   In South Armagh, there are still some villages where they ""don't get many calls"", according to Sgt Hoey - but he can see that gradually changing. Likewise, the number of signs on lamp posts with messages like ""No RUC here"" are dwindling.  But signs expressing opinions about Brexit are common sights on our journey. The messages include ""No Hard Border Here,"" and ""Stand Against Brexit."" The PSNI Chief Constable, George Hamilton, and his team of senior officers are examining what the UK's departure from the EU might mean for them. As well as the impact of any potential changes to the border arrangements - he identifies a general increased focus on identity issues, among both unionists and nationalists, as something which may lead to increased challenges for police.  Mr Hamilton told me: ""We just know what it is like policing the volatility of Northern Ireland, and these issues of identity and uncertainty often lead to an increase in tension."" He is employing 102 extra officers between now and the end of this financial year, which is close to the date when the UK is leaving the EU.  But there's likely to be a bid to the government to fund more more - though exactly how many depends on the shape of Brexit. While he warns that even a Brexit deal would not resolve all the issues for police - because ""the terms of that deal may not meet with agreement from everyone"" - he also suggests that he'd expect to need more policing resources to deal with the consequences if there was not a deal.  Back on the border beat, Sgt Hoey hopes what he describes as the ""massive progress"" of the last few years continues.  I'm not a politician, I'm a police officer,"" he says.  ""But small decisions that are made for us can have massive implications for me working along the border."""
Volatility,"Mine e-waste, not the Earth, say scientists",2024-09-25,2022-05-07,By Victoria Gill,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-61350996,"The recycling of e-waste must urgently be ramped up because mining the Earth for precious metals to make new gadgets is unsustainable, scientists say. One study estimated that the world's mountain of discarded electronics, in 2021 alone, weighed 57 million tonnes.  The Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC) says there now needs to be a global effort to mine that waste, rather than mining the Earth.  Global conflicts also pose a threat to supply chains for precious metals.  The RSC is running a campaign to draw attention to the unsustainability of continuing to mine all the precious elements used in consumer technology. It points out that geopolitical unrest, including the war in Ukraine, has caused huge spikes in the price of materials like nickel, a key element in electric vehicle batteries.  This volatility in the market for elements is causing ""chaos in supply chains"" that enable the production of electronics. Combined with the surge in demand, this caused the price of lithium - another important component in battery technology - to increase by almost 500% between 2021 and 2022.  Current reserves of some key elements, researchers say, are simply running out.  ""Our tech consumption habits remain highly unsustainable and have left us at risk of exhausting the raw elements we need,"" said Prof Tom Welton, president of the Royal Society of Chemistry, adding that those habits were ""continuing to exacerbate environmental damage"". All the while, the amount of e-waste generated is growing by about two million tonnes every year. Less than 20% is collected and recycled. ""We need governments to overhaul recycling infrastructure and tech businesses to invest in more sustainable manufacturing,"" said Prof Welton.  New research by the RSC also revealed a growing demand from consumers for more sustainable technology. In an online survey of 10,000 people across 10 countries, 60% said they would be more likely to switch to a rival of their preferred tech brand if they knew the product was made in a sustainable way. The survey also suggested that people did not know how to deal with their own e-waste. Many respondents said they worried about the environmental effect of unused devices they have in their homes, but did not know what to do with them or were concerned about the security of recycling schemes. Elizabeth Ratcliffe from the Royal Society of Chemistry, told BBC Radio 4's inside Science that many of us were ""unwittingly stockpiling precious metals in our homes"", in old phones and defunct computers.  ""Manufacturers and retailers need to take more responsibility,"" said Ms Ratcliffe. ""Like 'take-back' schemes, meaning people can return their electronics to a retailer and be assured they will be recycled securely. ""All this volatility in supply chains really just reinforces the fact that we need a circular economy for these materials. At the moment, we're just mining them out of the ground constantly.""  The society hopes to encourage people to take old and unwanted devices to recycling centres, rather than stuff them into drawers and forget about them. It points UK consumers to online resources where they can find the nearest centre that pledges to recycle computers, phones and other devices securely.  ""The thing we always say is reduce, reuse and recycle. So perhaps keep a phone for longer and maybe sell an old phone or give it to a relative,"" says Ms Ratcliffe. ""It will need everyone working together to scale up these processes and put the infrastructure in place, so we can all recycle our devices.""  Follow Victoria on Twitter"
Volatility,US jobs and wages rise in January,2024-09-25,2018-02-02,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42921615,"The US labour market barrelled forward in January, as employers added more jobs than expected and wage growth was its strongest in more than eight years. US payrolls expanded by 200,000 last month, driven by hiring in construction, food services and health care, the US Labor Department said. The average hourly wage for private sector workers crept up 2.9% compared to January 2017. The unemployment rate held steady at 4.1%. Economists have puzzled over lacklustre wage growth, which has lagged in prior months despite the decline in the unemployment rate. Without higher wages, economists have warned that economic growth will be difficult to sustain, since consumer spending plays a large role in the US economy. The Labor Department report, released on Friday, showed average hourly earnings for private sector workers rose 9 cents in January, to $26.74. For the year, the increase was 75 cents. The wage uptick coincided with mandatory minimum pay increases in 18 states. Major employers such as Walmart have also said they planned to boost earnings or provide bonuses. Those factors may have helped lift last month's numbers, but they make it harder to say if the increases will continue, said Lindsey Piezga, chief economist for fixed income at Stifel, based in Chicago. ""While that is encouraging, what we really need to see is sustained wage growth, not one-off, month-to-month volatility,"" she said. Other data in the report was a reminder that monthly gains can be fleeting. For example, the unemployment rate among black workers jumped in January to 7.7%, rising after falling to a record low of 6.8% in December. President Donald Trump had trumpeted that decline as evidence of economic improvement. The US is now in its ninth year of expansion and has been adding jobs steadily since 2010. The increases in January occurred across most industries, a sign of solid growth. The pace of hiring is slowing, however. Over the last three months, payrolls increased by an average of 192,000 jobs, compared to over 200,000 in the same period the prior year. ""I don't think we should be too excited about this,"" said Ms Piezga. ""The momentum of the US economy is waning. We're still talking about positive growth, positive job creation, but at a slower pace."" Economists have said some slowdown in job creation is to be expected as new workers become harder to find.  Despite a relatively high number of job openings, participation in the labour force has remained stuck below 63%, several percentage points lower than it was before the financial crisis. US stock indexes slid after the report.  Analysts said part of the decline was due to investor reaction to the wage increase, which is likely to keep the Federal Reserve on track to raise interest rates - and could make policymakers move more aggressively. The Fed is one of several central banks that are turning from policies that were designed to boost economic activity in the aftermath of the financial crisis."
Volatility,Concert venue revamp costs soar again to £132m,2024-09-25,2023-01-17,By Adam Postans,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-bristol-64302085,"The cost of a concert venue revamp has risen by another £25m, almost three times the original estimate.  The refurbishment of the Bristol Beacon was initially expected to cost £48m but that figure is now likely to reach £132m.  The council's cabinet is set to approve the increased bill from additional borrowing to be paid back over the next 50 years. It follows a doubling of costs for the project less than two years ago. A report to the council states that the building sits on a constrained site and has suffered from a lack of maintenance and modernisation with no major refurbishment for 60 years. The council-owned building, formerly known as the Colston Hall, is already valued at zero in the authority's accounts. Bristol City Council has also written off £69m on the project - a figure expected to rise to £93m - because of payments due to contractor Willmott Dixon. But papers for next week's cabinet meeting reveal that the alternatives to continuing the refurbishment would be even more expensive and cause the reopening to be delayed by years ""due to unprecedented volatility and uncertainty in the construction sector"". Of the three options considered ploughing on with the scheme - with the aim of welcoming audiences again this autumn - will cost £131.9m. Pausing the revamp and restarting in 12 months would increase that to £165m, while stopping the work altogether and making the building safe would need more than £200m. So officers are recommending that cabinet takes the ""least risk, least cost option"" and completes the project. Follow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Volatility,US inflation accelerates in January,2024-09-25,2018-02-14,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-43057242,"US consumer prices rose faster than expected in January, a sign of firming inflation that bolstered expectations of higher interest rates. The Consumer Price Index grew by 0.5% against forecasts of a 0.3% rise. The report followed earlier data showing accelerating US wage growth. That raised concerns the US Federal Reserve would raise interest rates faster than previously thought. The report on wages triggered days of volatility on the financial markets.  Bond yields climbed higher on Wednesday, but stock market reaction to the inflation report was relatively muted. After opening lower, the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq were higher by mid-afternoon. ""The fact that... losses are being trimmed, suggests that the market could be slowly starting to get to grips with the new higher inflation environment reality,"" said Fiona Cincotta, market analyst at City Index. The consumer price index is a different measure of inflation from the one the Federal Reserve typically emphasises. The Commerce Department also reported that US retail sales declined 0.3% in January, an unexpected drop that analysts said made it more difficult to draw a clear picture of the US economy.  Economists have long said they expect higher inflation in the US due to stronger economic growth and low unemployment.  But those expectations were confounded last year, as relatively soft inflation lagged the roughly 2% target set by the Federal Reserve. New data pointing to price and wage increases suggest the dynamics could be changing. On Wednesday, the US Bureau of Labour Statistics said there had been price increases across a number of areas including gasoline, clothing, medical care and food. Over the 12 months to January, inflation remained at 2.1%. The so-called core index, which strips out volatile food and energy costs, also increased 0.3% in January - the most significant rise in a year. Jacob Deppe, head of trading at online trading platform Infinox said Wednesday's report showed ""an important, albeit slight"" rise that will intensify policy questions. The Federal Reserve uses higher rates to curb inflation and has said it expects to raise rates this year. Investors worry that the bank could move too aggressively, triggering higher borrowing costs for companies and consumers that choke economic growth. New policies, including tax cuts approved last year and increased government spending, further complicate the situation, adding to the inflationary pressures. ""The fear is the Fed hikes too far, too fast,"" Mr Deppe said. ""US monetary policy will have to walk a tightrope in order not to kill off growth, while steering a path towards normal economic conditions."""
Volatility,Pay squeeze bites but unemployment dips,2024-09-25,2017-11-15,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-41996505,"Wages continue to lag behind the cost of living in the UK, while unemployment remains at a 42-year low. Workers' earnings, excluding bonuses, rose 2.2% in the three months to September compared with a year ago, the Office for National Statistics said. But they fell 0.5% in real terms when accounting for inflation, marking seven months of negative pay growth. The number of jobless - people not in work but seeking a job - fell 59,000 to 1.42 million during the period. With inflation at a five-and-a-half-year high of 3% in October, pay is failing to keep up with higher prices. The unemployment rate remained steady at 4.3% - its lowest rate since 1975 - and down from 4.8% a year earlier. Minister for Employment Damian Hinds said the unemployment figures showed the ""strength of the economy"". ""A near-record number of people are now in work,"" he said. ""Everyone should be given the opportunity to find work and enjoy the stability of a regular pay packet."" At the same time, the number of people in work dropped to 32 million, down 14,000 from the last quarter, according to ONS data. Labour MP Debbie Abrahams, shadow work and pensions secretary, said the figures were further evidence of ""Tory economic failure"".  She said: ""Both employment and real wages are falling while the price of household essentials balloons, leaving millions of people worse off than they were in 2010."" Matt Hughes, a senior ONS statistician, said employment had declined after two years of ""almost uninterrupted growth"", but was still higher than last year. The last time there was a bigger fall in employment was in April to June 2015, when the number of people in work dropped by 45,000, according to the ONS. The simultaneous drop in the number of workers and unemployed people is due to the rise in people who are classed as ""economically inactive"" - those not working and not seeking or available to work. This includes people studying, retirees, the long-term sick, or those looking after family, and rose by 117,000 to 8.8 million over the quarter.  Mr Hughes said: ""There was a rise in the number of people who were neither working nor looking for a job - so-called economically inactive people."" Separate ONS data showed a bright spot for productivity, which increased by 0.9% in the latest three months - the strongest growth rate for six years. But this follows a prolonged period of weak productivity since the financial crisis. By BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed: Any port in a storm, but it is sensible to put today's leap in productivity in context. After six months of negative figures (-0.5% January to March, -0.1% April to June), today's +0.9% jump in productivity is undoubtedly better news. But it would need at least two more quarters of similarly positive numbers to discern whether this is just normal quarter-by-quarter volatility or the first signs that the productivity slump might be starting to turn. The ONS measures productivity by dividing the number of hours worked by what is called Gross Value Added, the value of goods and services produced by the UK economy. It has leapt this quarter because working hours have fallen slightly and economic growth is higher. Whether we are actually producing more per hour worked - the key to wealth creation and better wages - will only become clear over the next six months. ONS head of productivity Philip Wales said: ""The medium-term picture continues to be one of productivity growing - but at a much slower rate than seen before the financial crisis."" The CBI's head of employment, Matthew Percival, thought the rise in productivity was ""encouraging"". He said: ""Businesses will be looking for the chancellor to cement progress in next week's Budget and maintain flexibility in the labour market, which remains a mainstay of the UK economy."" By BBC business correspondent Jonty Bloom: How can unemployment and the number of people in work drop at the same time?  The unemployment rate is a measure of those people who want to work - and cannot - but the employment rate is a measure of everyone in work.  So you could have a large number of people retiring and only some of them being replaced by unemployed people who are recruited to do their jobs.  Employment will fall, and so will unemployment.  In today's figures, the fall in employment seems to be concentrated amongst the 18-24 year olds, suggesting that part of the reason is that they are returning to education, although the figures are supposed to take such seasonal factors into account.

Volatility,"Petrol prices cannot be justified, says RAC",2024-09-25,2018-06-12,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44453931,"The RAC says the current petrol price is too high and cannot be justified. The motoring organisation is urging retailers to pass on recent falls in the wholesale cost of petrol. It says there is ""no good reason"" for keeping prices as high as they are and says petrol retailers should cut forecourt prices by 2p a litre. But a fuel retailers association said wholesale price and dollar volatility had added to pressures on independent petrol stations. Asda was the first major retailer to cut fuel prices following the RAC's claim. The supermarket giant said it had reduced the price of unleaded by up to 3p per litre and diesel by up to 2p. The new national price cap means drivers will pay no more than £1.25 per litre for unleaded and £1.28 for diesel at its 318 filling stations. The RAC says fuel prices have risen almost daily since the end of April, despite wholesale costs coming down by around 2.5p per litre since May 24. It says diesel prices have been rising for even longer, with supermarkets raising the price every single day since the 27 March. Average UK forecourt prices currently stand at £1.29 per litre for unleaded and £1.33 for diesel.  Motoring fuel prices are affected by the price of crude oil. As crude oil is priced in dollars, the exchange rate also plays a part. In May, there were record rises in the price of petrol, largely as a result of the oil price peaking at $80 and a weakening of sterling against the dollar. But since the end of last month the oil price has been falling, and so have wholesale fuel prices. RAC spokesperson Rod Dennis said: ""Our data shows that it's high time retailers cut the price of petrol and diesel at the pumps - we see no good reason for them to wait before passing on savings they are benefiting from which have been brought about by falling wholesale prices. ""Motorists really felt the impact of rising in prices in May, when the cost of filling up a petrol family car jumped by around £3.30 in a single month. We are now well into June, and drivers are still waiting for some relief to rising prices."" However, Brian Madderson, chairman of the Petrol Retailers Association, said: ""We are in the middle of one of the most volatile periods of wholesale price movements we have seen for some time."" He said the retailers will reduce prices if they think they can do, and are ""not going to price at an insult level"". However, Mr Madderson said that fluctuations in the dollar against sterling, plus requirements on retailers to add more biofuels to diesel and petrol, had helped push up prices. He added that he could only see petrol prices going up as volumes of sales fall due to the take-up of hybrid and electric cars as retailers try to maintain margins.

Volatility,'Optimism reminiscent of last crisis',2024-09-25,2018-01-23,By Joe Miller,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42791869,"The newfound optimism about the state of the global economy is eerily reminiscent of the lead-up to the last financial crisis, the head of Barclays has warned. ""I do feel like that it is a little bit like 2006,"" Jes Staley told delegates at the World Economic Forum in Davos. ""When we were all talking about whether we had solved the riddle of economic crises.""   But he said big banks were now in a better position to deal with shocks. Mr Staley's comments were delivered at the opening of an upbeat forum in the Swiss resort, at which the IMF upgraded its global growth forecast for 2018 to 3.9%. Additionally, a survey of more than 1,200 chief executives by PwC found that most believed the world economy would ""improve"" over the next 12 months. Speaking on a panel ominously entitled ""The Next Financial Crisis"", Mr Staley said that despite an encouraging recovery, ""there is something out there in the capital markets"". ""Equity markets are at an all time high and volatility is at an all time low - that is not a sustainable proposition,"" he cautioned. He hinted that if the stress tests that Barclays was subjected to by the Bank of England were applied to other sectors of the economy, they would not be found to be in rude health, primarily because of high levels of debt. Mr Staley also argued that the next financial shock would not be the fault of banks like Barclays and reiterated his faith in financial regulators. ""On one level, pre-2008, the regulators were there just to bear witness,"" he told Davos attendees. ""Today, the political body have told the regulators, I want you to regulate the system… so you avoid the next financial crisis."" Fellow banking heavyweight Michael Corbat, the chief executive of Citigroup, shared Mr Staley's view that lenders were less exposed to risk, and emphasised that they had reverted to their core mission. ""We are not an insurance company, we are not an asset manager, we are not a hedge fund,"" Mr Corbat said. ""We are simply a bank."" Harvard economist Ken Rogoff, while sanguine about the prospect of a downturn in the near future, warned that there would be few tools left to deal with one if it occurred. ""There really isn't even a Plan A for central banks,"" he said, adding that although there would be probably be further fiscal stimulus and quantitative easing, ""I don't think either would work as well as they did last time"". The risk of political upheaval, which was front and centre at last year's WEF, seems to have faded, and Donald Trump, who will bring his protectionist message to Davos on Friday, was hardly mentioned by executives. Of more concern, according to Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS Markit, were ""low-level threats"" that could end up ruining the recovery. ""The most worrisome are policy mistakes either in the United States - a fiscal shock or a trade war - or in China,"" he said, referring to overzealous interest rate rises in the former, and a rapidly reduction of debt in the latter. But Mr Behravesh added that while the risk trade friction was ""uncomfortably high"", the chances of an out-and-out trade war were still low.  Ray Nolte, managing partner at ‎investment firm SkyBridge Capital, also downplayed the prospects of another crisis, but said the harmonious nature of current economic growth was of concern. ""This really is a global recovery. Europe has really pulled out of it, the US is doing well, Asia is doing pretty well - much more coordinated than in past cycles where you have always had one country lagging, or one region lagging."" However, the very fact that the recovery was happening pretty much everywhere could spell bad news, he explained. ""What will tend to happen is countries will get out of step at the same time. This can have a cascading effect."" ""You had the US able to bail out Europe in 2011… you don't have that if everyone is in sync."" Yet Mr Nolte noted that while the global economy was motoring ahead at a steady pace - it was not yet at breakneck speed. ""It's not like we are at 4% growth and the breaks are going to have to be jammed on,"" he said. ""This party can go on for an extended period of time"". According to Prof Rogoff, anticipating precisely how the party will eventually end is no less tricky than it was 12 years ago. ""It will happen,"" he predicted, ""somewhere none of us are looking"". Citigroup, CEO Michael Corbat struck a more sombre note:  ""There is a numbness out there, there is an ambivalence out there that's concerning. ""When the next turn comes - and it will come - it's likely to be more violent than it would otherwise be."""
Volatility,"Cut fuel duty, Welsh Tories tell chancellor",2024-09-25,2022-03-17,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-60778562,"The Welsh Conservatives have called for party colleagues in Westminster to cut fuel duty in next week's spring statement. A spike in world oil prices, prompted by the invasion of Ukraine, has seen petrol and diesel costs spiral. Senedd Tories said a cut could help protect family budgets, but a motoring group questioned if it would be fully passed on. The UK government said it had frozen fuel duty for 12 years in a row. Chancellor Rishi Sunak will announce his spring statement, like a mini-budget, on Wednesday. Petrol prices have continued to rise at forecourts despite oil prices having fallen since the spike earlier this month. On Wednesday, prices for fuel stood at new records - with an average litre costing 165.40p for petrol and 176.76p for diesel. The AA said it meant that between mid-February and mid-March the cost of filling a typical 55-litre car tank leapt from £81.73 to £90.97. Despite the fall in oil prices there are concerns about the future of the world's oil supply, with the International Energy Agency warning of a potential ""global oil supply shock"" from the war and high commodity prices. Petrol prices include two taxes. Fuel duty is currently charged at 57.95 per litre, with VAT of 20% applied on top. The Welsh Tories did not specify a figure but called for duty to be lowered as prices increased. They argued that the increasing revenue VAT generates from rising prices would make up for the shortfall in cash raised by the exchequer. It is the second time in two weeks that the Welsh Conservatives have tried to pressure party colleagues in Westminster. Last week Tory Members of the Senedd (MSs) voted with Labour and Plaid Cymru MSs in calling for more action to bring Ukrainian refugees to the UK. Peter Fox, finance spokesman and MS for Monmouth, said: ""The fight for freedom is not free and we must do our best to insulate the British people from the worst of it. If we do not, we risk losing their support in this generational battle against tyranny. ""The Welsh Conservatives believe that the chancellor's spring statement provides the right opportunity to protect the increasingly tight budget of families and businesses, and this can be done by a progressive cutting of fuel duty."" Any cut to fuel duty would need to be substantial if we are to notice the difference at the pumps. Despite the wholesale cost of petrol falling last week, prices have continued to reach record highs with some forecourts charging £2 a litre. If the daily rise in prices continues, reducing fuel duty by a couple of pence would make little difference to the bills facing families and businesses when they fill the tank. But it is in the gift of the chancellor to determine duty and VAT on fuel, and with pressure from politicians and the public, it is a lever he may be tempted to pull during the spring statement. The Welsh Tories are the latest in the party this week to call for a duty cut. In the House of Commons Tory MP Jake Berry called for a cut to fuel duty, an increase in business mileage rates and a discount to vital fuel users. Mr Sunak said he would bear the suggestions in mind but said the fall in the price of oil showed the ""volatility of the situation we are currently experiencing"". The AA warned that a cut to fuel duty may not be fully felt by consumers. ""The chancellor might feel that a cut in fuel duty is likely to be lost in what should be a general fall in pump prices,"" the organisation's Luke Bosdet said. ""Anyway, with the fuel retailers' knack of coming up with reasons to hang on to chunks of potential pump-price savings, there's no guarantee that a reduction in fuel duty would be passed on in its entirety to struggling consumers."" A HM Treasury spokeswoman said: ""To keep costs down, fuel duty has been frozen for the 12th year in a row, which will save drivers around £15 every time they fill up their tank compared to pre-2010 plans. ""We're providing around £21bn this financial year and next to help families, which also includes cutting the Universal Credit taper rate, freezing alcohol duty and helping households with their energy bills through our £9.1bn Energy Bills rebate."" The Republic of Ireland cut fuel duty earlier this week by 20 cents a litre (17p) for petrol and 15 cents (13p), with the reduction due to be in place until August."
Volatility,Falkirk Council facing 'unprecedented' budget gap,2024-09-25,2022-09-28,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-tayside-central-63060000,"Falkirk Council faces an unprecedented budget gap that could lead to service cuts and council tax rises, councillors have been warned. Chief executive Kenneth Lawrie urged councillors think about a financial strategy that he said would help plan for the future. Chief finance officer Amanda Templeman said the council aims to lower spending by ""transformational projects"". The comments were made at a meeting discussing its financial strategy. Ms Templeman said the volatility of the economy meant that accurate predictions were impossible but rising interest rates would inevitably have a major impact on the council's spending plans. Conservative and Labour councillors refused to back a financial strategy that would include increasing council tax by 4% every year for five years. Ms Templeman said such an increase would help the district reach the Scottish average over a five-year period. SNP councillor Gary Bouse said that having such a low income from council tax over many years now had ""cost the council millions"". The meeting heard that while the strategy would set out the council's intentions, any rise in council tax would have to be agreed as usual at the annual budget setting meeting in February.

Volatility,Short run-in to 58% Manx Gas bill hike 'not ideal',2024-09-25,2022-04-03,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-isle-of-man-60960380,"A lack of run-in time for the introduction of a 58% hike in gas bills on the Isle of Man was ""not ideal"", the Manx Gas chief executive has said. The rise, which came into force three days after it was announced on Tuesday, was the second in recent months. Jo Cox said the recent approval of a regulatory framework for gas prices left the company little time to work through the figures before 1 April. A dramatic increase in wholesale gas prices has been blamed for the rise. It is the second increase in tariffs in recent months, after a 27.5% hike hit people's bills in December. As well as the tariff increase, customers who pay by direct debit have had the discount applied to their bills slashed from 2.5% to 1%. Ms Cox said the move was necessary to avoid those not using the direct payment system getting ""a bigger hit"" when the changes came into force. The island's monopoly provider only had ""one lever to pull"" at the moment ""because all we sell is gas"", she said, but the company was looking at extending the products it sells and was reviewing operating costs in a bid to keep future rises lower. However, she warned that the volatility in the market could last for up to another year. ""All we can do is just keep watching that market, and trying to protect ourselves in the areas of the areas that we can control so that we can bring those prices down in a different way,"" she added.

Volatility,No malpractice by council in energy mishap- report,2024-09-25,2022-07-28,By Claire Hamilton,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-merseyside-62335765,"Lack of oversight, poor communication and staff too afraid to raise the alarm caused Liverpool City Council's energy bill to soar by £10m, an inquiry has found.  Accountants Mazars examined what led to the council signing off an energy contract which turned out to be void.  However, the report found ""no evidence of malpractice or a cover-up"" by any council employee. There was also no evidence of staff ""playing the market"", it added. The specialist accountants said a combination of factors led to the council's cabinet signing off on an extension to its electricity contract with Scottish Power at a meeting on 4 March, despite the firm having already withdrawn from the commercial market.  As a result, the council was placed on a more expensive tariff. This has impacted schools and Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service (MFRS), which get their energy via council contracts. 'Systematic problems'  The cabinet had not been informed of the company's market withdrawal before it was asked to agree to the deal and the mayor and senior councillors were not made aware of the error until it was too late, the report said.   The council's chief executive, Tony Reeves, resigned earlier this month. The report said the ""chief executive officer did not have controls in place to flag major risks ahead of time"". It added that he had ""insufficient knowledge of the detail of major contracts"" and that he was ""not aware of the significant work pressures of council employees"". Mr Reeves previously told a council committee that he could not ""be expected to have granular knowledge of each council contract... and he acted as soon as he was alerted to the problem"".  Cabinet member and culture change lead, Frazer Lake, said the council's internal processes had been tightened because ""the control measures in place weren't robust enough"".  ""There was confusion around roles and responsibilities,"" he said.   Government-appointed commissioners were brought in to run parts of the council in March 2021 after inspectors found a ""serious breakdown of governance"" and ""multiple apparent failures"". Lead commissioner Mike Cunningham said the contracts issue was symptomatic of the problems at the council. ""There are human errors here. But the things that need sorting out are systematic and organisational rather than one or two mistakes,"" he said.   Mr Cunningham added: ""Liverpool City Council is still emerging from a culture where openness and transparency and clarity were not things that were celebrated, and many people operated in a culture where it wasn't safe to speak out and where you got into trouble for speaking truth to power."" The report does not say exactly how much money the mistake will have cost the council, something which Liberal Democrat leader Richard Kemp said meant the whole exercise had been a ""complete waste of money"".  ""For over £100,000, we have learned nothing that we didn't know from the Caller report,"" he said.  ""Meanwhile schools are on holiday and will return in September having to set their budgets still not knowing what impact this will have"".  Mr Lake said: ""Schools and the fire service had already budgeted for an increase due to the volatility of the energy market"", but he said any decision to pay any extra costs from council reserves would have to be made by the cabinet at a later date. Mr Cunningham said the council needed to operate with ""a greater sense of urgency"", adding: ""What we are saying is the pace of change is not what it should be and that needs to alter.""  ""This is a big organisation spending a lot of public money. It's going to be tough to turn the tanker around, it's not for the faint-hearted,"" he said.  A council spokeswoman said: ""The city council has since approved a new energy contract with Crown Commercial Services, which will run until March 2025. ""This final cost to the council, the Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service and the city's schools, of being on a variable tariff between 1 April and 30 June is expected to be reported to the council in August.""

Volatility,Barbie movie reverses Mattel's toy sales slump,2024-09-25,2023-10-25,By Natalie Sherman,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-67223711,"The head of toymaker Mattel has been saying for years that movies would help the company revive sluggish sales.  The company's latest results show just how much help is needed. Barbie billings jumped 16% in the July to September period compared with 2022, driven by the success of the first ever film starring the doll.  The gains marked a big turnaround, helping to lift the company to its first quarter of sales growth in a year.  But despite the stronger-than-expected showing, the firm still left its forecast for Christmas sales intact, reflecting the limits of the Barbie boost and worries that economic challenges will crimp spending. ""The company is operating in a challenging macro-economic environment with higher volatility, including inflation, that may impact consumer demand,"" the company told investors in its results.  Boss Ynon Kreiz has been pushing the company to invest in films and television shows as a way to re-ignite growth which has been lacklustre across the industry since a pandemic surge.  This year is likely to be no exception, he said, predicting the sales would fall industry-wide compared with 2022.  But he said Mattel was performing well under those conditions, making inroads against its competitors and improving its profit margins.  ""Our strategy is serving us well,"" he said. ""We are very well positioned competitively and expect a strong holiday season."" The Barbie movie, directed by Greta Gerwig and starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, is the top grossing film of the year so far, earning more than $1.4bn in ticket sales globally.  It was intended to help re-ignite excitement about the doll, which had seen billings decline in the first half of the year. Mattel said it expected a roughly $125m boost from movie, with much of that already realised. Other brands - including Trolls, Barney, Hot Wheels and Polly Pocket - are also set to feature in upcoming Hollywood films. Overall, Mattel said sales rose 9% in the quarter compared with 2022, hitting $1.9bn. That marked the first quarter of growth since last year.  Profits were down significantly to $146.3m. Much of the decline was due to a large rise in the company's expected taxes compared with last year.  Shares in Mattel sank more than 6% in after-hours trade."
Volatility,Saudi oil giant breaks profit record with $48.4bn,2024-09-25,2022-08-14,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-62539480,"Saudi oil giant Aramco has broken its own record with a $48.4bn (£40bn) profit for the second quarter of 2022. It is a 90% year-on-year increase and marks the biggest earnings for the world's largest energy exporter since its public listing three years ago. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has seen oil and gas prices skyrocket.  Russia is one of the world's biggest exporters but Western nations have pledged to curb their dependence on the country for their energy needs. According to Bloomberg, the Saudi oil giant's figure represents ""the biggest quarterly adjusted profit of any listed company"". As well as the record profits, the state-owned Saudi energy giant announced it would keep its dividend unchanged at $18.8bn for the third quarter. The company said it would keep expanding to satisfy demand. ""While global market volatility and economic uncertainty remain, events during the first half of this year support our view that ongoing investment in our industry is essential both to help ensure markets remain well supplied and to facilitate an orderly energy transition,"" Aramco president and chief executive Amin Nasser said. ""In fact, we expect oil demand to continue to grow for the rest of the decade, despite downward economic pressures on short-term global forecasts,"" he added. Oil prices were already rising before the Ukraine war as economies started to recover from the Covid-19 pandemic and demand outstripped supply. The world's biggest oil producers, including ExxonMobil, Chevron and BP, have all posted huge earnings this year - leading to growing calls on governments to impose a windfall tax amid an alarming rise in living costs. In June, US President Joe Biden said Exxon had made ""more money than God this year"". Saudi Arabia is the largest single producer in Opec, a group representing the world's biggest oil producers.  Last week Opec+ agreed to raise production slightly in an effort to help ease high oil prices. However, the latest production output increase is at a much slower pace than in recent months.  The decision was a blow to leaders including Mr Biden, who have called for production to be ramped up. "
Volatility,Deutsche to take €1.5bn US tax hit,2024-09-25,2018-01-05,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42584658,"Deutsche Bank will take a €1.5bn (£1.3bn) charge following changes to the US tax code, meaning it will not make a profit for 2017. The bank said its trading revenue in the fourth quarter also declined about 22% year-on-year, amid lower market volatility and less client activity. Shares in Deutsche fell nearly 6% after the announcement. The German lender also posted annual losses in 2016 and 2015. Deutsche has grappled in previous years with hefty legal costs connected to money laundering charges, among other violations, but had hoped to turn a profit in 2017.  On Friday it said the tax changes would lead to a ""small full-year after-tax loss"". Several large companies have announced one-time hits due to the changes to the US tax code that cut the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. In the long run, corporations expect to benefit from lower rates. But the switch has led many companies to revalue deferred tax assets, which are tied to deductions for past losses and can be used to reduce future tax payments.  As well as Deutsche, Morgan Stanley said it expected the changes in its deferred tax assets to lead to a $1.25bn hit."
Volatility,Ryan Giggs headbutted ex-girlfriend - court hears,2024-09-25,2022-08-08,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-62423393,"Ex-Manchester Utd and Wales star Ryan Giggs ""deliberately headbutted"" his ex-girlfriend, a court has heard. Peter Wright QC, prosecuting, told the court Mr Giggs' private life involved a ""litany of abuse, both physical and psychological"". Mr Giggs, 48, denies a charge of coercive behaviour and assaulting his ex-girlfriend and her sister. His defence counsel said the case against him was based on ""distortion, exaggeration and lies"". Mr Giggs is charged with controlling and coercive behaviour against his ex-girlfriend Kate Greville, 38, between August 2017 and November 2020. He is also charged with assaulting Ms Greville, causing her actual bodily harm, and common assault of her younger sister, Emma Greville, at his home in Worsley, Greater Manchester, on 1 November 2020. Opening his case against Mr Giggs at Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court, Mr Wright said this was a story of ""control and coercion"" of a woman who thought she was ""loved and respected"". He said his relationship with Ms Greville, 36, was ""punctuated by acts of violence and volatility"". He added Mr Giggs was ""idolised"" for his skills on the pitch but behind closed doors had ""a much uglier and more sinister side to his character"". He told the jury they will hear the relationship had ""ups and downs"" and that Mr Giggs was seeing someone else when he was with Ms Greville.  ""Eventually, after years of turbulence, when the scales fell from her eyes, she realised she needed to remove herself from his sphere of influence,"" he said. Mr Wright said this decision to break away led to the incident on 1 November 2020. Mr Giggs is said to have ""lost control"" that evening and headbutted Ms Greville. While both out with friends at Manchester's Stock Exchange Hotel, Ms Greville decided to terminate their relationship, said Mr Wright. He added Ms Greville knew Mr Giggs had ""once again"" been cheating on her, and informed her sister of her plan to end the relationship before leaving the hotel.  ""She intended to make her departure before [Mr Giggs] got back from the hotel. The plan did not work. ""As she was vacating the defendant's home address, he came back and began arguing with her and trying to stop her leaving."" In the altercation that followed, in which Ms Greville took Mr Giggs phone as a ""bargaining chip"", they grappled together on the floor before Ms Greville's sister stepped in, the court heard. Mr Wright said Emma Greville then tried to pull Mr Giggs off her sister, but he ""deliberately elbowed her in the jaw"", before the argument moved to the kitchen.  ""At that stage, we say, the defendant entirely lost self-control and he deliberately headbutted Kate, thereby causing swelling to her lips and bruising. Emma then called the police, who attended the premises."" Mr Giggs' defence team challenged the prosecution's version of events. Addressing the jury, Chris Daw QC for the defence said on a ""moral level"" his behaviour was ""far from perfect"". He told the jury some of his messages and emails were ""marked by immaturity and inappropriate language"", but this was the case for both him and Ms Greville. ""They behaved like squabbling children, playing on the insecurities of the other."" But, Mr Daw said ""no matter how rude, unpleasant and mean"" they were, there were ""lines Mr Giggs would never cross"". ""He never once used unlawful violence against Ms Greville,"" he said, adding that the case against him was based on ""distortion, exaggeration and lies.""  He said it was ""clear"" Ms Greville's injuries were not consistent with a head butt from ""a strong and physically fit man"".  Referring to the incident on 1 November 2020, Mr Daw said Mr Giggs and Ms Greville both tripped and fell to the floor in the kitchen of his home and that she kicked him in the face as he tried to disentangle himself.  Mr Daw added Mr Giggs was not aware the complainant's sister was in the house at the time and did not elbow her, as alleged. The alleged headbutt was ""not only a nasty lie but a ridiculous one,"" he said, as evidence in the trial will show there was ""minor and accidental contact"" between their faces. Mr Daw said in the weeks before, Ms Greville told friends she was determined not to walk away from the relationship with nothing. He added Mr Giggs had encouraged Ms Greville's career ambitions in PR, backed her with his own company, and introduced clients.  She was always financially independent, free to travel and see her friends as much as she wanted, he told the court. ""Both could be childish,"" he said. On nights out, they would often block each other's numbers.  ""Immaturity is not a crime,"" he added, and when it comes to law and morality, ""law is what matters"".  Mr Wright, QC for the prosecution, also told the jury the abuse from Mr Giggs was ""interspersed with acts of kindness and contrition"". He said Mr Giggs would say she had misunderstood him, had jumped to the wrong conclusion and that he was the victim. ""We say this was controlling and coercive behaviour,"" he added. ""This was a behaviour to gaslight her, and make her pliant and compliant."" He said the behaviour was ""calculated"", and was ""conduct that would have an obvious and serious effect on her emotionally and physically"". Standing in the dock, wearing a dark grey suit, Mr Giggs listened to the opening statements and watched as the jury of seven women and five men was selected and sworn in for the trial. The jury was told witnesses in the case will include former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson and former player Gary Neville. The trial - expected to last around 10 days - will relocate to Manchester Crown Court from Tuesday and remain there for the duration. Mr Giggs has denied all charges - the trial continues. "
Volatility,'Lampard a unity candidate to heal division',2024-09-25,2022-01-31,Phil McNulty,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/60189940,"This video can not be played It's an honour to manage Everton - Lampard This time a year ago, Frank Lampard was coming to terms with his brutal sacking as Chelsea manager after his return to Stamford Bridge, which held so much promise, turned sour. Now Lampard, a Chelsea icon as the club's all-time leading scorer, is preparing to take charge of another of English football's great institutions in vastly different circumstances.  Twelve months on from his Chelsea dismissal, Lampard assumes control as Everton manager with the Merseyside club mired in supporter unrest and sinking like a stone towards the Premier League relegation zone after the ill-advised and short-lived reign of Rafael Benitez. The former England midfielder has waited for his moment to return, and after a chaotic recruitment process, Everton owner Farhad Moshiri has alighted on the unity candidate to lift spirits and heal divisions at Goodison Park. Lampard appointed Everton manager Van de Beek to join Everton on loan Rooney turned down Everton approach ""Sensible"" is not a word much associated with Everton in recent times as Moshiri's high-risk strategy of appointing former Liverpool manager Benitez in the face of supporter suspicion and reservations in his own boardroom went wrong.  The arrival of Lampard, an intelligent thinker on the game with a forward-looking approach, could redress the balance.  Moshiri may have taken the scenic route in his managerial search, but there is a feeling inside Everton that he may have arrived at the right destination.  Once Benitez was sacked after the 2-1 defeat at Norwich City, Everton turned to Belgium coach and former manager Roberto Martinez - a move laced with irony because he was the first of five men in charge who have been sacked by Moshiri. Martinez's dismissal in May 2016 came amid the sort of fan protests that have been seen again in recent times.  Former striker Wayne Rooney declined to enter the pageant of candidates for an interview, instead opting to stay at Derby County. So it boiled down to Lampard, Portuguese coach Vitor Pereira and current caretaker manager Duncan Ferguson.  Pereira was initially Moshiri's favoured choice, but he also became a target for fan anger along with agent Kia Joorabchian, who Everton fans feel exerts too much influence over Moshiri's thinking. The reaction put Moshiri on the back foot, leaving 53-year-old Pereira to re-enact his job interview and state his case in a 20-minute live TV interview, which actually appeared to do his chances more harm than good.  It allowed Lampard back into the race, and once a final round of interviews was conducted on Friday, the job was his.  Lampard is already a popular choice with supporters who are distrustful of the decision-making progress at Everton. His popularity is a big plus for Moshiri and chairman Bill Kenwright, who has also been under heavy fire from fans. Moshiri could not afford another Benitez-style corrosive appointment, which Pereira was shaping up to be - so Lampard may turn out to be the best man available to Everton in a limited field.  Frank Lampard was sacked by Chelsea last season, before the Blues went on to win the Champions League Lampard has used his year out of the game to spend more time with his family but also to prepare for his comeback. Now he can make that comeback at Everton, with its history and tradition plus a fierce and passionate fanbase who will relate to him as one of the finest players of the modern era.  In fact, the Lampard family already has a strong, albeit rather painful, connection with Everton. Frank Lampard Sr scored a famous headed winner deep into extra time in the 1980 FA Cup semi-final when West Ham went on to win the trophy.  And Everton's new manager scored the winning goal when Chelsea beat the Toffees in the 2009 FA Cup final. He has been linked with jobs regularly in his absence and is intelligent enough to have learned from his demise at Chelsea, where it should be stated he finished fourth and reached an FA Cup final in his one full season while operating under a transfer embargo and after the loss of his biggest game-changer, Eden Hazard.  Lampard will bring a stronger coaching team to Everton and will be armed with the experience of dealing with big players, egos, expectation and an owner who can react with volatility and speed to bad results.  And, as someone so closely associated with success, Lampard will want to correct the harsh impression that his time at Chelsea was a failure when much of it was a source of credit in the circumstances. The 43-year-old admitted his pride took a hit with his Chelsea sacking, so Everton are getting a man and a manager with a point to prove, on a mission to set the record straight after a rare blemish on a glittering career. Well, the ""in tray"" will have to be large to fit everything in.  Lampard arrives with the immediate plus of being welcomed by fans after the toxicity of the latter days of Benitez. For all the talk of supporters refusing to give Benitez a chance, any manager would have been in trouble with only six points from a possible 39.  And therein lies Lampard's priority. He must somehow galvanise a team that has looked unfit for purpose and that has mentally disintegrated in the past few weeks, too often unable to cope with adversity and being frequently overrun in a wretched series of results.  Duncan Ferguson impressed during a first spell in caretaker charge in 2019 but his second stint has been short lived Caretaker boss Ferguson could not inspire the required bounce in the home loss to Aston Villa, but a fresh pair of eyes with no previous connection to the club or psychological baggage may be beneficial.  Everton will face Brentford in the FA Cup fourth round at Goodison Park next weekend before what can now be termed a relegation battle at Newcastle United, a home meeting with Leeds United and a visit to Southampton.  He must hope his key strikers Richarlison and Dominic Calvert-Lewin stay fit together, a luxury Benitez was rarely afforded; find a way to bolster a midfield that will be missing key figure Abdoulaye Doucoure for the next four weeks; and restore the shattered confidence in Everton's defence.  Lampard deserves real credit for his determination to use youth both at Derby County and particularly at Chelsea, where he mentored and developed players including Mason Mount, Tammy Abraham, Fikayo Tomori and Reece James, all now England internationals.  He will find a fine emerging talent at Everton in winger Anthony Gordon and Scotland's 20-year-old right-back Nathan Patterson, who has just arrived from Rangers. There was also a rare piece of good news this week when highly rated 19-year-old forward Lewis Dobbin signed a new contract after fears he might be lured away from Goodison Park.  Jarrad Branthwaite, also 19, showed his potential with a towering defensive performance and a goal in the 1-1 draw at Chelsea in December.  If these youngsters deserve selection, Lampard will reward them, and his status as a player of recent vintage who claimed all the big prizes at Chelsea means they are likely to look up to their new manager. Ferguson, whose hopes of being appointed manager were dashed, will now work on the backroom staff of his seventh Everton manager, seemingly happy to operate in the shadows rather than leave the Goodison Park bubble to prove his credentials elsewhere. What influence he wields remains to be seen as Lampard surrounds himself with an experienced backroom team including Paul Clement, the former Derby County and Swansea City manager who worked alongside former Everton manager Carlo Ancelotti at Chelsea, Paris St-Germain, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich, as well new assistant manager Joe Edwards, who has moved to Merseyside from Chelsea. Lampard will work to repair recent fractures in relationships with Everton fans, and his personality and stature are powerful weapons in that pursuit.  What he needs first and foremost, though, is a fast start with good results to put his new club's season back in some sort of shape and ease those growing fears of a relegation fight.  It is a huge challenge - but exactly the kind of one Lampard has been waiting 12 months for.

Volatility,Reduction of energy bill help criticised by Murphy,2024-09-25,2022-10-17,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-63286040,"The UK government's plan to scale back support for energy bills is ""flawed"", Northern Ireland Finance Minister Conor Murphy has said. He made the comments after new Chancellor Jeremy Hunt revealed his financial plans on Monday. The Energy Support Scheme, which originally capped household energy bills at £2,500 for two years from 1 October, will now be reviewed in April. Mr Murphy said many households would be worried. ""It is clear the chancellor is firmly on the road back to austerity,"" he said. ""At a time when public services are under immense pressure the government should be investing in them not indicating spending cuts."" Mr Hunt, who was appointed as chancellor on Friday, said the support would be reviewed so it cost ""significantly less than planned"". But he said he would ensure there was enough support for those most in need. The chancellor added it would be ""irresponsible for the government to continue exposing the public finances to unlimited volatility in international gas prices"". Mr Murphy called on the government to recognise the ""extreme hardship"" some of the most vulnerable in society were facing. ""The cost-of-living crisis is having a profound impact on households and families who deserve some certainty around their future financial outlook,"" he said. ""It is already a stressful time for people, with many facing rising mortgage costs as a result of the chaotic mini-budget."" On Monday, it was announced the government would reverse almost all tax measures introduced in its mini-budget three weeks ago. It includes shelving planned cuts to the basic rate of income tax to 19%. The details of an earlier £400 energy support payment have not yet been finalised for Northern Ireland. However, it will require new legislation to be passed as Northern Ireland has a separate energy system and policies introduced in Great Britain do not automatically apply."
Volatility,GameStop: Who is winning the market battle?,2024-09-25,2021-01-29,By Natalie Sherman,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-55864608,"Financial markets have been riveted by the tale of novice investors taking on Wall Street pros by buying up shares of US video games retailer GameStop, which many hedge funds had seen as a losing bet. It's an apparently crowd-sourced attempt to beat billionaire traders at their own game. But who's really winning and losing this battle? GameStop, a loss-making chain of bricks-and-mortar shops, saw shares jump from being worth less than $20 each at the end of December to nearly $350 on Wednesday. The surge has been attributed to a swarm of independent traders, swapping tips on social media, who saw an opportunity to pressure Wall Street hedge funds that had made deals assuming GameStop's share price would fall - and would have to purchase shares to cover losses if the stock rose more than expected.  That, in turn, could generate a kind of buying frenzy - and chance for gains for the little guys. In recent weeks, they've deployed the strategy on behalf of other firms, such as struggling theatre chain AMC Entertainment, owner of Odeon Cinemas.  And the idea has caught on globally, fuelling activity in stocks traded in other parts of the world, including the UK, Brazil and Malaysia. The social media forums where the amateur day-traders stoked enthusiasm for GameStop are full of snapshots showing how their bets have performed -  in some cases growing from tiny sums to positions worth millions of dollars. But for many, these are just gains on paper - and could still end in big losses if the prices fall back. On Thursday, after the wacky market conditions prompted some trading platforms, such as Robinhood, to restrict purchases, shares dipped.  Some traders posted comments confessing to nerves at the prospect of losses, while rallying their fellows to hold the line and avoid selling, staving off a sudden price collapse. And on Friday, GameStop shares rose again, climbing 68% to $325 apiece, even as the market overall dropped. If prices drop back, however, some who bought in too late will be hurt. The buying frenzy has reportedly led to losses for some big name hedge funds, including Point72, a firm run by infamous investor Steve Cohen, a billionaire art collector and owner of the New York Mets baseball team whose first hedge fund, SAC Capital, pleaded guilty to insider trading charges and shut down.  Some of the losses this week stemmed from Point72 money being managed by Melvin Capital, a company founded by a former SAC star trader, which had made big bets against Gamestop and was forced to pull out of the trade. Other firms reportedly hit include Maplelane Capital and DI Capital, while other prominent short sellers have said  they - and their families - have been subject to harassment. Analysts also say the pressure on hedge funds is one force behind broader declines in US markets in recent days, as firms sell other investments to cover their losses. Mr Cohen, whose firm helped provide rescue funding to Melvin Capital amid the upheaval, has appeared to allude to the strains caused by the Reddit army, writing on Twitter: ""Hey stock jockeys keep bringing it"". That's not to say there aren't investing pros benefiting from the battle against the short-sellers - many of which are still betting stocks will fall. Firms like investment giant Fidelity and BlackRock, which own more than 10% of GameStop shares, have seen the value of their holdings rise.  The surge also benefited Ryan Cohen, an entrepreneur who sold his online pet retail company Chewy to Petsmart in 2017 and revealed a major investment in GameStop last year. Executives at some companies favoured by the day traders, such as BlackBerry, have gotten windfalls from selling their shares. It's creating opportunities for other kinds of companies too. For example, private equity firm Silver Lake Group, which had loaned money to AMC Entertainment, converted its bonds to shares after the surge in the firm's prices, a swap worth hundreds of millions of dollars.  In other ways, however, the episode could bode ill for Wall Street in Washington, where Democrats now claim slim majorities and Congress was already eying tax hikes for hedge funds.  Senator Elizabeth Warren, a prominent voice in favour of tougher rules, has said the episode warrants wider investigation, pointing to fault on both sides of the battle, which she said was a sign of market distortions that could put the rest of the economy at risk.  Regulators already had their eyes on Robinhood, an app used to buy and sell shares that has seen its popularity explode amid the pandemic.  The Silicon Valley company, which makes money in part from fees charged to Wall Street funds that execute customer orders, is accused of courting inexperienced investors and encouraging them to trade frequently and deploy risky strategies - even if it goes against customer interests. This episode has only intensified regulator scrutiny. Meanwhile, the firm said late Thursday it had raised more than $1bn amid questions about financial strains on the firm created by the buying frenzy.  It's also facing outrage from customers - and lawmakers - angry after Robinhood was among the trading platforms to limit purchases of Gamestop and others' stocks, citing market volatility and risk. Many of the companies whose shares have been championed by day traders in the battle against the short-sellers are what have been dubbed ""90s nostalgia stocks"" - firms buffeted by changes wrought technology, like the decline of traffic to bricks and mortar shops and cinemas.  The pandemic has only hammered them harder. GameStop, which was founded in 1996 and now has more than 5,000 stores in the US, Canada, Australia and elsewhere, saw sales fall 30% in the first nine months of 2020.  AMC Entertainment, the owner of Odeon Cinemas, meanwhile, warned last month it risked running out of cash, after traffic to its theatres plunged last year. Some of those firms have seized opportunities created by the recent trading to ease financial strains. AMC, for example, raised more than $300m by selling shares this week and has said it is exploring additional offerings. American Airlines has said it is also planning to sell shares. But regardless of what happens next in the financial markets, the challenges facing them in the real world aren't going away."
Volatility,Online students would still face full tuition fees,2024-09-25,2020-05-03,By Sean Coughlan,https://www.bbc.com/news/education-52506283,"University students in England will still have to pay full tuition fees even if their courses are taught online in the autumn, the government has said. ""We don't believe students will be entitled to reimbursement if the quality is there,"" universities minister Michelle Donelan said. But the university sector's request for a £2bn bail-out has been rejected. Universities had warned of financial danger from a reduction in overseas students because of coronavirus. University campuses have been closed by the pandemic - and there is uncertainty for students whether there will be in-person teaching in the autumn or whether courses will be taught fully or partly online. The universities minister said no formal decision had been taken on the next academic year, but if courses are taught online and ""students are really getting the quality, and they're getting a course which is fit for purpose"", they would not get a discount on fees. ""Universities are still continuing with their overheads and their expenses during this time, and it's no fault of their own,"" she said. If students were not getting adequate teaching online, she said there were processes for them to complain. Jake, an accountancy student in Leeds, told the BBC that charging full fees for online courses was so unfair that it made him want to drop out. ""There has clearly been no consideration of students with this decision. I pay tuition fees to go to my university in person, to be taught at my university in person, to access the facilities of the university - libraries, societies, sports facilities - in person.  ""Expecting students to pay full fees for a service that they aren't receiving is frankly insulting,"" he said. Rose, an international student from India studying in Manchester, said getting lessons online was not an adequate alternative - and regretted paying so much for her course. ""It's been a nightmare. First of all we had two strikes which lasted three to four weeks at a time and now this. ""I paid £19,000 for my course. We're not a rich family. That's all the money my family have. I feel so guilty for using it all up for this."" Isobel, another student in Manchester, contacted the BBC to say: ""There has been no talk about a refund for the lack of lectures.  ""I am finding it difficult not being able to access libraries, and ask questions. Yes, I know you can email stuff to lecturers but they're swamped."" An unimpressed student, Livi, posted on Twitter: ""So by September I'll have lost almost £3,000 to rent a house I'm not even living in, and tuition fees will still be max even if it's online - something about this seems unfair."" Tom Kendall, a member of the UK Youth Parliament, said: ""If we have to stay home and complete online lectures what about the students who are less fortunate and don't have a laptop or access to wi-fi?"" As well as weighing up whether they want to study online, applicants will be waiting for information on how a reopened campus might function, in terms of social distancing, social activities and student accommodation. The National Union of Students has highlighted how difficult it can be for current students to study online, with some struggling with a lack of computer equipment and broadband access and not having enough space in which to work. A study from the Sutton Trust suggests some applicants are reconsidering their university plans, in a year group that has already seen exams cancelled and replaced by estimated grades. There is a ""huge degree of worry and uncertainty,"" says trust founder, Sir Peter Lampl. There are particular financial worries for universities about an expected drop in overseas students, who pay a higher level of fees. Last month, Universities UK called for at least £2bn in emergency funding, saying that otherwise some institutions could go bust. Ms Donelan has announced measures to stabilise university finances, but without the extra cash requested. To help with cash flow, £2.6bn of tuition fee income and £100m of research funding will be brought forward and universities will be able to access the Treasury's support for businesses disrupted by coronavirus, worth another £700m. ""Should providers require further support the government will continue to review their financial circumstances,"" said the universities minister. There will also be more flexibility in the clearing system, which matches applicants to empty places after results are issued. Universities have been worried about ""volatility"" in applications and that some universities could be so short of recruits they would be financially unviable. To stop such fluctuations, there will be controls on student numbers, designed to stop some universities adding many more students, while others could be be left with too few. The higher education watchdog, the Office for Students, said it would impose financial penalties on universities using pressure selling tactics ""to increase student intake beyond normal levels"". The Russell Group of leading universities said the ""big remaining challenge"" was funding for research. ""Universities face significant shortfalls in international students and other sources of income that we need to underpin vital work that otherwise goes under-funded,"" said chief executive, Tim Bradshaw. Universities UK said the stability measures were a recognition of the important part universities would play in the ""recovery of the economy and communities"" in the wake of the pandemic and the ""severe financial storm"" it had created. The universities body has said that in the forthcoming weeks current students and applicants will be given a clearer idea of arrangements for opening in the autumn."
Volatility,32Red's £2m penalty for problem gambler,2024-09-25,2018-06-20,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44544950,"Online gambling operator 32Red has been hit with a £2m penalty for failing to protect a problem gambler. One customer was allowed to deposit £758,000 with the firm with no money laundering or social responsibility  checks. The Gambling Commission said the penalty also related to money laundering failures.  Kindred, which owns 32Red, said it accepted the penalty and was ""working hard"" to improve its processes.   The Gambling Commission's investigation focused on 32Red's dealings with the customer between November 2014 and April 2017 during which time there were at least 22 incidents indicating the customer was a problem gambler. ""Instead of checking on the welfare of a customer displaying problem gambling behaviour, 32Red encouraged the customer to gamble more - this is the exact opposite of what they are supposed to be doing,"" said Richard Watson, the commission's executive director said. ""Operators must take action when they spot signs of problem gambling and should be carefully reviewing all the customers they are having a high level of contact with."" There had also been previous incidents highlighting the gambler's problems but instead of scrutinising these, the customer was offered bonuses to carry on placing bets. The Gambling Commission said 32Red should have reviewed the customer's accounts in August 2016 but one was only conducted in January 2017, when a win of more than £1m was instantly gambled again.  The customer took five weeks to respond to requests about their financial position and failed to offer support when the information was provided, the commission said. The payslip and report of commission for work was ""not credible and showed volatility in receipted income"", according to the Gambling Commission. These showed a monthly net income of £13,000 but average monthly deposits were in excess of £45,000. The customer's average monthly net salary was actually £2,150. The £2m penalty includes £709,046 divestment of the financial gain, a £1.3m payment to be used on the National Responsible Gambling Strategy, intended to tackle problem gambling, and £15,000 towards the cost of the investigation. Asked if the customer had stolen the money to gamble, the Gambling Commission  spokesman said: ""The source of the customer's wealth was not known to 32Red because they failed to fulfil their anti-money laundering obligations. We cannot comment on any other proceedings that may be active.""  The largest penalty imposed by the Gambling Commission was the £7.8m penalty on betting firm 888 in August 2017. 32Red was taken over by Kindred, a Swedish online betting company, in June 2017."
Volatility,Unemployment rate rises most in Wales,2024-09-25,2018-01-24,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-42802911,"Unemployment has risen again in Wales, in the latest monthly figures issued by the Office for National Statistics. The jobless rate is 4.9%, an increase of 0.8% in the three months to November - the highest proportional rise of any nation and region.  The employment rate is 72.7%, an increase on the previous three months but below the UK average of 75.3%.  The highest UK unemployment rate was in the West Midlands (5.5%) and the lowest was in south east England (3.0%). Only the West Midlands, London, Yorkshire and the Humber had seen a rise in the unemployment rate, along with Wales. The latest rise is an increase on the previous month's rate, which was 4.7% for the three month period. The UK unemployment rate remains steady at 4.3%. There are now 73,000 people out of work in Wales, up 13,000 on the previous three month period. This is 7,000 more than the same time a year ago. The unemployment rate for south east, along with the north east and north west of England are all at record or joint record lows. The ONS said the ""general picture across the UK, allowing for some individual volatility, is still an overall pattern of flat or gently falling unemployment rates"". The figures also show we are working longer hours in Wales -  an increase of half an hour a week compared to the previous year. First Minister Carwyn Jones said the latest figures showed the employment rate was 0.3% up on the year and economic inactivity rate was also moving ""in the right direction"". ""We remain committed to doing all we can to drive up employment levels across Wales and today we have announced a new £2.5m EU-backed scheme to help unemployed people to overcome barriers into work,"" he said.  Mr Jones said the Welsh Government was also working hard to support employers to locate to and expand within Wales and he pointed to 275 new jobs at travel company TUI and global professional services company AON.  Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns said: ""While I welcome the increase in the number of people in work and the fall in the economic inactivity rate, we must redouble our efforts to halt the rise in unemployment."" He said the UK government was working hard to create the right conditions for growth and maximising opportunities to strengthen cross-border links ""but this must be a coordinated action across governments and industry at all levels""."
Volatility,The PM's troubles have left Labour buoyant,2024-09-25,2022-09-28,By Chris Mason,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-63055831,"""Plenty will tell you it's a good idea to bury your differences. But in the Labour Party we like to bury our similarities!""  Labour's former leader Ed Miliband is in ebullient mood. He leans back in his chair, headphones on, chuckling, talking to us on the BBC's Newscast podcast a few hours after Keir Starmer's speech to this year's Labour Conference. Now the shadow secretary of state for climate change and net zero, he knows what losing feels like and he's been around long enough to see his party do its fair share of internal bickering. He, like others in Liverpool, are convinced something has now changed. And there is, undoubtedly, a buoyancy here. A buoyancy borne of banishing the internal squabbles of the past; floating too on the self made troubles of the new prime minister. People here have looked on open mouthed on what's happened in the last few days in the markets and are worried about the consequences. But they are excited about the political chance they hope it might give them. Sir Keir Starmer calculates Liz Truss has chosen to sail away from the seas upon which an election can be won; he wants to be seen to be tacking straight towards them. ""This stuff with that budget the other day means we can say the Tories are the bogeymen. They're doing just what we always accuse them of, helping the rich!"" said one shadow cabinet minister. Sir Keir's speech was not just a transparent repudiation of the era of Jeremy Corbyn - a man, remember, he served alongside and who he campaigned to make prime minister - it was also a naked embrace of the instincts, even the language of Tony Blair. But even his biggest supporters acknowledge privately he doesn't have what they saw a generation ago as Sir Tony's ease on the stage or capacity to personify an era. ""He's not got that zeitgeisty thing that Tony had,"" one senior figure loyal to Sir Keir admits to me. One phrase used by some in Keir Starmer's circle is ""hero voters"" - a reference to people who have previously abandoned Labour but are now willing to return. Those tasked with trying to talk to them and persuade them tell me the party still has a way to go to introduce Sir Keir and what he stands for to them. They'll hope this speech goes some way to do that. But one said it may not properly happen until a general election campaign, when the coverage of party leaders steps up and voters are paying more attention. Some in the party fear by then it could be too late. Oh, and incidentally, some senior figures hate the phrase ""hero voters"", thinking it is a patronising phrase that belongs in a nerdy Westminster presentation, if that, and certainly not for use more widely. Not least because it suggests long time, loyal Labour voters are somehow less than heroic. There was a conscious attempt by Labour to ensure the leader's speech was not the rhetorical equivalent of ""comfort eating"" as it was put to me: in other words, talking about stuff that is comfortable ground for Labour activists, such as the NHS. The focus instead was on the economy. I'm told there wasn't a big re-write in the light of events of the last few days. And it is true to say that since at least the spring Sir Keir and his team have been talking about how they saw sluggish economic growth as being at the root of plenty of the UK's problems. And remember, for so long the economy has been perceived by many as an Achilles heel for Labour. But there is no doubt their desire to embrace it has been emboldened by the reaction to the government's budget the other day. When, in government, there is nervousness about talking about what is going on, and there is nervousness about not talking about what is going on, it tells you one thing: they are not in control of events. It tells you the government has been a reluctant passenger on this big dipper of market volatility that it strapped itself and the rest of us into. Tory MPs worry that this could be the moment that mugs them of their reputation. And Labour hopes to pocket and run off with the consequences of that. But a couple of final thoughts worth bearing in mind. If I switch from the maritime metaphors from above to a mountainous one now, Labour's challenge ahead is Himalayan in height. And it took them a while even to get to sea level. The result at the last general election was their worst in nearly a century; the worst since 1935. And the last time Labour won a general election, 17 years ago, they won 41 seats in Scotland. At the last election, they won... one. And the Scottish National Party's near monopoly of Scotland's Westminster seats shows little sign of immediate significant retreat. Reaching that snowy summit for Labour is still some way off. And one more thing: even if they were to manage it, and Sir Keir Starmer became prime minister, it wouldn't be the calm, economic serenity of 1997 when Tony Blair arrived in power. It'd be far, far more choppy. Reaching 10 Downing Street will be difficult. Governing in the mid 2020s could prove even harder."

He told the Associated Press the ""need for mental health in America has skyrocketed"". Mr Biden said he wanted Americans to ""be confident. Because I am confident.""  The president's popularity has plunged as November elections loom that will decide which party controls Congress. ""People are really, really down,"" Mr Biden told the news agency in a half-hour interview from the Oval Office on Thursday. ""They're really down. Their need for mental health in America has skyrocketed because people have seen everything upset.  ""Everything they counted on upset.

And then, were they going to get back to work? Schools were closed.""  Mr Biden spoke to the news agency amid complaints from members of the White House press corps about their lack of access to him.  Asked about the possibility of the US economy dipping into recession, the Democratic president insisted it was ""not inevitable"".  He also called arguments that his $1.9tn coronavirus aid package had sparked inflation ""bizarre"". Mr Biden had initially discounted warnings from economists that his spending could overheat the economy, before insisting when inflation arrived that it would be ""temporary"", only to acknowledge in recent days that elevated consumer prices will persist ""for a while"". Last month, inflation in the US hit 8.6% - one of the highest rates in the world. During the interview, the AP said Mr Biden became defensive when asked about this issue. ""If it's my fault,"" he said, ""why is it the case in every other major industrial country in the world that inflation is higher? You ask yourself that? I'm not being a wise guy."" A Fox News reporter challenged the White House press secretary about this claim on Thursday, pointing out that inflation is currently lower in other top economies such as Germany, France, Italy, Japan, Canada and India."

Work on the road started in 2018 and was due to be completed in the Autumn but has been beset by delays.  The DfI's Kaine Lynch told BBC Radio Foyle he now estimates the project to run £30m over their initial budget.  Earlier on Wednesday, he said work on the road will likely be finished ""by the end of April"". Mr Lynch said that estimated date is ""subject to any unforeseen circumstances"". The 15-mile (24km) stretch is part of the A6 road that links Derry and Belfast. It was due to open last Autumn but there has been concerns over continued delays to the scheme. The new stretch of road mostly runs parallel to the existing road and includes of a bypass of Dungiven. ""When we originally started the project we estimated it would cost around £220m, we know that it is likely to be in the region of £250m today,"" Mr Lynch told BBC Radio Foyle's News at One.  ""But there are a number of outstanding disputes and unagreed items with the contractor which would need to be resolved before we could get a final figure. ""In a construction project of this nature there is inevitably things that will arise that the contractor would not have reasonably foreseen or accounted for in the price. ""There are a large a number of minor issues that are yet to be resolved, but that is normal on a project of this scale so my best estimate is now around £30m extra."" The road opened with speed limits and lane restrictions for a short period in summer 2022, but then later closed again as work continued. Speaking to BBC's Good Morning Ulster on Wednesday morning, Mr Lynch said he understood the concerns of ""local people and the travelling public"" about delays to the project.  ""They have waited a long time for the upgrade and understandably want to know when it will open,"" he said.   He said ""the end of April"" was the target the DfI was now working towards to open the road to the public. "
Volatility,Commodities' volatility continues,2024-09-25,2011-05-06,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-13305462,"This video can not be played Watch: Harold Wheeldon says 'oil reflects slight easing of tension in Middle East' Commodity prices have seen large swings, falling sharply at first before fully recovering. Brent crude oil initially fell 5.8% to $105.15 a barrel, adding to an 8.6% drop on Thursday, before recovering to above $110 by mid-afternoon. The rebound in the price of major raw materials was given a boost by strong US jobs data, which also pushed European stock markets up by nearly 1%. The volatility comes a day after one of the biggest market sell-offs in years. The sell-off affected most types of commodity. Industrial metals saw further sharp swings on Friday. Copper futures fell a further 1.75%, following a 6% slide a day earlier, before recovering. Meanwhile, the price of US sweet, light crude oil fell a further 5.5% on Friday morning to $94.63 a barrel, but then recovered to around $98, where it remained steady until late into the evening.  Prices of precious metals - such as gold and silver - held steady during the morning, despite having previously followed other commodities sharply lower during Thursday's market rout. However, silver prices suffered another wobble, briefly down 5%. The price of silver has fallen more than 30% since it hit an all-time high last week. Stock markets also proved resilient. After falling slightly at the start of trade, European stock markets recovered and pushed higher, rising further when figures showed that more jobs than expected had been created in the US in April. Thursday's commodity price rout was prompted by disappointing data on US benefit claims and German industrial orders. The dollar also remained stable against other currencies on Friday, in contrast with Thursday, when a sharp rise in the greenback contributed towards the fall in commodity prices, which are measured in dollars. Analysts warn the volatility in the markets could remain. ""When you have this kind of damage, it will take several weeks, or maybe several months... for confidence to be rebuilt,"" said Dennis Gartman, author of a markets guide. ""It's not the end of the commodities cycle, not even close. You still have to call this a correction. It's a sizable one and scared the heck out of everybody."" However, other analysts suggest that it could mark the beginning of a more sustained fall. Emma Pinnock, energy analyst at Inenco, sees the oil price dropping back below $100 a barrel within days if not sooner, as markets realign supply and demand. ""Ultimately the price increases that we saw of almost 12% since the beginning of 2011, due to instability in the Middle East, the Japanese earthquake and the nuclear crisis, were not sustainable,"" she said. ""The poor economic data released from the US and Europe has confirmed fears that the recent high commodity prices could affect global demand."""
Volatility,Obituary: Robert Hardy,2024-09-25,2017-08-03,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-13783739,"With his instantly recognisable voice and British bulldog manner, Robert Hardy enjoyed a distinguished acting career which spanned eight decades. By the time he endeared himself to television audiences in the BBC's All Creatures Great and Small, he had already carved out a reputation as one of Britain's most versatile actors. While his earlier career gave him a firm grounding in the theatre his best known roles were in front of the camera - particularly in television, a medium he obviously enjoyed.  He became something of a specialist in the role of Sir Winston Churchill, playing the great man on half a dozen occasions as well as being in demand to reproduce the wartime leader's voice. Timothy Sydney Robert Hardy was born in Cheltenham on 29 October 1925. The youngest of a large family, he was a self-professed ""odd child"". His father was the headmaster of Cheltenham College and Hardy himself went to Rugby School before going up to Magdalen College, Oxford to read English. It was while at Oxford that he struck up an enduring friendship with a fellow student, Richard Burton and both men found their studies interrupted when they were called up and posted to an RAF station in Norfolk. Robert Hardy as Henry V in a 1960 BBC production Unlike Burton, Hardy returned to Oxford after his war service and gained a BA (Hons) in English as well as having enjoyed the opportunity to study under two of Oxford's most eminent names, JRR Tolkien and CS Lewis. He had always been fascinated by Hollywood films and had determined to become an actor, joining the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre in 1949.  He was once asked what was needed to be successful in such a competitive profession. ""A certain amount of talent, luck, a spine of steel, a ruthlessness of mind that does not jib at murder and patience,"" he replied. He was much in demand as a stage actor during the 1950s mainly playing Shakespearean roles, although he did make his first foray into cinema in 1958 playing a naval officer in the Glenn Ford film Torpedo Run.  He turned down Sir Peter Hall's offer of a contract with the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1960, complaining that it was for middle-of-the-roadish parts. ""I stormed at him one day and I behaved extremely badly,"" he said. He was reunited with his friend Richard Burton in the 1965 film, The Spy Who Came In From the Cold, where he played the role of Dick Carlton.  A year later he was given his first continuing role as the ruthless businessman Alex Stewart in the BBC production, The Troubleshooters, a drama based on a fictitious oil company called Mogul.  In 1978, Hardy took the part of the irascible but good-natured Siegfried Farnon in All Creatures Great and Small, the long-running BBC series based on James Herriot's best-selling books. As the senior vet of the small Yorkshire Dales practice, Robert Hardy became one of the best-known faces on British television. Robert Hardy, Carol Drinkwater and Christopher Timothy in All Creatures Great and Small Full of animals, nostalgia and rural scenery, the show became a massive hit, attracting audiences of up to 20 million.  The original run ended in 1978 but the series was revived 10 years later after the BBC obtained permission to write new storylines, having exhausted the original James Herriot books. But the new scripts failed to meet with Hardy's approval and he rewrote large parts of his dialogue. ""All they did was make Siegfried explode and be bad-tempered. I kept changing things."" Hardy cornered the market in the role of blustering aristocrat, often dressed in tweed.  He appeared in The Far Pavilions, The Cleopatras, Bramwell and Middlemarch, and on the big screen in The Shooting Party and Sense and Sensibility. He explained: ""When you've lived a goodish span as I have, it's a case of roaming round the attic and borrowing a few characters."" Despite this range, Robert Hardy's own volatility and ability to express his wrath were channelled most successfully into his many portrayals of Britain's most revered premier.  He played Winston Churchill many times, even once in French on stage in Paris, but most memorably in the 1981 mini-series The Wilderness Years.  Hardy said himself of his complete immersion into the character, ""My family complained loudly about my behaviour while I was playing him.""  Hardy played Sir Toby Belch in the BBC's Twelfth Night He was married twice and had three children. Awarded a CBE in 1981 for his services to acting, Hardy was also a keen student of military history and supported the project to raise the Mary Rose.  In 1995, he gave up his long-time home in Oxfordshire, to become laird of a Scottish mansion, a 13th Century miniature castle situated near Edinburgh, complete with a walled garden and 50-foot tower.  The actor had visited the place as a child and sworn always to return, following in the footsteps of a previous visitor, Sir Walter Scott, one of Hardy's personal heroes.   In later years he suffered from cancer of the colon, but recovered to resume as busy a career as ever, including film work.  Although he failed to make the lasting impact on Hollywood enjoyed by some British actors, his face became known the world over when he appeared as the Minister of Magic, Cornelius Fudge, in several of the Harry Potter films.  He was dropped from the role after the studio balked at paying a £1 million life insurance premium which was demanded because of his advancing age. Off screen he became something of an authority on the English longbow, his interest having been stimulated when, as a child, he found two of the weapons in the family attic .  He wrote two books on the history of the weapon as well as presenting a BBC documentary on the subject.  Hardy's on-screen temper was matched by a famously short fuse away from the camera and he admitted that, as an actor, he belonged to a set of ""difficult people"". He once reflected: ""The ego may be essential for survival in the wilderness of acting, but it's something that requires a great deal of control if you're going to make a success of life.""

Volatility,G20 fail to agree economy targets,2024-09-25,2011-02-17,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-12499214,"The role of the yuan, and China's accumulation of US dollars, lies at the heart of the impasse Negotiators have failed to agree targets to reduce global economic imbalances on the first day of the two-day G20 meeting in Paris. The countries want to better coordinate economic policies to avoid a repeat of the 2008 global financial crisis. Most back a list of five targets, but China is said to oppose exchange rate and currency reserve criteria. Beijing has been accused of buying up dollars in order to keep the yuan cheap and gain an unfair trade advantage. Some economists say that China and other ""mercantilist"" countries contributed to the 2008 financial crisis by accumulating excessive foreign currency reserves, especially US dollars. By buying up dollars, these countries hold down the value of their own currencies, making them more competitive and helping them to run surpluses. And by investing this money in US government debt, they are accused of having helped to make borrowing costs in the US too cheap during the last decade, helping to fuel the housing bubble. ""We think it is not appropriate to use real effective exchange rates and reserves,"" said Chinese finance minister Xie Xuren, speaking to his counterparts from Brazil, Russia and China. ""Emerging markets, to deal with financial crises and economic shocks, need to set up a certain amount of reserves,"" he said. Many Asian countries began building up their reserves in the wake of a crisis in 1997 that saw many of them forced to painfully devalue their currency. Finance ministers will meet on Saturday to try to hammer out a compromise. One idea being floated is that China could focus on its trade surplus instead of its current account surplus. This would mean the country could ignore the effect of all the income it earns from the multi-trillion dollars-worth of US government bonds and other foreign financial assets it owns. However, Germany and Canada are opposed to this idea. Meanwhile, the Canadian and Brazilian governments have backed the idea of including the yuan in the IMF's ""special drawing rights"" (SDRs), as a step towards making the Chinese currency into a reserve currency. What to do about the rising price of basic goods like food is likely to preoccupy the G20 meeting Most countries agree that central banks have become too reliant on buying up just dollars, and many favour a bigger role for SDRs, which comprise a broader bundle of major currencies. However, Beijing does not allow foreigners to freely buy yuan in the currency markets. And China's trade surpluses mean that other countries find it impossible to accumulate the currency in return for the exports they sell to China. Meanwhile, the G20 is being urged to tackle the issue of price inflation affecting basic goods. Ahead of the meeting, the International Monetary Fund warned food price rises have increased economic imbalances. And earlier this week, the World Bank said food prices were at ""dangerous levels"", saying that forty-four million people have been pushed into poverty since last June. John Lipsky, first deputy managing director of the IMF, told the BBC that the G20 needed to work to remedy the instability: ""There is great concern over the obvious high volatility of basic commodity prices especially food."" This video can not be played G20 meeting urged to curb prices French President Nicolas Sarkozy, who is currently the head of the G20, has argued that commodity speculators should be reined in in order to reduce food price spikes and volatility.  Meanwhile, more than 100 European and international organisations led by  the World Development Movement (WDM) have signed a statement warning the G20 of what they see as the dangers of unchecked speculation. Julian Oram of the WDM said: ""By taking action now to curb excessive speculation on food, G20 leaders could save lives, reduce chronic hunger and prevent civil and political unrest."" Some analysts have pointed to the difference between speculation, which can provide up-front money to a farmer to plant new crops, for example, and market manipulation, which is designed purely as a play on prices. Mr Lipsky said the market for food and other basic commodities was heavily burdened by controls and subsidies: ""I think it would be very useful for the G20 to look at these markets in much better detail and see if they can be improved to better serve the global community and not be a source of instability and worry.""

Volatility,Why Nigeria is a global leader in Bitcoin trade,2024-09-25,2021-02-28,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-56169917,"More cryptocurrency trading goes on in Nigeria than almost anywhere else in the world, reflecting a loss of faith in more traditional forms of investment, as Ijeoma Ndukwe reports. Tola Fadugbagbe recalls moving to Lagos from his small south-western town 10 years ago with dreams of brighter prospects.  Instead, the 34-year-old ended up in a series of odd jobs earning the minimum wage to survive - a typical story for many young Nigerians who are just trying to get by. It was not until 2016 that online adverts for Bitcoin piqued his interest and he began his cryptocurrency journey. ""I started intensive research,"" Mr Fadugbagbe told the BBC.  ""I was spending hours every day watching videos on YouTube and reading articles about Bitcoin. I didn't have much money so I started with $100 to $200.""  It was a decision that transformed his life.  At the time that we spoke, Mr Fadugbagbe, who now trades full time and teaches budding investors, said he had cryptocurrency worth more than $200,000 (£140,000) in his possession.  ""I'll soon be moving into my own house, which I'm building. I have a farm - a very big one - courtesy of cryptocurrency,"" he laughs gleefully, unencumbered by concerns that he could be inflating an investment bubble that will one day burst. ""No Nigerian comes to cryptocurrency and wants to look back. It's a big opportunity."" Success stories like Mr Fadugbagbe's have attracted millions of Nigerians to digital currencies such as Bitcoin.  A 2020 online survey by data platform Statista found that 32% of those Nigerians who took part used cryptocurrencies - the highest proportion of any country in the world.  Estimates show that of the top 10 countries for trading volumes, Nigeria ranked third place after the US and Russia in 2020, generating more than $400m worth of transactions. Although Nigeria has eased out of its second recession in less than five years, the challenging economic climate remains, making alternative sources of income and alternative currencies attractive. The Central Bank of Nigeria devalued the currency, the naira, by 24% last year. There are fears of a further fall in value by as much as 10% this year. Meanwhile prices continue to rise, with food inflation climbing to its highest point since July 2008. When Michael Ugwu, the founder of a media company in Lagos, sold land he owned in 2018, he realised he needed to explore new investment opportunities. Although his naira earnings had gone up, he was worse of in US dollar terms because of the devaluation. ""I'd made naira but lost US dollars. That's when I realised we're hustling backwards. It was then that I started to look into Bitcoin.""  The move to invest in digital currencies has paid off.  ""On some of my currencies I've made 50 times what I invested. On Bitcoin it's easily grown 10 times in the last year,"" he says. The former banker sees cryptocurrency as an evolution of finance, describing it as ""finance 2.0"".  Despite the currency's volatility, Mr Ugwu sees it as a valuable tool to ""hedge"" or reduce the risk of living in what he describes as a high-risk environment.  His wife Onyeka started to invest when faced with high commission charges to transfer cash between her Nigerian and British accounts. ""For me it's a banking system,"" she says.  ""It wasn't about making money. It was about how [to] have a better banking experience. Look at it as saving your money in a currency that can keep the value of the money."" Despite its appeal, economists around the world warn that Bitcoin, and other cryptocurrencies, are high-risk investments.  There are legitimate concerns that Bitcoin's soaring value is a speculative bet that will one day leave many in ruins. An international banker based in Nigeria, who asked to remain anonymous, says it is a financial product that carries significant potential regulatory risk.  He says that ""governments and central banks have not decided whether they can, or should, regulate it"". ""On a technical level I'm not 100% sure that the security that it uses is entirely foolproof. I think there are still some technical uncertainties,"" he adds. In an effort to regulate the market, Nigeria's central bank banned banks from facilitating cryptocurrency-related transactions in 2017, but the ban remained largely unenforced.  However, this year the institution doubled down on its stance.  In a statement released on 7 February it cited the need to protect the general public and safeguard the country from potential threats posed by ""unknown and unregulated entities"" that are ""well-suited for conducting many illegal activities"". Since then, many Nigerians have reported that their bank accounts have been frozen due to cryptocurrency-related activity.  Mr Fadugbagbe's bank manager called to advise him that his account would be closed, giving him a day to transfer his funds.  However, not everyone has been so fortunate.  One source says his bank account was frozen two weeks ago with tens of thousands of naira in it.  The software engineer says the bank would not disclose the reason for its actions.  He suspects he was targeted for running a cryptocurrency remittance business.  Furthermore, the BBC was shown a customer's bank correspondence, which contains the warning: ""We strongly advise that you do not use your account for cryptocurrency-related activities so you don't get into trouble with the law"".  However many investors with the possibility say they will continue to trade using their overseas bank accounts.  They say they can easily revert to peer-to-peer transactions. This means that rather than transferring funds between a financial institution and a cryptocurrency online trading platform, investors transfer funds directly to each other or through a middle person as they buy and sell.  This is the method the cryptocurrency community used before the development of the virtual currency marketplace ecosystem in Nigeria. Mr Ugwu has also heard many in the business of cryptocurrency talk of relocating to potentially more hospitable environments such as Ghana, Rwanda and Sierra Leone. The concerns of the authorities when it comes to cryptocurrencies being used for illegal purposes are legitimate but some argue that they are being too heavy handed. A former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank, Kingsley Moghalu, believes that the country should engage and manage the risks ""rather than just shutting it off completely - especially to the extent that it provides livelihoods for many people in a depressed economy"".  There are also fears that cryptocurrency could become a missed opportunity, according to Gbite Oduneye who heads EGM Group, a Lagos-based brokerage firm.  ""Nigeria is the third largest place for cryptocurrency trade in terms of volume,"" he explains. ""If you don't take advantage, someone else will. Build an ecosystem round it. Put in rules and regulations."" Nigerians also see cryptocurrencies as a way to get around foreign currency restrictions. ""There are a lot of restrictions on what we can and cannot do with our foreign exchange,"" Nena Nwachukwu from popular trading platform Paxful explains.  ""Nigerians find it easier to use [cryptocurrency] as an investment tool."" She saw awareness of their service grow in October 2020 during the #EndSars protests against police brutality.  Attempts to crack down on the organisers by freezing their bank accounts led to the increased use of digital currencies, which saw Bitcoin trend on Twitter.  Ms Nwachukwu says this resulted in a wave of new sign ups and an increase in transactions.  At the heart of the rise of Bitcoin is a distrust of centralised financial systems and top-down economic control, investors say.  Many express their frustrations with government policy and the decline of the Nigerian economy.  None more so than Mr Fadugbagbe, who spent years struggling to scrape by as what he describes as a ""minimum-wage slave"".  ""I don't do shares and government bonds"", he says. ""Those are scams. I trust cryptocurrency more."" Clarification 1 March 2021: This article has been amended to make it clear that the Statista survey of Nigerians was carried out online, and so does not reflect the whole population."
Volatility,Bernanke signals economic action,2024-09-25,2010-10-15,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-11551993,"This video can not be played Ben Bernanke says there is a ""case for further action"" US Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke has opened the way to a new round of quantitative easing. ""There would appear, all else being equal, to be a case for further action,"" he said, in a speech to the Boston regional federal reserve. The US central bank is expected to back a move to buy up US government bonds in order to lower borrowing costs at its next meeting on 3 November. Mr Bernanke said unemployment and low inflation lay behind his view. However, some colleagues at the Fed have expressed much more hawkish views, and Mr Bernanke was careful not to pre-empt the decision of the rate-setting committee due next month. In his speech, external, he did not give any indication of the size or timing of any new quantitative easing, but did confirm it was likely to target US government bonds. Previously the Fed has bought up billions of dollars of US mortgage debts. Mr Bernanke warned that prolonged high employment would put recovery at risk, while the inflation rate has been trending downwards. The Fed has a dual mandate to maintain price stability and full employment. He played down a view expressed by some of his colleagues that high unemployment was ""structural"" in nature - for example because US workers do not have relevant skills for available jobs - and therefore something the Fed could not help. Instead he blamed the continuing high level of joblessness on the sharp contraction in demand in the economy - something that further monetary easing should ameliorate. He also raised concern that the inflation rate was falling below what he considered consistent with the Fed's mandate. He said some measures suggested the underlying inflation rate - which ignores short-term price volatility - may have fallen as low as 0.5% in recent months. Most analysts believe the Fed targets a rate of 2%. The speech contained no major surprises for markets, as it largely repeated views expressed in the minutes from the Fed's latest policy meeting. The dollar dropped about 0.3% against most major currencies following the speech's release, before bouncing back strongly when stronger-than-expected retail sales were announced 15 minutes later. Against the yen, it briefly hit a new 15-year low of 80.89, only 1.5% above its all-time low of 79.7 yen. Quantitative easing is partly aimed at weakening the dollar's value, by increasing the amount of dollar cash in circulation. A weaker dollar helps the Fed achieve its dual mandate, by making US exporters more competitive - stimulating job creation - and by increasing inflation through higher import prices. The dollar has lost 15% of its value against the euro since early June, on growing speculation that a slowdown in the US economy in the second half of the year would force the Fed to ease monetary conditions further.

Volatility,Shares of India's 'family silverware' go on sale,2024-09-25,2022-05-04,By Nikhil Inamdar,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-61296184,"Shares in the Indian state-run insurance giant Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) went on sale this week in a $2.75bn (£2.18bn) initial public offering, witnessing strong demand from investors. The government is offering a 3.5% stake in what will be India's largest share sale, despite both the size and valuation of the issue being slashed significantly to reflect current market conditions. The issue was fully subscribed on Thursday, a day after it opened for sale to retail investors, employees and policy holders. The date for share listing is 17 May, the government's Department of Investment and Public Asset Management said. Bids for anchor investors opened on 2 May but share sale for the public opened on 4 May and would close on 9 May. General investors can buy equity shares at a price band set at $11.75-12.36 (£9.38-9.87) per share. The company's policyholders, employees as well as small mom and pop investors will be entitled to an additional discount of up to 60 rupees, according to papers filed by the company with India's securities watchdog.Broking firm Zerodha expects at least 8-12 million additional online trading accounts to be opened by investors keen to apply for the IPO, a 10-15% bump up from the 80 million accounts currently in operation. LIC is nearly as old as independent India. Formed by nationalising and merging 245 private insurance companies, it started issuing policies in 1956, holding a monopoly on India's insurance sector until the turn of the millennium.   More than two decades after private competition was allowed, LIC continues to hold a leadership position, with 66% market share as of 2021.   Its sheer size makes the insurance behemoth a systemically important company for India.    At over $500bn, its asset base is bigger than the GDP of several countries. And with nearly 280 million policies in force, it manages four times more policies than the entire population of the UK.   It is also India's largest asset manager, with massive investments in state and central securities as well as the stock market.   According to the ratings agency CRISIL, LIC's equity investments in listed companies represented 4% of the total market capitalisation of the National Stock Exchange. It has also been the default financier of the government in trying times, bailing out flailing state-run companies.   LIC also owns a sprawling portfolio of real estate across India.   With 1.3 million distributors selling policies across pretty much every nook and corner in India, the ubiquitous ""LIC agent"" has held a unique place in independent India's public consciousness.   Srinivasalu Naidu, a septuagenarian who has sold policies door to door for the past 30 years, told the BBC he was known in his heyday as ""LIC Naidu"", a much revered figure in his village in the southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh.    Agents like him have been critical to the company's growth and mission to build trust and create a savings culture across the remote corners of the country.   ""People didn't buy policies from me just as insurance, they did it as an investment. For their kids' education or wedding. They trusted their life savings with me,"" said Naidu.   Private banking giant UBS estimates 10 out of every 100 rupees saved by Indian households go into LIC, a much larger amount than even the deposits attracted by India's largest bank, the State Bank of India.   Given LIC's social relevance and scaled-down valuation, India's opposition politicians have accused the government of selling ""family silverware"" and prioritising shareholders over politicians.  According to analysts, even at the upper price band, LIC's issue has been valued far lower by the government than its three listed private peers - HDFC Life Insurance Co., SBI Life Insurance Co. and ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Co.   ""It is not justified at all. You should also involve the opposition (in deliberations), when you are disinvesting something like the LIC which is a social security net,"" Dr Shama Mohamed, a spokesperson of the Congress party, told the BBC.   Last month, PM Narendra Modi's government decided to defer the mega IPO amid global stock market volatility due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. It had initially planned to raise about $8b by selling 5% of LIC to fund its widening fiscal deficit - the gap between earnings and expenditure.   Amid surging fuel costs and lower growth projections, the pruned fundraising target is expected to put additional pressure on New Delhi's already stretched finances.  But analysts say the size and price are appropriate given the current environment, with foreign investors pulling out nearly $20bn from Indian equities since October 2021. And the government is confident that LIC's dominant leadership position and fair valuation will attract significant investor interest.    ""Even if we have a bit of a constrained environment, we can still pull it off because that's the kind of optimum demand scenario which exists,"" Tuhin Kanta Pandey, secretary at the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management, told journalists in Mumbai last week.   In the long run, a stock market listing is expected to improve how the firm is run and bring in more transparency.  But at a time when its competitors have all gone digital, LIC's overt dependence on physical distributors has been flagged as a cause of concern by analysts, who believe it will continue losing market share in the years ahead.   ""On the margin front, it will be kind of hard for LIC to compete if it sticks to the distributor model. They will have to re-innovate the company and become relevant for what the insurance market will be tomorrow,"" says Nikhil Kamath, co-founder of Zerodha.   According to economic commentator Vivek Kaul, LIC pays agents twice as much in commissions in the first year, compared to private insurers, which is not sustainable in the longer run.   Covid-19 has also had an impact on the company. Its growth in new business premiums declined significantly as lockdowns disrupted operations, reiterating the need for LIC to significantly leverage technology to drive operating efficiency.   But analysts expect India's young population and massive under-penetration of life insurance to give LIC a long runway for expansion.   According to analysis from the broking firm Anand Rathi, India's protection gap - or the difference between the insurance required and actually available - was 83% or US$16.5 trillion in 2019, the highest in Asia-Pacific, ""thereby presenting a huge potential for growth""."
Volatility,June poll was 'hold your nose election',2024-09-25,2017-08-21,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-40998017,"Tactical voting reached a new peak at June's general election as voters tried to get round a failed system, according to electoral reform campaigners. The Electoral Reform Society branded the poll a ""hold your nose election,"" claiming 6.5 million voted tactically rather than for what they believed in. The Conservatives would have won a majority if just 0.0016% of voters had chosen differently, it found. The ERS campaigns for the introduction of proportional representation. Elections for the Westminster Parliament use the ""first-past-the-post"" system - under which the party that gains the most MPs, rather than the most votes overall, wins. June's general election, in which Conservative leader Theresa May lost her Commons majority, saw an apparent return to two-party politics as more than 80% of voters cast a ballot for either the Conservatives or Labour. But a BMG survey of just over 2,000 voters, shortly before polling day, suggested ""voters did not flock back to the two largest parties with enthusiasm,"" according to an ERS analysis. Some 20% of those surveyed said they they would be choosing the candidate that was most likely to beat the one they disliked, it suggested. ""This is over double the proportion who said they would do so in 2015,"" said the ERS report.  ""Projecting this onto actual turnout would equate to nearly 6,500,000 people voting tactically,"" it explained. The ERS claims the ""first-past-the post"" system exaggerated political divisions because of the huge discrepancy in the number of votes cast in an area for a party and the number of seats it won. For instance, Labour won 29% of votes cast in the South East of England but got just 10% of seats, while Conservatives won 34% of the North East but returned just 9% of seats, according to the research. ""For the third time in a row, Westminster's voting system has failed to do what it says on the tin - produce a strong and stable government,"" said the ERS chief executive, Darren Hughes.  ""June's election has shown first-past-the-post is unable to cope with people's changing voting habits - forcing citizens and parties to try and game the system. ""This surge in tactical voting - double the rate of 2015 - meant voters shifted their party allegiances at unprecedented rates, with the second highest level of voter volatility since the inter-war years,"" Mr Hughes added. Mr Hughes said a system ""designed for two parties"" was not up to the job of accommodating the ""complex electoral swings"" seen in modern elections. ""The vast majority of votes are going to waste, with millions still stuck in the electoral black hole of winner-takes-all."" The ERS repeated its call for a new system to be introduced to stop votes being wasted or voters being forced into tactical decisions. A spokeswoman for the Cabinet Office, which sets electoral rules, said: ""First past the post is a voting system that offers a robust method of electing MPs. ""A referendum on changing the voting system for general elections was held in 2011 and the public voted overwhelmingly in favour of keeping the first past the post system,"" she added. If the referendum had gone the other way, and the Alternative Vote method had been introduced, Labour would have been chief beneficiaries in 2017, gaining 24 seats, while in 2015 the Conservatives would have doubled their majority from 12 to 24, according to research by YouGov, which asked more than 13,000 people how they would have voted under different electoral systems."
Volatility,What is the US Federal Reserve doing?,2024-09-25,2017-09-20,By Andrew Walker,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-41320675,"The US Federal Reserve has decided to start running down the stock of financial assets it bought in its quantitative easing scheme. Quantitative easing was a policy that the Fed, and other central banks, used to prevent the recession that followed the financial crisis from becoming an even deeper downturn.  It involved buying financial assets with money newly created by the central bank. In the US the assets were bonds or debts issued by the Federal government and by official agencies that support lending to home buyers. One aim of the policy was to reduce the interest rates paid by businesses and households borrowing money.  Normally central banks try to do that by using their own interest rate policies, which in the case of the Fed means a target it sets for overnight borrowing between commercial banks, known as the Federal Funds Rate. But when that official rate got to almost zero, as it did in December 2008, the Fed's policy makers thought that it couldn't, or shouldn't go any lower.  The Fed's own research suggests that its QE policy has helped reduce long term interest rates. The consequence of all that QE is that the Fed now holds about four and a half trillion dollars of assets. Before it started the programme the figure was less than a quarter of that amount.  Assessments of the impact of QE vary, but many economists take the view that it has helped the US economy.  Many also fear it has created a new danger of financial market instability.  Share and bond prices are high. Some argue that there is a bubble that could burst and trigger a new financial crisis.  The Fed's asset purchases mean there has been more demand for the assets it is buying which tends to push the prices up. In addition, the sellers of those assets need to do something with the money they receive. They may repay debt, but in many cases they buy other assets, often assets with more risk of losing money - such as shares or assets in emerging economies. That in turn tends to push their prices up.  That is what lies behind the concerns about possible financial instability.  All the major developed world central banks, apart from Canada's, have used quantitative easing and several are still actively buying financial assets. In the US however, the Fed stopped in 2014.  But that doesn't mean that it stopped buying assets at the time.   Bonds are debts which (mostly) have a repayment or maturity date when the holder receives the face value of the bond from the borrower or issuer of the bond.  The debt is in effect repaid to whoever owns the bond on the date it matures. In the case of US government bond, it's the Treasury that would repay the central bank.  So far, the Fed has used the proceeds of these repayments to buy more bonds in the financial markets keeping its holdings roughly constant.  Now it is going to reduce the amount that it 'reinvests' in that way. So over time, as more bonds mature its holdings of them will decline.  It also means that over time the extra money it created in the first place to buy the bonds will decline.  As an aside it's worth emphasising that the newly created money is not something that can be spent on goods and services. It is money called reserves, which is held in accounts owned by commercial banks at the central bank.  It's used for transactions between banks and is an important part of the financial and monetary system. But other types of business and households can't use this type of money. Having said that, adding to the total amount of reserves can lead to an increase in money held by the public but it is an indirect effect.  Running down the Fed's holdings of assets will also mean that the amount of reserves held by the banks will decline too.  As with interest rate increases the Fed's approach is cautious. There is no hurry to get things back to what might be considered normal. The decline in its bond holdings in the first month will be no more than ten billion dollars, rising gradually over the course of the following year.  We haven't been told what the ultimate level will be. But the Fed has said that the amount of reserves held by the banks when this process is complete is likely to be higher than before the crisis. All the time there is a degree of wariness among central bankers in the US and other developed economies that they could set back the recovery if they were to raise interest rates or change their QE policies too quickly.  There was a warning in 2013 with an episode that came to be known as the ""taper tantrum"". That was a time when the Fed's QE bond purchases were in full swing. The then Chair of the Fed, Ben Bernanke suggested that it might start to slow down the purchases - or taper its QE. That led to significant volatility in financial markets.  It most likely didn't too much lasting economic damage, but it has probably reinforced the cautious instincts of the current Fed Chair Janet Yellen. She certainly doesn't want to see another tantrum. She has said she wants the Fed's unwinding of its QE to be like ""watching paint dry"". "
Volatility,University admissions could see emergency controls,2024-09-25,2020-03-29,By Sean Coughlan,https://www.bbc.com/news/education-52086932,"Universities in England could face fixed limits on how many students they each recruit, in a bid to create more stability and reduce financial threats. There are concerns that the uncertainty caused by the coronavirus could leave some universities with too few applicants to stay financially viable. It is understood that emergency controls are being considered to stop a free-for-all in student recruitment. But Universities UK said any ""stability measures"" had not yet been decided. ""Financial support from government for universities is necessary,"" said the university group's chief executive Alistair Jarvis. But he said any response such as controls on student numbers would need ""more detailed consideration"" and so far had not been approved by Universities UK. ""There would need to be a clear case of the benefits, any proposal would have to be sector-led not imposed, strictly time-limited and carefully crafted to avoid unintended consequences,"" he said. A government source described the idea as ""speculation"". But the vice chancellor of Sheffield Hallam University, Sir Chris Husbands, said student number controls were necessary during the current crisis ""to ensure that institutions have a viable first-year-student population"". Sir Chris, in a paper for the Higher Education Policy Institute, says ""radical action is needed on university admissions for the foreseeable future. This means suspending the market in admissions"". The aim would be to encourage more stability in an admissions round caught up in the coronavirus outbreak, which has closed schools and universities and cancelled exams. More students than usual might defer entry and take a gap year - with universities uncertain about whether they will be able to re-open campuses for the autumn. Universities are also expecting a fall in overseas student numbers - making funding from home students even more important. Last week the higher education watchdog intervened to stop universities making unconditional offers, after fears that some were recruiting large numbers of students by promising places regardless of their grades. With A-level exams scrapped and grades set to be based on teachers' assessments, the Office for Students and the universities minister Michelle Donelan were concerned that anxious students might switch to the promise of an unconditional offer. But there were also concerns that the volatility around this year's applications could leave some universities with such a shortage of students that it would threaten their financial stability. Universities are understood to remain divided over a response. Introducing student number controls would mean individual universities would not be allowed to expand. This would ensure that the share of students between universities stayed similar to the current levels, providing them with more security over tuition fee income. But student number controls would also mean a limit on student choice - so that popular universities would not be able to add extra places. It will also raise questions about what will happen if universities have offered more places than they will be allowed to provide. Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute, said: ""The crisis is fast becoming the catalyst for the return of student number caps."" He warned that it might bring short-term stability, but at the expense of stopping the expansion of university places and limiting the choices of individual students. A Department for Education spokeswoman said the department would ""continue working closely with the sector to manage the impact of coronavirus""."
Volatility,Half a million face electricity bill hike,2024-09-25,2017-08-17,By Clodagh Rice,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-40954433,"Almost 500,000 households across Northern Ireland are going to see a rise in their electricity bills.  In its first price-hike for four years, Power NI is increasing residential prices by 5.6%, which will make the average annual household bill £27 more expensive from October. Some 34,000 farms and businesses will also see their prices rise by about 6%. One reason is because it costs more to generate electricity, as a result of increasing gas and coal prices. Exchange rates are also making this more expensive as coal is traded in dollars and the pound has weakened significantly against the dollar since the UK voted to leave the EU in June. Until now, customers have not been exposed to this volatility, as Power NI hedges its electricity prices up to a year in advance. Stephen McCully, managing director of Power NI, said: ""So much is dependent upon world fuel costs, which are outside our control and which have an effect on the price we pay for wholesale electricity. ""We have not increased our prices since 2013, so it is particularly disappointing for us that we have to do so now."" Since its last tariff, gas prices have risen about 10% and rising inflation has pushed up network costs.   The Federation of Small Businesses said the price hike - which amounts to twice the rate of inflation - was ""disappointing and unwelcome"". ""It adds a further adverse burden to what are already some of the highest operating costs faced by SMEs, at a time of increasing uncertainty,"" said FSB NI's policy chairman Wilfred Mitchell. ""Rising costs are already having to be absorbed by business owners, making it increasingly difficult for them to invest, expand and create jobs; this price hike will undoubtedly have a negative impact on economic growth."" Jenny Pyper, Utility Regulator chief executive, said: ""Agreeing an increase to Power NI's domestic electricity tariff is not a decision that we take lightly."" ""We carry out extensive scrutiny of Power NI's costs to ensure that any change to their tariff is justified."" ""Domestic electricity prices in Northern Ireland have not increased in four years, but unfortunately, due to rises in wholesale energy costs, this increase is unavoidable,"" she added. "
Volatility,Isle of Man electricity prices set to rise,2024-09-25,2023-03-06,By Ashlea Tracey,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-isle-of-man-64836764,"Electricity bills on the Isle of Man are set to rise by 51% on average, Manx Utilities (MU) has announced. The increase will by applied in two stages, in April and in July, following a six-month price freeze. It means an average customer's annual bill could go up by more than £380. MU chairman, Tim Johnston MHK, said the firm could no longer shield customers from price hikes due to volatility in the wholesale gas market. ""We are very conscious of the impact that this will have on our customers and the decision... is not one the Manx Utilities board has made lightly,"" he added. MU said it had been absorbing price changes by using £25m of reserves and saving £40m by forward purchasing gas, which is used to produce most of the island's electricity. But the state-owned energy provider said it was no longer sustainable to do so with a deficit of about £50m anticipated for the next financial year. The increase will mean that a customer who lives in an two or three bedroom house, and does not use electricity to heat their home, will see their annual bill rise by more than £380. The energy provider explained this type of household could expect an increase from £751 to £942 from April, and then to £1,133 from July.  Politicians backed plans to freeze tariffs for the winter months in September and provide a £26m loan to MU, to be taken from treasury reserves. Mr Johnston said MU had not used the loan as temporarily reducing tariffs would mean higher tariffs in the future, and a higher overall cost for customers. ""The aim has been to minimise the cost to our customers whilst ensuring Manx Utilities can continue to meet its financial obligations,"" he added.

Volatility,Finance minister calls for cost of living support,2024-09-25,2022-07-18,By Jayne McCormack,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-62196202,"Stormont's finance minister has written a joint letter with his counterparts in Scotland and Wales, asking the chancellor for extra support to tackle rising costs. Conor Murphy had previously urged the Treasury to make ""targeted interventions"" to address the cost of living crisis. The devolved ministers are now asking for an increase to their budgets. They said it would deal with ""significant emerging pressures"".  That includes increasing pressures on the regions' health services.  The letter was sent to Nadhim Zahawi, who took over as Chancellor a fortnight ago, after Rishi Sunak resigned in protest at Boris Johnson's leadership. The letter stated that the cost of living crisis is ""not evenly distributed"", and therefore interventions to tackle it should be targeted at those most vulnerable. ""Many of the levers which can make the biggest difference sit with the UK government,"" it continued. ""We thought it was an opportunity, even though there's a new chancellor, and perhaps there's no certainty on how long they'll be in post but we did want to register our collective concerns and make sure they were in the system as soon as we could,"" Mr Murphy told BBC News NI. ""It's important when the three finance ministers from each of the devolved areas agree on these matters that we communicate jointly to the Treasury to try and maximise the impact of those requests,"" he added. ""We know that the crisis will deepen very much in the autumn. ""They have told us they make take some further steps in relation to the cost of living in the autumn statement but that could be in late November. ""We're asking them to consider what action can be taken now over the course of the summer and be ready to assist people who are under a great degree of pressure,"" the minister added. Every household in the UK is due to get a £400 energy discount this autumn to help with bills. However, it is still unclear how that payment will be made in Northern Ireland. The UK Treasury previously said the lack of a functioning executive at Stormont means that it may not make the payment through the normal Barnett Consequential to Northern Ireland, as it had previously done with a £200 energy loan payment scheme. This is a mechanism for how funding is divided among the devolved regions. Mr Murphy and his officials have been holding discussions with the Treasury about how the discount can be applied in Northern Ireland. The joint letter also called for ""fairness"" when it comes to public sector pay rises. ""We need a fair and appropriate response on public sector pay and urge you to give firmer assurances on sensible pay uplifts for our public sector workers,"" it outlined. It stated that due to ""inflationary pressures"", there is a need for the government in Westminster to uplift devolved budgets in line with pressures on the health service and education sector. Experts have forecast that energy prices will rise further this autumn due to volatility in global markets. A Treasury spokesperson said the government understands that people are struggling with rising prices and it has ""acted to protect the 8 million most vulnerable British families"". This has been done ""through at least £1,200 of direct payments this year with additional support for pensioners and those claiming disability benefits"", a statement added. ""Through our £37 billion support package we are also saving the typical employee over £330 a year through this month's national insurance cut, allowing people on universal credit to keep £1,000 more of what they earn and cutting fuel duty by 5p - the biggest ever cut to fuel duty rates which saves a typical family £100."""
Volatility,Scots insolvencies up 46% in six months,2024-09-25,2019-08-04,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-49229153,"The number of companies in Scotland declared insolvent has risen by 46% in six months, according to new analysis. KPMG said economic volatility is behind the trend, with Brexit creating uncertainty for businesses. The professional services firm advised businesses to plan for worst-case scenarios and be fiscally cautious. It said there were 698 corporate insolvency appointments between January and June, up from 479 in the previous six months. Of the 698 cases, the vast majority (661) involved a company liquidation, while 37 were administration and receivership appointments. The number of insolvencies in the quarter ending 30 June is similar to that of the same period the previous year. Blair Nimmo, KPMG head of restructuring, said: ""While there is clearly a trend towards an increase in corporate insolvencies, there are some signs of resilience. ""The last quarter has remained far more static and a number of industries are taking proactive measures to put themselves on a more stable financial footing, including retailers, hoping corporate voluntary arrangement proposals could head off the prospect of administration. ""The ongoing Brexit discussions and change of Prime Minister and Cabinet have undoubtedly create a climate of uncertainty but there are wider challenges at play, creating a toxic mix of issues for businesses going through a period of distress."" He added: ""The best approach for any business in Scotland right now is to maintain a fiscally cautious approach, ensuring you maximise reserves, proactively and regularly review contingency plans and - ultimately - plan for any worst case scenarios. ""A number of challenges could be on the horizon, but with a resilient, focused approach, including taking appropriate advice at an early stage, Scotland's business community can continue to grow sustainably in the long-term."""
Volatility,Trump calls for end to quarterly reporting,2024-09-25,2018-08-17,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45226228,"Donald Trump has called for US companies to issue financial reports just twice a year rather than four times. The US President said he has asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to consider altering rules requiring firms to report every quarter. The move would improve ""flexibility and save money"", Mr Trump said. Some analysts have criticised the idea, which they say would ""keep investors in the dark for longer"". Mr Trump tweeted: ""In speaking with some of the world's top business leaders I asked what it is that would make business (jobs) even better in the US. 'Stop quarterly reporting & go to a six month system,' said one"", he tweeted. President Trump said he had ""asked the SEC to study"" such a move. Analysts said the idea of having companies report less frequently was not new, with some suggesting it could make markets less transparent and more volatile when financial data is released after such a long period. ""If you reduce transparency, including the frequency of reporting, it is thus likely to increase uncertainty, which is the enemy of investors,"" said Robert Phipps, a director at Per Sterling Capital Management. Stan Shipley at Evercore ISI said: ""[If] you give investors less information on what's going on, there's a risk of injecting volatility in your stock price because investors are not guided the right way.  ""You're more likely to surprise investors when you're reporting just twice a year instead of quarterly.""  However, other analysts said reducing the frequency of financial reporting to twice a year could potentially reduce ""short-termism"" in listed companies' strategies. ""The difficulty in making better long-term decisions away from a quarterly reporting cycle certainly stands out as being beneficial,"" said Art Hogan at investment bank B. Riley FBR. Randy Frederick at Charles Schwab argued that such a major change for both companies and traders would be ""like trying to turn around the Queen Mary in a swimming pool"". ""This is not something he can change with an executive order,"" he added. The SEC requires listed US companies to issue quarterly and annual financial reports to keep investors informed about their financial position.  The Trump administration wants to cut red tape that it says is responsible for a 50% drop in companies coming to market over the past two decades, including relaxing some of the disclosure and compliance requirements for listed companies and those looking to go public.  In a report published by the US Treasury last year, the administration outlined policies it hoped would revitalise listings - but did not go as far as suggesting quarterly reporting requirements be scrapped. The SEC was not immediately available for comment."
Volatility,Building material costs affect public projects,2024-09-25,2021-08-03,By John Campbell,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-58070738,"Northern Ireland construction companies facing big rises in the cost of building materials could be allowed to increase the prices of previously agreed public sector contracts. Building firms are dealing with surging global prices for products like timber. The Stormont Executive has agreed guidance for government departments dealing with contractors. It includes the possibility of agreeing cost increases or later completion dates.  Finance Minister Conor Murphy said the impact of the pandemic on supply chains has ""had a huge impact on the availability of construction materials with global demand, product shortages and delivery delays leading to market volatility and increased prices"". ""Government contractors are experiencing escalating costs and delays in getting materials which they could not have foreseen when they tendered for government work."" The executive has agreed a ""procurement advisory note"".  It says that where a contractor can ""provide compelling evidence on an open book basis"" that it has experienced a significant delay in the supply of a product that impacts on a completion date then the department and contractor should work together ""in a spirit of mutual trust and cooperation"" to identify alternative materials or agree a change to the completion date. On prices, it says it is reasonable to expect contractors to absorb price fluctuations ""within moderate tolerances"".  However it acknowledges that in the current environment contractors may be able to show they are facing cost increases that are higher than that ""which a diligent contractor could reasonably have anticipated"".  In that situation the department should consider adjusting the price of the job. The note emphasises that firms will have to provide ""full transparency"" on how they originally priced a job and how material costs have changed. Mr Murphy said: ""I am pleased the executive has agreed my proposals to make provision to manage delays in supplies and to include mechanisms in existing and new contracts to make allowances for inflationary prices."" The move has been welcomed by the construction industry which has been warning that some firms were facing difficulties in completing contracts at previously agreed prices. Mark Spence, managing director of the Construction Employers Federation, said: ""We welcome this vital lifeline for local contractors who for many months have been shouldering the escalating burden of unforeseen global price increases and material shortages whilst ensuring public works continue to be delivered."" The measures will be reviewed at the end of September."
Volatility,House of Fraser slumps to £44m loss,2024-09-25,2018-05-10,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44068513,"Department store group House of Fraser lost almost £44m in 2017 as sales fell.  The department store's potential new Chinese owner, C.Banner, said the loss of £43.9m reversed a pre-tax profit of £1.5m for the previous year, while sales fell 6.3% to £787.8m.  It blamed Brexit, terror attacks and online for damaging the performance of the group, which owns 59 UK stores.      The Chinese group has agreed to take a 51% stake in House of Fraser if the chain pushes through a turnaround plan.  The extent of the chain's financial problems were revealed in a document submitted by C.Banner to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, announcing its proposal to acquire the stake in House of Fraser.  It pointed out that the annual loss figure for the House of Fraser group included the start-up and operating costs of House of Fraser China, but excluded the licence fee payable from the Chinese business to House of Fraser UK for the use of the name in that market. Separate figures for the UK business have yet to be reported.  However, the document said: ""The Brexit referendum and the UK's resultant decision to leave the European Union and the terrorist attack in London, combined with a rapidly evolving retail market, produced a period of uncertainty and volatility that resulted in a difficult trading environment for the whole retail industry in the UK.""   However, C.Banner said House of Fraser would become ""more stable"" after completing its restructuring plan and ""take advantage of its well-known brand to capture growth potential"". Earlier this month, C.Banner said it would take a controlling stake in the retailer from another Chinese firm, Nanjing Cenbest, but only if House of Fraser agreed a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) with its creditors.  The chain expects to make a formal CVA proposal next month, with a full restructuring in place by early 2019. Store closures are planned and the chain wants to renegotiate rents on others.  A CVA is designed to help a struggling company to pay back a proportion of its debts over time. It involves a strict repayment scheme overseen by an insolvency practitioner and must be approved by at least three quarters of the firm's creditors. "
Volatility,SSE Airtricity natural gas prices to rise by 39%,2024-09-25,2022-03-04,By Clodagh Rice,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-60620138,"SSE Airtricity will increase its natural gas prices for households and businesses by 39% from April.  It will add about £244 onto the typical household bill, which the Consumer Council says is the biggest rise in gas prices in their network since May 2011. The move will affect about 186,000 gas customers throughout Northern Ireland. SSE Airtricity said the continued pressure on global energy markets has had a significant impact on energy suppliers' ability to keep prices down. Their tariffs are independently scrutinised and approved by the Utility Regulator in consultation with the Consumer Council and the Department for the Economy. Andrew Greer, SSE Airtricity general manager, said: ""We understand this news will be unwelcome, if not unexpected, to our customers, given the extensive media focus on wholesale markets over the last six months. ""The cost of purchasing natural gas on the wholesale market has reached record highs this winter and regrettably, a proportion of this must be reflected in our prices,"" he added. ""In March 2021 gas cost around 50 pence per therm, today that cost is around £2 per therm after hitting as high as £4.50 per therm late last year."" Raymond Gormley of the Consumer Council said the company had no option but to increase costs.   He also said the invasion of Ukraine will push costs up. ""Energy prices could be volatile for a number of weeks and will remain high for the foreseeable future,"" he added. ""This situation shows the importance of the Department for the Economy's energy strategy that aims to tackle affordability in the long term and move us away from our dependence on fossil fuels."" John French, chief executive of the Utility Regulator, said the conflict in Ukraine has significantly exacerbated the volatility and price movements within the market. ""The cost of wholesale gas has increased significantly over the last seven months largely due to Russia reducing the supply of natural gas into Europe,"" he said. ""However, today's announcement does not take into account the further upward wholesale price pressures we have seen since Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  ""Regrettably, it is highly likely that a further increase to tariffs will be needed at some point."""
Volatility,How shops are coping with a weaker pound,2024-09-25,2017-06-27,By Suzanne Bearne,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-40352908,"""I really shop when the pound falls in value,"" says American Jian DeLeon. The 31-year-old editorial director at online US fashion website Highsnobiety is unsurprisingly passionate about clothes. He says his favourite luxury brands are now substantially cheaper in London.  ""Like anything from Comme Des Garcons. I got a jacket last time I was there for 40% less than I would have paid here,"" he says.  Before June last year, when the UK voted to leave the EU, he rarely went shopping on his regular work trips to the UK.  ""The littlest things from a pint at the pub to a short Uber ride were murder on my bank account because of the exchange rate.""  Now that some brands are significantly cheaper, he spends about $350 (£274; 310 euros) each time he comes, but thinks the favourable exchange rate means he saves around $100. ""It's easier for me to splurge and sometimes I do it too much for my own good,"" he confesses. Mr DeLeon isn't the only one indulging.  Just over a year on from the EU referendum, the pound is still around 16% lower against the dollar. The weakness has lured over a flock of international tourists hungry for high-end brands at relatively bargain prices.  Payments firm WorldPay says non-UK consumers' card spending at department stores rose by a fifth in the first three months of the year, while spending on electrical goods rose 22.7%.  US shoppers like Mr DeLeon have been amongst the biggest spenders, splashing out an extra 21.5% on their cards during the same period, it said. ""The extreme currency fluctuations encourages shoppers to buy more,"" says Honor Strachan, principal retail analyst at GlobalData.  ""They're getting more for their money."" But how do companies manage this kind of discrepancy; with precisely the same product priced significantly differently depending on where in the world it is bought? After all a boom in revenues in one market, can seriously dent demand in the markets international shoppers are coming from.  Many of the world's most famous brands — such as Burberry and Apple — simply raised their UK prices to try and make sure what they sold cost broadly the same across their international markets. But luxury footwear brand Crockett & Jones, which has 12 stores worldwide across locations including London, Paris and New York as well as global wholesale partners, says it has deliberately left prices unchanged.  ""The last thing we want to do is abuse our customer confidence and raise prices in the UK. ""We certainly don't increase our prices at a whim to take advantage of said currency fluctuations,"" says James Fox, export sales director at the firm.  Mr Fox believes that in the long term it's best to keep pricing simple. ""We strive to have a level playing field as and where we can.  ""We offer sterling, euro and dollar price lists, which gives our customers piece of mind that they are buying in their own currency at a level price to the potential competitors within their market."" He says generally any discrepancies tend to average out across currencies, and that re-pricing is only possible ""once or twice a year"" due to the upheaval it causes for the business overall. So is he concerned that the firm could be losing out financially? ""We are fortunate to be in a position that we have a few very strong 'Brexit proof' markets which underpin the company when the UK is trying its best to screw up international trade,"" says Mr Fox. By selling both through its own stores and through wholesalers the firm's risk is already spread out, he adds.  Crockett & Jones is not the only retailer which has kept prices steady.  Ray Clacher, executive vice-president at Trinity - owner of premium brands Gieves & Hawkes, Kent & Curwen and Cerruti 1881 - says non-EU tourists using either the US dollar or a currency that trades in line with the dollar, have driven up sales at its London stores. Nonetheless, these sales are still just a small percentage of Trinity's total revenue. ""We certainly have not adjusted our retail prices to reflect the influx of tourism, in fact, quite the opposite as we want to encourage more UK [sales],"" he says. However, he admits this strategy could change if costs continue to rise.  ""If inflation continues to rise and sterling continues to struggle against the euro and dollar, we will have no choice but to pass on the cost to our customers - but not at present,"" says Mr Clacher.

But it is also important not to be too greedy. Many US retailers that have come to the UK have simply swapped their dollar signs on their US price tags for pounds - betting that British consumers will be willing to pay a premium for their goods. Banana Republic is one such example. After eight years in the UK, it announced last year it would close all eight of its stores. The decision followed six consecutive quarters of falling sales.  ""They thought that because they were a big brand, they could demand higher prices. But UK consumers ""are savvier than that,"" says Ms Strachan. Yet for retailers doing a straight currency conversion from their local currency to the country where they are selling their goods also doesn't necessarily work.  ""Asos made a big thing about launching local websites with a straight currency conversion and it didn't work - local pricing didn't fit in line with competitors.  ""Brands need to look at who else is operating in that space, the wealth of consumers there, and what they're willing to pay, and then price accordingly using localised pricing structures,"" says Ms Strachan. Many firms, particularly larger brands such as Hermes also use currency hedging to protect themselves. This involves working with a bank to buy currency at the current rate to protect themselves against adverse future volatility. In the end, though Ms Strachan says a company's ability to cope with currency volatility comes down to how much people want to buy what they sell. ""If they still want it customers will buy it,"" she says."
Volatility,UK to discuss oil stability with Saudi Arabia,2024-09-25,2022-03-14,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-60739690,"The UK government is to discuss how to diversify energy supply following disruption caused by the war in Ukraine, Downing Street has said. Petrol prices for UK drivers have reached record highs of more than £1.60 a litre in recent days. The PM's spokesman said discussions with Saudi officials would look to tackle market volatility but there were no ""quick fixes"" available. It comes after 81 men were executed in Saudi Arabia on Saturday. Foreign Office Minister Amanda Milling said the British government was ""deeply shocked"" by the executions, and opposed the use of the death penalty in all circumstances. Replying to an urgent question from Conservative MP Crispin Blunt, she said the issue had already been raised with the Saudi authorities, and the government would continue to ""speak frankly"" about human rights.  Mr Blunt said the executions were ""appalling"" and had presented the prime minister with ""exquisite difficulties"" when asking Saudi Arabia for help in easing oil shortages.  Ms Milling told MPs the UK was phasing out Russian oil, adding that it was important to have stability in energy markets, and there was a role for OPEC - of which Saudi Arabia is a key member - in this.  Human rights groups say many of those executed did not receive fair trials, but the Saudi government denies this. The average price of petrol for UK drivers hit £1.63 a litre on Sunday, with the Russian invasion of Ukraine pushing up costs. Asked whether the UK wanted Saudi Arabia - the world's second-biggest oil producer - to increase supplies, the prime minister's official spokesman said: ""We will be speaking to the Saudis about a range of issues, not just energy supply. ""Diversifying our energy supply is important, as is boosting renewable energy. There are no quick fixes but we do want to reduce the volatility and bring prices down."" Boris Johnson held a meeting with ministers and leaders of gas and oil companies - including Shell, Esso and BP - on Monday, during which he voiced a ""firm commitment"" to continuing extractions from the North Sea. They agreed to work to ""remove barriers facing investors and developers, and help projects come online more quickly"", Downing Street said. Saudi Arabia says those executed on Saturday, including seven Yemenis and one Syrian national, had been convicted of ""multiple heinous crimes"", including terrorism, torture, rape and weapons smuggling. The number put to death exceeded the 69 who faced that fate during the whole of 2021. ""The UK is firmly opposed to the death penalty in every country as a matter of principle,"" the PM's spokesman said.  ""We continue to raise human rights issues with other countries including Saudi Arabia. We do not shy away from raising these issues with our partners."" In the Commons, Labour's spokesman Bambos Charalambous said it was no coincidence that the Saudis had carried out the mass executions while the world's attention was elsewhere.  Responding to reports that Boris Johnson is to visit Riyadh, the SNP spokesman, Alyn Smith, said no such visit should take place, after what he described as an ""atrocity"". "
Volatility,"Sun, stars and saliva - the Cannes 2021 highlights",2024-09-25,2021-07-16,By Helen Bushby,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-57864015,"The Cannes Film Festival is drawing to a close, and despite the pandemic it managed to gather a larger number film stars in the sunshine for the obligatory photo opportunities.  This distinctive line-up of director Wes Anderson and actors Timothee Chalamet, Tilda Swinton and Bill Murray for their film The French Dispatch proved irresistible as a meme.  Jessica Shortall described the line-up as ""Tiktok-LinkedIn-Instagram-Twitter"", while Philip Bump dubbed them ""Z, X, Millennial, Boomer"". Sara Wallace Goodman spoke for many of us when she described the stars' fashions as: ""Zoom presentation attire, remembering how I dressed before Zoom, imagining how I'll dress after Zoom, how I'll actually dress after Zoom."" That picture became one of the viral moments from the prestigious festival, but there were plenty of other talking points. The Covid safety procedures included saliva tests for those outside the EU's Covid tracking system. In other words, attendees had to dispense with any delusions of glamour and spit into a pot. The Wrap's Ben Croll wrote that booking a test was ""painless enough"", but ""the process of generating enough saliva, however, requires a bit more finesse"" - describing being handed a vial to fill, which was checked for quality and quantity.  The Guardian's Xan Brooks said a medic sternly told him: ""Only the liquid is good. The froth doesn't count.""  Vulture's Nate Jones added that the French event had ""become an odyssey of spit"", while Variety's Ramin Setoodeh described ""audible sighs of frustration among those waiting in line when they realised just how much saliva the lab needed from them"".  Hollywood actor Matt Damon and Call My Agent's Camille Cottin added some star wattage for Stillwater, which got a five-minute standing ovation.  Variety's executive editor Ramin Setoodeh said Damon was brought to tears by the applause. He plays an American oil rig roughneck who travels to Marseille to visit his estranged daughter, who is in prison for a murder she says she did not commit.  IndieWire's Anne Thompson said Todd McCarthy's film got ""solid"" early reviews and that the director ""effectively draws the audience into this shut-down man's dawning awareness of an emotional life beyond the confines of Oklahoma oilfields"". Empire's Ian Freer said the film ""mashes up quest-for-justice, father-daughter dramatics, fortysomething romance and mid-life introspection for a refreshingly adult drama"". The Spectator's Stephen Arnell said this year's festival was ""a bumper event with a wealth of backlogged movies on offer for film-starved cineastes"", with Val - a documentary chronicling the highs, lows and cancer battle of US actor Kilmer - as his top pick. He also highlighted the musical Annette, which opened the festival, but suggested it would be ""something of a Marmite experience for cinema-goers"". It stars Adam Driver as edgy comedian Henry, married to renowned soprano Ann (Marion Cotillard), with a newborn daughter Annette who is actually a puppet with strange abilities. Variety's Richard Lawson called the film ""daring and garish"", but Screen Daily's Jonathan Romney said it was ""an audacious folly that comes across as grandiose and joyless"". Tatler's Danielle Lawler also recommended Annette along with The French Dispatch, which she called an ""ensemble of epic proportions"" with a cast that also includes Willem Dafoe, Frances McDormand and Saoirse Ronan. She called the film, which is based on a collection of short stories originally published in The French Dispatch magazine, ""a dreamy blockbuster for these times"". Flag Day, directed by Sean Penn and starring the actor alongside his daughter Dylan and son Hopper, was also highlighted. It is based on a young woman's relationship with her father, who she discovers led a double life as a conman. The Hollywood Reporter's David Rooney said it ""succumbs to Penn's worst indulgences, loading up on big actor-ish explosions of volatility rather than trying to get to the lost soul of a desperate man and the yearning of a daughter"".  But Deadline's Pete Hammond added that it would be ""remembered as a dazzling showcase for the acting talents of his daughter"". Regardless of what is happening on screen, there will always be more interest in what's happening on the red carpet.  Actress Sharon Stone wore a Dolce & Gabbana dress bedecked in flowers for the screening of The Story of My Wife, about a sea captain who makes a bet in a cafe with a friend that he will marry the first woman who walks in.  Stone's co-star Lea Seydoux was unable to attend because she contracted Covid, so Stone, a veteran of the Cannes red carpet, having attended for Basic Instinct in 1992, made the most of the limelight. She was variously described as stunning, dazzling and stealing the show in the most beautiful dress at Cannes."
Volatility,The race is on to solve the UK's energy crisis,2024-09-25,2022-03-12,By Ione Wells,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-60712673,"There's a new buzz phrase in government: energy independence. The war in Ukraine has focused ministers' minds on the need to stop procuring energy from abroad and, when it comes to Russia, financing a foe in the process.  One backbench Tory MP did not mince his words, telling me ""every missile dropped on Ukraine has been financed by the West buying Russian gas"". The challenge ahead for ministers is twofold: making sure we have enough energy to heat our homes, power our businesses and fuel our cars - and making sure it does not become so unaffordable that businesses collapse and households are pushed into poverty. So what's the plan? Well, the week after next, the prime minister and business secretary are expected to set out their ""energy supply strategy"". It's likely to focus on four core areas: nuclear energy, renewable energy, making homes more energy efficient, and increasing North Sea oil and gas production. On that last point: government sources insist this is not about burning more gas, but about sourcing more gas domestically while the UK moves to renewable energy sources.  Downing Street is adamant their net zero targets remain intact - despite opposition from a Net Zero Scrutiny group of backbench Tory MPs.  A source said cheaper energy from the sun, wind and nuclear was the ""only real long-term answer to the cost of living crisis"" and they ""can't bung people subsidies forever because prices are high"". It now looks increasingly likely, for example, that planning laws could be loosened for onshore wind farms. Ahead of the government's energy supply strategy, the prime minister is speaking to leaders of major oil producing countries around the world this coming week. I'm also told Boris Johnson will be making announcements imminently about a new team of advisers to ""kick"" business into accelerating renewable energy plans.  I'm told these will include ""one of the most distinguished industry experts out there"" and energy finance experts who will form an ""independent energy task force"" - as well as a cabinet sub-committee of ministers.  There is also a growing caucus of Tory MPs, including former ministers Lord Frost and Steve Baker, calling for the government to re-examine the controversial practice of fracking in the UK - drilling down into the earth to release shale gas. A ban was placed on fracking in 2019 due to earthquake safety concerns, and the Tory manifesto said they would ""not support fracking unless the science shows categorically that it can be done safely"". Many of its proponents, however, got excited this week after No 10 suggested the prime minister has agreed to look at it again to ""see if it has a role to play"". Downing Street sources told me that with oil prices so high, there were things ""we would have dismissed before that we can't dismiss now"" - and while their end goal is new sources of energy, ""in the transition period we need to pump more oil and gas of our own"" and it's ""in that context we should look at fracking"".  Fracking has its champions in cabinet, with Brexit opportunities minister Jacob Rees-Mogg said to be ""extremely keen"" on the idea. But the reality is the prime minister himself sees a lot of problems with it. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has also pretty stridently distanced himself from entertaining the idea.  Other senior government insiders feel, for all the talk of the door being left open to it, that this is partly to keep some of the more vocal backbenchers happy - with one saying they would be ""staggered"" if the prime minister folded on it.  Another joked, in response to various newspaper headlines, that you could say the Tory manifesto left the door open to fracking if the science changed - but that it hadn't.  While renewable energy is heralded as the solution to the cost of living crisis long-term, a more pressing political debate is how to mitigate soaring energy bills for households right now.  No 10 commissioned the business secretary and his team to come up with ideas for the upcoming energy supply strategy - including help for consumers.  The team distanced themselves from taking any particular view on this issue, but the options they set out were tweaks to the Treasury's energy bill rebate scheme - £200 loans for customers to be repaid in £40 instalments from 2023.  These included doubling the loan, delaying the start of repayments, and making the rebate more generous for poorer households.  The Treasury - who were not looped into this particular commission involving their policy - quickly shut down the idea of any changes to the rebate scheme being on the table.  Government insiders feel that, broadly, Tory MPs are content with the policy that was announced - although one described an internal ""wobble"" when the personal finance expert Martin Lewis publicly cast doubt on the ""loan"" element of the scheme.  But Tory MPs have been more vocal in calling for other government interventions on the cost of living. Some want green levies or VAT on energy bills to be scrapped, the National Insurance rise scrapped, fuel duty cut, or further boosts to benefits like Universal Credit or the Warm Homes Discount.  While a Treasury source said the chancellor will ""always review our policies and how we can help"", it's unlikely these calls will be heeded at his upcoming Spring Statement on 23 March for reasons we set out here.  The National Insurance tax rise is definitely going ahead in April, and scrapping VAT or green levies on energy bills are ""not a go-er"", sources say.  The chancellor is not expected to tweak tax policy this month, which rules out cutting fuel duty for now, though it remains frozen.  MPs are getting noisier about pump prices though, and the door doesn't seem completely closed to further intervention should fuel prices continue to spiral.  Further boosting welfare benefits like Universal Credit and the Warm Homes Discount is also a thorny issue for the Conservatives.  One government insider stressed that the party has argued for years they need to ""make work pay"", another described expanding these benefits further could be a ""disincentive to work"". The logic behind the energy bills rebate scheme, too, was that it applied to middle income, as well as the poorest, households - all affected by energy bill increases.  But critical Tories, including some former work and pensions secretaries, have argued unprecedented price rises since the pandemic demand a more generous approach to welfare. Treasury sources have downplayed the suggestion that we are likely to see any major new cost of living announcements at the Spring Statement given the volatility of the current situation - and not being able to predict what gas prices will look like by October, when the energy price cap (the maximum households can pay for bills) is set to rise again.  But a Treasury source said: ""We've essentially come up from a once in a lifetime crisis with the pandemic and straight into the next crisis… we will keep continuing to look at ways we can help people out.""

Volatility,On the border beat in County Armagh,2024-09-25,2018-11-17,By Chris Page,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-46235640,"On the border beat in in County Armagh - policing is not like anywhere else in the UK. When I accompanied Sgt Sam Hoey on a drive around his area - we were in a convoy of four armoured cars. ""We're not just worried about the threat for dissident republicans,"" the experienced officer explains. ""We're also worried about being rammed by other vehicles, and being run over or blocked in places."" On the narrow, single-track roads - where it is difficult for non-locals to know where the border actually is - it is easy to see how police would be vulnerable to anyone who would want to trap them.  As well as dealing with crime which can happen anywhere - such as burglary, domestic violence and drink-driving - the presence of the border means there is a specific threat from organised crime gangs, who are involved in smuggling on either side of the border to  Sgt Hoey's radio crackles with a call-sign, and a colleague informs him of an incident in Flurrybridge, very close to the UK's only land frontier.  ""Two boys made off in a van across the border. Windscreen smashed. They've got two boys detained with drugs."" Sgt Hoey points out that is a prime example of co-operation between the Police Service of Northern Ireland and its counterparts in the Irish Republic, An Garda Siochana. PSNI officers and the Garda are in touch on a cross-border radio, and alert each other when a vehicle they are pursuing crosses from one country into another. ""The reason why we can't cross the border is because we're carrying firearms,"" Sgt Hoey tells me. ""So if we crossed into the south, we'd be liable for arrest."" Police officers on both sides have numbered codenames for each border crossing point - or ""BCPs"", as they call them. ""So we'll get a call saying there's a vehicle coming across at BCP 32, for example,"" says Sgt Hoey. There are 55 road BCPs in his district alone - and about 270 in total.  Sgt Hoey joined the police as a part-time reservist in 1989, and moved into the regular force a few years later. He has spent most of his career working near the border - and often reflects on the remarkable change which has taken place.  He points out a hill just outside Newry where there used to be a military watchtower. He and colleagues would have been flown to and from it by helicopter, or walked to it if there was bad weather.  At the beginning of his time in the police, he did not patrol by car at all.  ""The threat was just so high of land mines,"" he says. ""Two police officers would be walking about with 10 or 12 soldiers."" Over the course of the peace process, the police have spent years building up relationships with communities which had been historically hostile.   In South Armagh, there are still some villages where they ""don't get many calls"", according to Sgt Hoey - but he can see that gradually changing. Likewise, the number of signs on lamp posts with messages like ""No RUC here"" are dwindling.  But signs expressing opinions about Brexit are common sights on our journey. The messages include ""No Hard Border Here,"" and ""Stand Against Brexit."" The PSNI Chief Constable, George Hamilton, and his team of senior officers are examining what the UK's departure from the EU might mean for them. As well as the impact of any potential changes to the border arrangements - he identifies a general increased focus on identity issues, among both unionists and nationalists, as something which may lead to increased challenges for police.  Mr Hamilton told me: ""We just know what it is like policing the volatility of Northern Ireland, and these issues of identity and uncertainty often lead to an increase in tension."" He is employing 102 extra officers between now and the end of this financial year, which is close to the date when the UK is leaving the EU.  But there's likely to be a bid to the government to fund more more - though exactly how many depends on the shape of Brexit. While he warns that even a Brexit deal would not resolve all the issues for police - because ""the terms of that deal may not meet with agreement from everyone"" - he also suggests that he'd expect to need more policing resources to deal with the consequences if there was not a deal.  Back on the border beat, Sgt Hoey hopes what he describes as the ""massive progress"" of the last few years continues.  I'm not a politician, I'm a police officer,"" he says.  ""But small decisions that are made for us can have massive implications for me working along the border."""
Volatility,Review calls for independent regulator,2024-09-25,2021-11-24,BBC Sport,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/59406087,"This video can not be played Independent regulator will strengthen English football - Tracey Crouch MP English football needs an independent regulator to stop it ""lurching from crisis to crisis"", says the chair of a fan-led review into the sport. Former sports minister Tracey Crouch is calling on the government to create a new independent regulator for English football (IREF). The review says this is necessary for the long-term financial stability of the men's professional game. ""This is a huge opportunity for football,"" Crouch told BBC Sport. ""We've seen football lurching from crisis to crisis over the past decade and unfortunately we haven't had the right levels of regulation in place to stop that from happening."" BBC Sport understands that Downing Street will support the plan for an independent regulator. Speaking to BBC sports editor Dan Roan, Crouch added that the recommendations were to remove ""vested interests"" from football to ensure it can ""become sustainable for the long-term future"". The review, which was commissioned by the government, also recommends Premier League clubs paying a ""solidarity transfer levy"" to further support the football pyramid. It suggests clubs should have a 'shadow board' of fans so they are properly consulted on key decisions and that supporters hold a 'golden share' to protect their clubs' heritage and which competitions they play in. The review also proposes new owners' and directors' tests and that these are carried out by IREF instead of the Premier League, English Football League (EFL) and the Football Association (FA). Crouch said she is ""absolutely confident"" that such measures would stop any revival of the failed European Super League or a similar breakaway competition and would prevent a club going bust in the manner Bury FC did in 2019. She added she is ""extremely optimistic"" the government will support the idea of an independent regulator but said legislation will not be in place by the start of next season. However, she said a 'shadow regulator' could be set up 'straight away' to establish the guiding principles for IREF. The Premier League said it recognises the need to ""restore and retain"" the trust of fans in football governance and that it will study the recommendations before working with the government, fans, FA and EFL on these issues. The EFL said it hopes the review is a ""catalyst for positive change that can make clubs sustainable"". The FA said ""many positive changes have already been made"", some of which were ""directly as a result"" of the review. The Football Supporters' Association (FSA) said the review ""lay the basis for a prosperous and sustainable future"" for English football at all levels. The report makes 47 recommendations, which are summed up in 10 major points: The government should create a new independent regulator (IREF) IREF should oversee financial regulation in football IREF should establish new owners' and directors' tests A new corporate governance code should be set up Equality, diversity and inclusion plans should be mandatory for all clubs Supporters should be consulted on all key off-field decisions through a 'shadow board' Key items of club heritage should be protected by a 'golden share' for fans There should be more support from the Premier League to the pyramid through a solidarity transfer levy, paid by Premier League clubs on buying players from overseas or other top-flight clubs Women's football should be treated equally and given its own review Stakeholders should work to increase protection of welfare of players leaving the game The Premier League's owners' and directors' test has come under scrutiny recently following the Saudi Arabian-backed takeover of Newcastle. Amnesty International has urged the league to change the test to address human rights issues, with the Saudi state accused of human rights abuses. The Premier League said it has ""legally-binding assurances"" the Saudi state has no direct control over Newcastle, despite the Public Investment Fund (PIF), which has an 80% stake, being chaired by Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman. Western intelligence agencies believe the crown prince approved the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, which he denies. The review did not state whether human rights issues would be considered in the new proposed tests but did say owners and directors must be of ""good character"" to pass. Crouch said she did not know if the new tests would have blocked the Newcastle takeover but added they would have ensured ""greater transparency"". The Premier League and EFL agreed a £250m rescue package for EFL clubs in light of the Covid-19 pandemic in December last year, before the top flight made another £25m available to Leagues One and Two and the National League last week. The review says the proposed transfer levy will add to that and work in a similar way to stamp duty, external in order to ""distribute revenues across the pyramid and into grassroots"". Crouch said the Premier League ""has a duty"" to pass more of its wealth down - but that both it and the EFL need to come to a decision on what the levy percentage should be. If they cannot agree, she said IREF will make the decision on their behalf. Football fans protested outside stadiums following the announcement of the European Super League in April The review heard more than 100 hours of evidence from fans representing more than 130 clubs, the FA, Premier League, EFL, League Managers' Association and Professional Footballers' Association. The government promised a fan-led review in its 2019 general election manifesto after Bury were expelled from League One following the collapse of a takeover bid. The review was brought forward as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, which caused matches to be held behind closed doors, affecting revenue, and the failed attempt to launch a 12-team European Super League in April. The review's recommendations seek to address concerns over the financial disparity between the Premier League and the Championship, with clubs in the second tier breaching profitability and sustainability rules in attempts to gain promotion. This has been apparent this season with Reading deducted six points for breaking financial rules and Derby County docked a further nine points for breaches of EFL accounting rules, taking their overall deductions this season to 21 points. The European Super League, which involved six Premier League clubs, collapsed amid widespread condemnation from other clubs and players as well as governing bodies, politicians and especially fans. The review's 'golden share' proposal seeks to prevent this being attempted again as it gives fans a say over a club's heritage - including team colours and their stadium, as well as preventing them from playing in competitions not affiliated to Fifa, Uefa or the FA. The Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee chair Julian Knight MP said he welcomed the proposal of an independent football regulator. He said there must be ""urgent government action"" and called on Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries to introduce a football regulator in the next Queen's Speech. The Premier League said: ""We acknowledge the call for some form of independent regulation to protect English football's essential strengths and the Premier League has already undertaken our own governance and strategic reviews. ""These will continue to progress together with the ongoing work of the fan-led review. ""It is important to everyone that any reforms do not damage our game, its competitive balance or the levels of current investment."" EFL chairman Rick Parry said it is ""pleasing"" to see the review conclude that ""additional distributions"" from the top flight are required. He added: ""Achieving financial stability has to be the number one priority. ""Reducing volatility and fostering balance throughout the English leagues will provide the bedrock upon which reforms can be built."" Football Supporters' Association chief executive Kevin Miles said the review is ""potentially a huge step forward for football governance"" and that is ""now up to the government to deliver"". And the Manchester United Supporters Trust said the review included a ""big missed opportunity"" because of its ""failure to address the fundamental question of club ownership"". The Trust said it ""should have recommended measures to allow supporters who wish to invest in their club to do so""."
Volatility,Dow sheds more than 4% twice in week,2024-09-25,2018-02-08,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42991310,"Wall Street shares slid sharply again on Thursday, compounding losses on the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 which started last week.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by more than 1,000 points for the second time this week, plunging 4.15% to 23,860. The S&P 500 dropped 100.6 points or 3.75% to 2,581, while the Nasdaq slid 274.8 points or 3.9% to 6,777.1. The moves follow a day of losses on all key European exchanges. The 100 share index in London closed down 1.49% at 7,170.69 points. Germany and France fell 2.6% and 2% respectively. The dive extends a sell-off that started last week, as investors started to worry that inflation might rise more quickly than expected, leading policymakers to raise interest rates. On Thursday, the Bank of England seemed to offer support for that view. The bank left interest rates where they were at 0.5% at its meeting, but said a strengthening economy meant interest rates were likely to rise sooner than the markets were expecting. Also worrying markets was a government budget proposal US lawmakers in Congress have announced, which raises spending caps and could fan inflation.  Bond yields in the US have also risen in recent weeks, typically a signal of higher rates. Higher interest rates push up borrowing costs for companies and individuals, which can hurt corporate profits and curb economic activity. The uptick in volatility comes as investors react to the shifting conditions. Thursday's declines mean the Dow and S&P 500 have now fallen by more than 10% from the record highs set in January, a threshold analysts call a correction. Shares in financial, technology and consumer companies led the declines on Thursday, which infected every sector. American Express and Intel were the two biggest losers on the Dow. Analysts, who have said for months that the financial markets were due a correction after a long period of rising prices, urged calm. ""The latest decline takes us back to where we were 17 November,"" said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com, which tracks interest rates. ""We've just given back some recent gains, not wiped out anyone's life savings.""  But the declines have led to questions for President Donald Trump, who had repeatedly boasted of the market's rapid rise in value last year. The White House said on Thursday markets were reacting to data that is good news for the broader economy, including low unemployment and signs of wage growth. ""The president like the rest of the White House is concerned about long term economic indicators and factors,"" a White House spokesman said. ""The fundamentals in terms of the long term are very strong."""
Volatility,UK economic outlook lowered to negative – Moody’s,2024-09-25,2022-10-21,By Michael Race,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63352556,"The UK's economic outlook has been lowered to ""negative"" by ratings agency Moody's due to political instability and high inflation. Moody's changed the UK's outlook - which is a marker of how likely it is to pay back debts - from ""stable"". Rating agencies, in essence, rate a country on the strength of its economy. Moody's along with another of the big credit rating agencies Standard & Poor's (S&P) maintained their assessments of the UK's credit rating.  Rating agencies give governments (or large companies) a score on how likely they are to pay back their debt. The rating affects how much it costs governments to borrow money in the international financial markets. In theory, a high credit rating means a lower interest rate (and vice versa). Each agency gives countries around the world a specific credit rating score. These range from a top mark of ""AAA"", which stands for ""prime"", down to the lowest reading of ""D"", which stands for ""in default"". Moody's said there were ""risks to the UK's debt affordability"", but kept its rating of Aa3, the fourth-highest level on its scale. Meanwhile, S&P maintained the UK's rating of AA - its third highest rating level - and maintained its previously-changed outlook from stable to negative. The reports published on Friday do not mean the UK's credit rating has been downgraded, but a negative outlook indicates it could be downgraded at a later date. The other outlooks countries can be given are positive, or stable, and any outlook period typically lasts 12 to 18 months.  Moody's said there were two ""drivers"" behind its decision to change the UK's economic outlook. It said the first was ""the increased risk to the UK's credit profile from the heightened unpredictability in policymaking amid a volatile domestic political landscape"". Moody's said this challenged the UK's ""ability to manage the shock arising from weaker growth prospects and high inflation"". The rating's agency said it viewed the government's mini-budget, the reversal of the majority of the policies in it, and the change in prime minister as a ""continuing reflection of the weakening predictability of fiscal policymaking seen in previous years"". Moody's assessment comes after government borrowing costs rose sharply in the aftermath of the mini-budget in September when investors became spooked by the then chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng pledging huge tax cuts without saying how the government would pay for them. The current chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, reversed the majority of the tax cuts from the mini-budget on Monday in attempt to calm the markets, but the resignation of Prime Minister Liz Truss means economic policies are on hold. ""The government's initial inability to deliver a credible policy response to address investor concerns around this unfunded stimulus further weakened the UK's policy credibility, which is unlikely to be fully restored by the subsequent decision to reverse most of the tax cuts,"" Moody's said. Moody's said the second driver of its decision to change the outlook was the ""heightened risks to the UK's debt affordability from likely higher borrowing and the risk of more persistent inflation"". A spokesman for the Treasury said global financial markets had been ""subject to significant volatility in recent weeks"". ""While no national government can eliminate this, we can give certainty about the sustainability of public finances in the UK,"" a statement added.  ""The underlying fundamentals of the British economy remain strong, with the UK having the second lowest net debt to GDP ratio in the G7 and unemployment at its lowest level in almost 50 years."" The spokesman said the government was focused on ""delivering economic stability and sustainable growth"". Government borrowing costs rose on Friday, while the pound sank as investors reacted to gloomy economic data amid the political turmoil. It clawed back some losses on Friday evening and was back up to around $1.12 against the dollar. The interest rate - or yield - on bonds due to be repaid in 30 years' time rose back above 4%, making government borrowing more expensive. They had hit 5.17% in the aftermath of the mini-budget. Meanwhile, the yield on bonds due to be repaid in five years' time, which underpins the cost of new five-year fixed rate mortgages, rose to 4.09%. The Treasury said the chancellor would set out how the government will get debt falling on 31 October, alongside a full forecast from the Office for Budget Responsibility on his economic policies."
Volatility,Asia's richest man hits back at 'con' claims,2024-09-25,2023-01-26,By Nikhil Inamdar  and Monica Miller,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-64408720,"A company owned by Asia's richest man has hit back at a report which accused the firm of ""brazen"" stock manipulation and accounting fraud. The Adani Group, founded by Gautam Adani, called the report by a US investment firm ""malicious"" and ""selective misinformation"". The group lost almost $11bn (£8.7bn) of its market value after the research was made public on Wednesday. It is now considering legal action against New York's Hindenburg Research. Adani Group is one of India's biggest companies, and has operations in a wide range of industries including commodities trading, airports, utilities and renewable energy. It is led by Indian billionaire Mr Adani who is the world's fourth richest man, according to Forbes magazine.   Hindenburg, meanwhile, specialises in ""short-selling"", or betting against a company's share price in the expectation that it will fall.  In its report, Hindenburg accused Mr Adani of ""pulling the largest con in corporate history"". This came days ahead of a planned sale of Adani Group shares to the public. The report questioned the Adani Group's ownership of companies in offshore tax havens such as  Mauritius and the Caribbean. It also claimed Adani companies had ""substantial debt"" which put the entire group on a ""precarious financial footing"". But on Thursday, Adani Group said it was evaluating ""remedial and punitive action"" against Hindenburg Research in the US and India. Adani said it had always been ""in compliance with all laws"". ""The volatility in Indian stock markets created by the report is of great concern and has led to unwanted anguish for Indian citizens,"" said the group head of Adani's legal team, Jatin Jalundhwala.   ""Clearly, the report and its unsubstantiated contents were designed to have a deleterious effect on the share values of Adani Group companies as Hindenburg Research, by their own admission, is positioned to benefit from a slide in Adani shares."" On Thursday, Hindenburg responded to Adani's comments, saying the firm had not addressed ""a single substantive issue we had raised"". It also said it stood by its report and would ""welcome"" legal action, as any claim against it would be ""meritless"".  The group's flagship firm, Adani Enterprises, is scheduled to begin selling its shares to the public on Friday.  Opposition politicians who have long alleged that Mr Adani has benefitted because of his proximity to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi have been quick to react to the report. ""Considering that detailed research is out in the public domain, it is important that the government of India takes note of the charges made,"" tweeted Priyanka Chaturvedi, member of parliament and a Shiv Sena party leader. Another popular South Indian politician, Mr KT Ramarao, called on India's investigative agencies and market regulator to open a probe into the Adani Group's operations. But regulators are unlikely to initiate any action independently, say experts. ""The Security and Exchange Board of India [which regulates listed companies in India] will act only if there is a specific complaint sent to it. And in this case there isn't,"" said Shriram Subramaniam, founder and managing director of InGovern Research, a consultancy that advises investors on governance issues. ""There are many allegations in the report that have been the subject of regulatory scrutiny in the past."" The BBC contacted the market regulator but received no response. While it appears that the decks are clear for Adani Group to proceed with its $2.4bn public share sale on Friday, the allegations in the report could put some investors off, said Ambareesh Baliga, a financial markets analyst.  But the report could have broader consequences that go beyond the Adani Group.  Andy Mukherjee, a columnist at the news service Bloomberg, said that beyond Adani, there were ""many questions about the integrity of the broader Indian market, which is caught between the pressures of financial globalisation and political nationalism"". He added: ""Is the Security and Exchange Board of India waiting for a public outcry to go in and clean up the market?"" "
Volatility,School funding boost to reverse cuts,2024-09-25,2019-09-04,By Sean Coughlan,https://www.bbc.com/news/education-49580350,"Schools in England will receive £2.6bn extra next year under Chancellor Sajid Javid's spending plans. This will be the first step towards reversing budget cuts and returning school funding to pre-austerity levels. The announcement follows last week's unveiling of a three-year plan to boost school funding by £7.1bn by 2022-23. School leaders have raised concerns about relying on a funding plan that will take three years at a time of such political and economic volatility. The chancellor told the House of Commons putting more money into schools was investing in ""lifelines of opportunity"". This announcement, relating to spending for 2020-21, confirms the first slice of Prime Minister Boris Johnson's pledge to significantly increase school spending. When it was outlined last week, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said the full three-year funding package would be sufficient to reverse the budget reductions of the past decade. Mr Javid said improving school funding was vital to ""national renewal"" and schools that had been underfunded would receive the biggest increases. His plans will mean: The promise of more money for schools follows a long-running campaign over cash shortages - with head teachers writing to millions of parents about budget problems. Along with supporting the NHS and increasing police numbers, school funding has been seen by the government as a priority for the public. The extra cash announced by the chancellor will deliver a real-terms increase. The £2.6bn for the first year includes about £1.8bn in additional money, above the increase that would have been in the pipeline from rising pupil numbers and inflation. And the government has separately committed to spending an extra £1.5bn per year to cover the rising costs of school staff pensions. For the third year of the package - the £7.1bn increase - this will be worth £4.6bn extra after inflation is taken into account. Jules White, the West Sussex head teacher who has organised a campaign involving thousands of schools, described the funding increase as a ""welcome step in the right direction"".  But, he said, the initial £2.6bn announced would still leave ""some way to go"" before pre-austerity spending levels were reached. ""At a time of deep political uncertainty, relentlessly reasonable head teachers will monitor the situation and take time to consider our next steps,"" he said. Paul Whiteman, leader of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: ""We've won the argument that the Treasury needed to come up with new money. ""The government has made a significant stride in the right direction and the money that's been announced is good news - but we're not there yet and we can see where some of the gaps still remain.""  Kevin Courtney, joint leader of the National Education Union, said the funding promises ""go some way towards closing the gap, but are still significantly short of what is required"". Labour's shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, had rejected the three-year funding plan as a ""con trick"" that would still leave schools waiting years for funding they needed straight away."
Volatility,Four big things stopping voters from making a decision,2024-09-25,2019-12-09,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50637620,"Not yet made up your mind how to vote on Thursday? You're not alone. Three days before the election, many voters are struggling to find a party that offers what they want.  This is a snapshot of the undecided voters of 2019. The BBC has commissioned an opinion research consultancy, Britain Thinks, to put together a sample of voters - representative in age, location, gender, race, class and voting history. Some common themes emerge: the NHS, Brexit, a lack of trust in politicians and money. We asked our participants to fill in a survey about themselves, their voting history - and what's stopping them from making up their minds. The answers below have been edited for clarity. Then it's over to our correspondents to tell us what the answers reveal about the voters in 2019 - and why so many of them are dissatisfied with the choice on offer.  For many of our participants, such as Rob, Kate, Rachel and Leanne (left to right, below) the NHS and its future are among their top concerns.  For Sutton Coldfield resident Rob, 48, the NHS is by far the most important issue of the campaign. He's a regular at the gym, and credits his wife with keeping him and their son on a healthy diet. He voted Remain in 2016, and Labour at the last three elections. The NHS is ""a fantastic service that underpins who we are as a nation"", he says. ""It deserves every penny and more that it can get from the public purse."" Thirty-six-year-old Kate also lives in Sutton Coldfield and is frustrated with the number of people who don't turn up for NHS appointments, when she has to wait days to get one. She voted solidly Conservative in the last three elections and Leave in 2016. ""I believe they should operate a three-strikes-and-out policy. If you miss three appointments without notification or a genuine reason (eg hospitalisation), you should be charged before a doctor will see you again.""  Rachel, 49, worries about over-stretched GPs and mental health services, as well as the difficulty of retaining qualified staff. Her youngest son had to wait six hours to get his suspected fractured wrist looked at. Rachel, who lives in Cheshire and works as a teaching assistant, has voted Lib Dem (2017), Labour (2015) and Conservative (2010). She didn't vote in the 2016 referendum. ""What we do not want is an American-style system,"" she says.  Self-described ""fitness fanatic"" Leanne, 34, is suspicious of claims that the NHS will be privatised or sold to the Americans. She voted Leave in 2016 and Conservative in 2010, 2015 and 2017. She says friends and family who work for the NHS are under enormous pressure. ""How will our NHS be managed from now on to ensure that our population is cared for correctly?"" she wants to know.  The NHS has undoubtedly been one of the key issues of the election. That should come as no surprise - Lord Lawson, a former Conservative chancellor, perhaps best summed it up when he said the NHS was the ""closest thing the English people have to a religion"". The parties have tried to outdo each other with their attempts to be seen as the party of the NHS, promising extra funding, increases in staff and more money for buildings. But while the budget has been increasing over the past decade, it has not gone up fast enough to cope with demand. It has meant longer waiting times for all sorts of treatment. The NHS has also been dragged into the Brexit debate, with Labour saying it is at risk from a post-Brexit US trade deal - something the Tories deny. The US pharmaceutical industry would certainly want the NHS to pay more for drugs, but this will undoubtedly be strongly resisted.   Still undecided? More background here: Most of our undecideds want certainty above all. More than three years on from the referendum, the likes of Mark, Chioma, Claire and Leslie (left to right, below) don't understand why Brexit hasn't been resolved, one way or the other.  Mark, 52, owns a small childcare company in London and has two teenage children with his wife, who recently recovered from cancer. She was treated on the NHS, although she has private health insurance. For Mark, a Leave voter, Brexit is the most important issue. ""Who is going to get Brexit done so that the country can move on and business conditions can return to some semblance of normality?"" he asks. Trade, immigration, the NHS: all will be affected by Brexit, says Chioma, 37, a committed Christian originally from Nigeria, now living in Scotland. For that reason, she sees it as the most important issue facing the country. She voted Conservative in 2017 but Labour in 2015 and 2010. She didn't vote in the referendum. ""How soon can Brexit be decided?"" she asks. ""So we can know what we have to work with."" Claire lives in London and teaches adults with learning disabilities. She worries about knife crime and acid attacks in her local area. Claire, who voted Remain in 2016 and Labour in two of the last three elections, thinks Brexit will be ""a disaster"" for the country and wants another referendum. ""I'm worried it's going to be a one-issue election and [I'm] scared that could be very bad for the country. At the same time I think the Brexit question is already damaging Britain and is urgent."" Cheshire-born and bred, Leslie, 64, voted UKIP in 2017, Conservative before that, and Leave in 2016. He's not sure ""which of the main two parties are telling the truth"". He works as an engineer for an Italian company, but the owners haven't wanted to invest in the UK until Brexit is resolved. ""I would like the incoming government to move forward with this issue, then we could have the investment in staff needed,"" he says. He also worries about the impact of Brexit on the NHS and whether medical supplies will be protected.  The trouble with Brexit is that all parties want to make the solutions sound simple, but it's actually a very complicated process. That's because leaving the EU would make huge changes to the way our whole economy operates - and loads of other issues like security cooperation and sharing data with our nearest neighbours would need to be renegotiated as well.  The Tories promise to get Brexit done but they haven't even started trade talks. Labour says it will renegotiate a better deal and hold another referendum, but it's not clear whether it wants to leave or remain. And the Liberal Democrats' manifesto proposed stopping Brexit altogether, in effect ignoring the result of the 2016 referendum without giving anyone another say.  The country has been divided quite sharply - and sometimes unpleasantly - by Brexit. The idea any party will be able to click their fingers and bring those divisions to a sudden end doesn't really stand up to scrutiny.  Whatever happens in this election, Brexit is going to be a long haul.  Still undecided? More background here:  Another thread running through many of our participants' answers is trust - or the lack of it. Just ask Mariam, Akeel, Clive and James (left to right, below). Even if people like what the parties are saying, they don't believe the politicians will deliver.  ""Why should I vote for you? What can you do to benefit people… and genuinely stick to your word?"" Mariam, 24, from London has a challenge for the parties. She voted Conservative in the last two elections but didn't take part in the 2016 referendum. Mariam, who has a two-year-old daughter, is leaning towards voting Labour this time but questions the sincerity of the promises from all parties.  Like Mariam, Akeel abstained in the 2016 referendum. He voted Labour in 2017 and Conservative in 2015. He's a truck driver, 38 years old, who lives in Birmingham and is concerned about the cost of living. He wants a contract with the politicians to hold them to account. ""If you can't do what you say you're going to do, what compensation do the public get?"" Clive, 62, worked in the mining industry and asbestos removal before retiring through ill health. He moved from Derbyshire to London, where he's now a volunteer working with homeless people and substance abusers. His view? ""Promise after promise from Labour or more of the same under the Tories"" - he considers the Lib Dems undemocratic and thinks no other parties have a chance. ""Who is the one that is believable? At the moment none of them are.""  One possible outcome after 12 December is a hung parliament. If that's the case, James, 64 and from Glasgow, wants to know who the parties would work with. ""Don't treat us like little kids as if we know nothing and we need to believe every single word that comes out of their mouths,"" he fumes. He voted for the SNP in the last two elections and Remain in the referendum. He worries about what the future holds, especially the uncertainty over Brexit.  Voters have always distrusted politicians but, at the start of this election campaign, a survey suggested just 14% of British adults believed they could trust them to tell the truth. That's a fall of five percentage points in a year, with politicians displacing advertising executives at the bottom of the truthfulness index. This rise in scepticism coincides with great volatility in UK politics, as the established parties tear themselves apart over Brexit. There have been 90 switches of allegiance by MPs in the past two years, a sign of how old tribalism is weakening. The Brexit divide has cut across traditional lines and that, I think, has added to voter uncertainty as to how individual politicians and indeed political parties will behave. The tone of politics has coarsened and the campaigns appear less bound by principles of honesty and integrity. Still undecided? More background here: There's a lot of worry about public spending and how the parties will pay for their promises, but for many, such as Betty, Amelia, Humza and Gemma (left to right, below) financial concerns lie closer to home.  Betty, who lives in Glasgow, has four children and five grandchildren. A Leave voter, she switched from Labour to the SNP in 2017, as she wanted Scotland's voice to be heard. She worries about the effect of austerity and Brexit on the economy. Her question to the candidates seeking her vote? ""What will you do to ensure that I will be able to pass on my family's inheritance that I have worked hard for?""  While Betty is retired, 18-year-old Amelia is just starting out. She's a first-time voter who'd like another Brexit referendum so that she could vote to remain in the EU. She's preparing for A-levels and, after that, university. ""The large debt for tuition fees combined with maintenance loans will stick with me for a long proportion of my life,"" she says.  Humza, 20, has finished his degree and is now eyeing the next stage: buying a property. He lives with his grandmother in south London and voted Labour in 2017. ""How are we going to tackle the issue of property prices to help people buy their first home for life security?"" he wants to know.  Buying a house with her boyfriend was a major milestone for Gemma, who owns a cleaning business in Nantwich. She voted Leave in 2016 and Liberal Democrat in the election the year before. She thinks the Conservatives are ""more for the wealthy than helping the working/lower class"" but worries about Labour's spending plans.  The undecided voter can often be swayed by what politicians promise for the pound in your pocket. Average hourly wages, after accounting for the rising cost of living, are no higher than they were at the peak of the financial crisis in 2008, and poverty is most likely to be found in working households. People have differing views on who to blame for that, but it does mean household budgets are at the front of many voters' minds. They might also consider the effect this has had on different generations. Put simply, the old have fared better than the young.  All the parties confront this issue in part, particularly targeting young first-time buyers who feel they have been locked out of the property market. There are promises too for a more generous minimum wage, and plans on who to tax or not. But universal benefits for pensioners and the ""triple-lock"" state pension guarantee are untouched. Ultimately, management of the UK economy will have the greatest effect on jobs, wages, and financial prospects.  There are fundamental differences between the parties on how to approach this task. The trouble is, economists at the influential Institute for Fiscal Studies say the spending plans of the biggest two - Labour and the Conservatives - are ""not credible"". Still undecided?

Volatility,Preparing for Brexit,2024-09-25,2018-09-17,By Glenn Campbell,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-45549560,"With the UK due to leave the EU in six months, how ready are Scotland's public bodies for Brexit? A BBC Scotland investigation has attempted to find out. The BBC asked 80 public bodies in Scotland for details of their Brexit preparations and any impact assessments they have carried out, ahead of the planned exit on 29 March 2019. The freedom of information requests revealed widespread concerns about the potential loss of EU migrants from the workforce.  Publicly funded organisations including the NHS, universities and councils are also weighing up a range of other potential Brexit challenges and opportunities. Here are the key findings from the investigation, broken down by sector. NHS Lanarkshire has warned there is a ""very high"" risk it will not be operationally ready for Brexit leading to possible disruption of healthcare services.  The board said it was working with the Scottish government to identify and overcome problems.  Across the health service, there are concerns about access to specialist medicines, equipment and doctors after EU withdrawal.  A paper for the board of NHS national services Scotland raised a concern that Brexit could end UK membership of the European Blood Alliance (EBA).  This could result in ""loss of early visibility on emerging infectious diseases"" and force a Scottish blood expert to come off the EBA's executive board, the paper said.  The Scottish Funding Council (SFC) has been considering possible Brexit effects on EU students, funding and research.  In 2015/16, 22,405 EU nationals studying in Scotland were entitled to Scottish government funding.  A confidential SFC paper from October 2017 assumes that ""equal treatment of Scottish and EU students will cease to apply"" after Brexit.  That, the paper said, would give ministers options including the ""release of around £95m of teaching grant and fees for other Scottish government priorities"".  All EU students starting courses in Scotland in 2019/20 or before will have their tuition fees paid throughout their studies.  Both the Student Awards Agency and the Scottish Qualifications Authority have highlighted the need for greater clarity on the implications of Brexit.  The Scottish government published a paper on the justice and security implications of Brexit in June. It raises concerns about reduced police cooperation through Europol and the potential loss of the European Arrest Warrant.  The UK government hopes to negotiate a new security partnership with the EU, maximising continued cooperation.  But Scottish justice secretary Humza Yousaf said last week that a ""complete lack of any clarity"" from the UK was hampering Brexit preparations. The Scottish Prison Service expects Brexit to change the arrangements for prisoner transfers with EU countries. It has assessed the impact as ""low"" because of the relatively small number of prisoners likely to be affected. The Scottish Courts Service said it was working on a fast-track procedure to remove references to EU law from court rules. Police Scotland has a dedicated team working on Brexit but the force and its governing body the Scottish Police Authority have yet to respond to the BBC's request for further information. Scottish Enterprise has launched a 'Get Set For Brexit' toolkit to help businesses prepare for what it describes as a ""fundamentally new operating environment"".  Skills Development Scotland said it was working with a large textiles employer on a pilot project to identify key questions businesses need to consider.  The Scottish Futures Trust, which arranges funding for infrastructure projects, said it had not made a ""general assessment"" of the likely impact of Brexit.  However, a 2016 paper on the school building programme raised the possibility that leaving the EU could ""exacerbate the skills shortage in the construction industry"".  As 90% of food and feed law stems from EU membership, Food Standards Scotland said it had advised the Scottish government on the changes required to maintain consumer protection.  The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) expects the immediate adjustment to Brexit ""is likely to be straightforward"".  Its longer term concern is the perceived ""risk that UK environmental laws will 'lag behind' those of the rest of Europe"".  Scottish Natural Heritage said it had appointed a full-time EU exit coordinator and was giving priority to updating advice and guidance for the public.  A key concern for local government is future funding.  The UK government has guaranteed to honour EU funding programmes until 2020 but councils are still nervous about the years beyond that.  North Lanarkshire said it had a ""working assumption"" that Brexit would lead to a ""further squeezing of public sector budgets"".  Highland Council said the lack of structural and regional development schemes to replace EU funds was a ""significant risk"" for the area.  Dundee is worried there has been ""no guarantee"" of post-Brexit participation in the Interreg programme which allows exchange of expertise.  Procurement is another important issue with Scottish Borders contemplating ""potential spikes in the cost of goods and services"" in the event of a ""chaotic"" Brexit. A council official has floated the idea of buying £5m worth of steel for a Hawick flood scheme before EU departure to avoid any price volatility.  North Ayrshire said ""potential opportunities from Brexit are much harder to identify and quantify"".  Fife has suggested European twin town relationships could help ""chart a smooth path"" through Brexit.  Major local authorities like Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee have produced detailed reports on Brexit.  Many smaller councils have not, with Inverclyde reporting ""no preparations or assessments have been made"". Ditto Clackmannanshire. Stirling and West Dunbartonshire said they had ""no recorded information"". East Ayrshire provided a ""nil response"".  The local government umbrella body Cosla is carrying out extensive work on behalf of all councils.  A detailed briefing paper by Transport Scotland from March 2018 raises concerns about road haulage to the continent after Brexit.  The document anticipates increased truck checks at the Channel ports, even if there's not a ""physical border"".  It suggests this would cause particular problems for Scottish hauliers who come close to the legal limit for driver hours when travelling from the central belt to Dover or Channel Tunnel.  According to Transport Scotland, ""the impact of any further delay at customs might be more than marginal leading to the need for an overnight stop"" and additional haulage costs.  CMAL - which owns ferries operated by Caledonian MacBrayne and Serco Northlink - said a ""hard Brexit"" could cause a ""breakdown in the supply chain"" and delay future ferry orders.  Highland council said relatively small reductions in air travel, if trade with the EU reduced, could put at risk international routes from Inverness airport.  Visit Scotland's concerns include possible changes to open sky agreements, which ""could adversely affect the ability of visitors to travel to Scotland"".  Historic Environment Scotland has number crunched the impact a post-Brexit recession might have on its revenue and considered how that could be offset by a ticket price increase.  The National Galleries are mindful that ""changes in regulation could bring extra bureaucracy and cost making it more difficult, for example, to mount international exhibitions"".  As well as considering potential Brexit downsides, the National Library sees a possible upside: ""renewed interest in Scottish literature, culture and events to support tourism"" if Scotland's identity is repositioned on the world stage.

Volatility,"Biden says American people 'really, really down'",2024-09-25,2022-06-17,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-61835919,"In a rare interview, President Joe Biden has said Americans are ""really, really down"" as they grapple with soaring inflation after two years of a pandemic. He told the Associated Press the ""need for mental health in America has skyrocketed"". Mr Biden said he wanted Americans to ""be confident. Because I am confident.""  The president's popularity has plunged as November elections loom that will decide which party controls Congress. ""People are really, really down,"" Mr Biden told the news agency in a half-hour interview from the Oval Office on Thursday. ""They're really down. Their need for mental health in America has skyrocketed because people have seen everything upset.  ""Everything they counted on upset. But most of it's a consequence of, of, of what's happening, what happened is a consequence of the, the Covid crisis. ""People lost their jobs. People are out of their jobs. And then, were they going to get back to work? Schools were closed.""  Mr Biden spoke to the news agency amid complaints from members of the White House press corps about their lack of access to him.  Asked about the possibility of the US economy dipping into recession, the Democratic president insisted it was ""not inevitable"".  He also called arguments that his $1.9tn coronavirus aid package had sparked inflation ""bizarre"". Mr Biden had initially discounted warnings from economists that his spending could overheat the economy, before insisting when inflation arrived that it would be ""temporary"", only to acknowledge in recent days that elevated consumer prices will persist ""for a while"". Last month, inflation in the US hit 8.6% - one of the highest rates in the world. During the interview, the AP said Mr Biden became defensive when asked about this issue. ""If it's my fault,"" he said, ""why is it the case in every other major industrial country in the world that inflation is higher? You ask yourself that? I'm not being a wise guy."" A Fox News reporter challenged the White House press secretary about this claim on Thursday, pointing out that inflation is currently lower in other top economies such as Germany, France, Italy, Japan, Canada and India."
Volatility,Investors see bargains in BRICs,2024-09-25,2014-11-03,Constance Gustke,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20130906-investors-tiptoeing-into-brics,"Where some see dross, others spy gold. Case in point: BRICs. BRICs — primarily Brazil, Russia, India and China — comprise some of the largest and most-developed global emerging markets, not fared well overall this year. But they are once again being considered by investors as they take a closer look at some battered, and possibly bargain-priced, stocks. Overall, many investors have been fleeing emerging markets. For the first seven months of the year, emerging market equity funds had a net outflow of $4.5 billion, as global investors scurried back to the US and Europe, lured by the idea that US interest rates could rise — a boon to investment returns — if the Federal Reserve winds down its long-running stimulus program, as widely expected. But the decline among emerging markets stocks may be leaving some golden buying opportunities, say some experts, especially among the BRICs. Those powerhouse economies, including the core four BRIC countries, have strong fundamentals that can insulate them from some of the broader volatility. Those fundamentals include a large and expanding middle class and increasingly sophisticated, acquisition-minded companies. They also have strong gross domestic production (GDP), the measure of the value of goods and services produced within the country’s borders.  Overall, measured by purchasing-price-parity adjusted GDP, emerging markets will create $1.6 trillion more goods and services than advanced markets in 2013, according to the International Monetary Fund. “Cheap” A recent JP Morgan Asset Management emerging market research report noted that BRIC stocks currently look quite “cheap,” as country valuations hover near the bottom end of historical valuation ranges. All four BRIC countries will have higher GDP growth than the US this year, according to JP Morgan. China and Russia have relatively low debt, 31% and 12%, respectively. And China’s ample international reserves total nearly $3.5 trillion. Both countries’ GDPs are also growing: China’s growth will hit 8% this year, Russia’s 3.4%. Though there’s no sign of a comeback yet — for the first seven months of this year, the MSCI BRIC Index has plummeted 11.21% — some investors and big emerging market mutual funds, like ones run by T Rowe Price, are bargain hunting. “We accept some risk in short-term pain,” said Todd Henry, emerging market equity portfolio specialist at Maryland-based T Rowe Price. “But opportunity is there in growth.” BRIC stocks make up nearly 50% of The T Rowe Price Emerging Markets Stock Fund’s $7.2 billion in assets. The fund is adding to its BRIC holdings, especially the Russian and Indian stock allocations. Chinese stocks also don’t look expensive right now, Henry said. In late August, the MSCI China Index price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) — a measure of how expensive a stock is — was only 9.75, versus 11.90 for emerging markets. Currently, the fund favours environmental companies such as wind producer China Longyuan Power Group Corp Ltd and gas company Beijing Enterprises. Despite India’s plummeting rupee, the country is also high on some investors emerging market stock lists. “India is becoming a huge buying opportunity,” said Peter Kohli, president of Pennsylvania-based DMS Funds. “The stock market is just taking a breather, but it will come back again.” The reason, he added, is that India has about 10 years of above-average growth left, partly driven by a huge, acquisition-minded middle class. Indian multinational companies such as Tata Group, Wipro Ltd and Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd will have strong earnings, he said. A depreciated rupee means these companies are now on sale for emerging market investors, he added. Who should invest? Bedevilled by wild swings, emerging markets are typically best as part of well-diversified portfolios, or for value-hungry investors with reasonably long investment horizons. The small sizes of most emerging market economies mean they are vulnerable to the vagaries of global investors. “In the past, these huge investor inflows have helped prop up countries like Thailand and Vietnam,” said Jonathan Galaviz, a managing director at the Nevada-based strategy and research consultancy Galaviz & Co. “For this reason, economies in Asia have been over-heating for the past five years.” That is beginning to change. For instance, Thailand’s GDP growth is expected to slow to 4.2% in 2014 from 5.9% this year. Unlike smaller emerging markets, BRICs benefit from being big, diversified economies with highly liquid markets. Even so, they’re best played by using ETFs, say many experts. There are several BRIC ETFs to choose from, including country-specific ones like Market Vectors Russia ETF or the iShares MSCI India Small-Cap ETF. Alan Miller, chief investment officer at the London-based investment management firm SCM Private, also prefers ETFs. A contrarian investor, he is eyeballing investments in emerging market BRICs like Russia. One reason: The MSCI Russia Index P/E is only 5. “Yet Russia’s earnings growth isn’t falling off a cliff,” he added. Some other emerging market experts are looking further afield. Philippe Carre, global head of connectivity for SunGard’s Global Trading Business, says that some Eastern Europe countries, especially Poland and Rumania, are becoming star performers. These post-Soviet countries are seeing their exchanges grow, as more companies are listed. Yet even Carre isn’t immune to the lures of some of the BRICs. “It’s hard to avoid economic locomotives like China,” he said."
Volatility,Ambitious Aussies take the wheel,2024-09-25,2016-01-05,Phil Mercer,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20151222-meet-australias-new-go-it-alone-investors,"It’s not for the faint-hearted, going solo with your life savings. But in search of a more prosperous retirement, that’s exactly what two million Australians have decided to do. They’ve taken matters in to their own hands, ditching traditional professional investment services in favour of (either completely or partially) running their pension plans by themselves. They’re hoping to hit the jackpot: a comfortable retirement. To be sure, taking this kind of risk may offer big rewards but the downside can be devastating. There’s some indication that what’s happening down under could be the start of a wider global trend for self-directed retirement savings. Government measures, known as “pension freedoms” came into force in Britain in April 2015 giving individual a lot more control over their retirement cash.   The number of go-it-alone investors in Australia has been climbing over the last decade, according to Lisa Greig, from Taxpayers Australia, a nonprofit organisation representing tax accountants and small businesses. Official statistics show self-managed funds now account for almost a third of all superannuation, or pension, nest-eggs in Australia. A decade ago that figure stood at just 10%. The reason? Australia’s ageing population and rising living costs are putting huge pressure on household budgets, (as people live longer lives they still need to accumulate enough savings to pay for food, utilities, insurance.) In addition, more Australians want a greater say in how their finances are managed. These self-funded retirees believe they can get better returns by spreading their money between assets such as property, debentures (debt products issued by large firms) vintage cars or even fine art, in addition to stocks. Large pension funds don’t offer investors this breadth of investments and often rely more heavily on equities performance to generate returns. While the majority of Australians trust their retirement income to funds run by specific companies or industries (education and health care account for 19% of the superannuation market), or retail funds managed by financial institutions or the insurance sector (around 28% of all superannuation), doing it yourself is clearly not for everyone. Those taking the plunge must be financially literate and willing to do their research, Greig said. “It comes down to the effort you want to put in,” she explained. “You’ve got to put the training in if you want to run a marathon, well, you’ve got to put the training in if you want to get the right result from your self-managed superannuation fund. The buck stops with you so you’ve got to take that responsibility.” Tim Harcourt, an economist at the University of New South Wales Business School said, “The main pitfall is you have to do the administration yourself and be more vigilant in watching the markets — instead of sitting back and letting the professionals do it for you. It’s not necessarily more risky — self-managed super funds (SMSF) have been performing well compared to industry and retail funds but you have to be engaged and have a good grasp of financial information to be successful.” Pensions deconstructed Australia has various provisions for those approaching old age. Most people over the age of 65 are entitled to an age-pension, which is means-tested and they don’t have to contribute to. Designed as a measure to prevent poverty, about a quarter of retirees aren’t eligible to receive the benefit because they are too wealthy. In 1990 Australia introduced a compulsory pre-funded pension plan called superannuation, a scheme that employers must pay in to on behalf of their workers. Those contributions currently equate to 9.5% of an employee’s wage, this will likely rise to near 12% by July 2025. The scheme was created by the government to provide the country’s ageing and longer-living population with a decent income in retirement. It’s a similar structure to schemes run in Chile and Sweden. Compulsory superannuation, introduced more than 25 years ago, has thrown up new challenges for retirees. Never before have so many older Australians had the opportunity to shape their financial futures. Since the compulsory system came into effect the superannuation industry has amassed funds worth more than A$1tn (US$717.8bn), and laws allowing self-managed funds handed over power to Australians that previous generations never had. In their own hands These self-funded retirees say caution is key and a clear long-term strategy and an aversion to unnecessary risk are crucial. A sense of calm is needed, too. Arnie Bates, who migrated from Britain in 1985, said it has been important to learn not to panic. “You must not be too nervous when things go the wrong way in the market,” Bates said. “Yeah, you win some, you lose some. On average we are ahead but at the moment to make more than the cost of living is very, very hard and it is pushing a lot of retirees into risky investments, unfortunately.” Bates, in his late 60s, retired after a long career in the textile, footwear and clothing industry in 2011. It was a five-year stint working in Indonesia that convinced him that he had the knowledge and confidence to take control of his money in retirement. Bates said he holds at least two year’s worth of living expenses in cash to weather downturns in the stock market. Not everyone is so fortunate or so savvy. For those who want to learn more about investing, the Australian Tax Office offers advice to retirees, while information services such as the Eureka Report and professional financial advisers offer guidance. The risks For many investors, the thought of handling their own finances may fill them with fear. “The real risk is people taking control of their [superannuation] funds without any formal or appropriate advice, and thinking they know a little bit about everything, which is dangerous,” explained Jason Sourasis, managing director of Strategic Financial group, which encourages self-managed portfolios for Australians with funds only in excess of A$500,000 (US$360,000). In Australia, many retirees who go solo with their finances hand-pick an advisor to help them navigate through a complex maze of regulations and rules, and tax legislation that can be hard for outsiders to follow. “A lot of people probably take [on] too much risk at the wrong times not knowing anything about the investment markets or the volatility that comes with different asset classes,” Sourasis told BBC Capital. Professor John Piggott from the University of New South Wales Business School worries that some self-funded retirees might find themselves out of their depth. “It is not a responsibility that previous generations have faced. That contributes to its lack of familiarity amongst people of this age and its scariness.  It leads to a lot of apprehension and, in some cases, very poor decision-making,” he said. Successes and failures Neville Daynes, a former school principal in Melbourne, says his portfolio, which comprises cash accounts, property and shares, incurs accounting and audit costs of less than 1%, well below the 2.5% charged by larger institutions. Daynes says he is organised and stays on top of his paperwork.  Like fellow retiree Arnie Bates, he takes a cautious approach and says he never holds more than 5% of his portfolio in any one share or investment. “There were a couple of times when I got hit during the credit squeeze …,” said Daynes. “It takes quite a bit of work and you have to work on a strategy, so it is not for everybody.” Though taking the driving seat is an increasing popular approach to retirement planning, there are horror stories. A decade ago, Kerry Koliadis, an immigrant from Greece, retired after a 44-year career in the cardboard-box making industry. After seeing friends and colleagues lose money in the stock market, the 74-year old retiree from Sydney ploughed most of his retirement money into the local taxi industry, buying licences that allow him to run taxi services. Koliadis said competition from ride sharing service Uber has had a catastrophic effect.  “I bought three taxi licences for approximately A$250,000 (US$179,000) each but now the price has dropped by more than A$100,000 (US$72,000) each,” he explained. “This is not the right thing for somebody in retirement to face, and I say my prayers, my friend.” To comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Capital, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter."
Volatility,Twitter pop? Know this about IPOs,2024-09-25,2014-11-03,Constance Gustke,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20131106-pop-goes-the-ipo-or-does-it,"The eagerly anticipated Twitter initial public offering debuts on the New York Stock Exchange Thursday.  Amid excitement and demand for the shares, the social network has already boosted its estimate of the shares’ value by 25% — a signal to some that IPOs are again heating up in the United States as investors look for fresh, potentially high-growth stocks.     According to real-time information provider Dealogic, 190 IPOs have listed on US stock markets so far this year and most saw their share price rise on the first day of trading. Container Store shares, for instance, rose 101% the day they began trading 1 November. IPOs in Europe, mainly in the UK, have also been strong as markets there rebound. Royal Mail, a UK postal service company, rose 38% on the first day of trading on the London Stock Exchange, although most first-day pops among European IPO stocks are more muted. “Everyone is trying to find the next great IPO performer,” says Jim Krapfel, an equity strategist at investment research firm Morningstar.  “When people clamour for company shares, though, the deal is more likely overhyped.”  That’s one big reason why experts say it is often better for average investors to avoid the siren call of the next hot IPO — at least at the start. What’s more, big institutional investors may get the bulk of the available shares for popular offerings and have access to more up-to-date financial information than do individual investors. Buying a first-day IPO can be fool’s gold, say some experts, since many fall after a brief rise. Prosensa Holding NV, a Dutch biotech company, popped 48% its first day on the Nasdaq exchange in late June. Since then, the company’s shares have dropped 72%, according to Dealogic data. “IPOs are meant to pop the first day,” explained John Edmunds, a professor of finance at Babson College in Massachusetts. The danger, though, is that a fast start means that future growth is already priced into the stock and investors who buy early on may end up seeing their sure thing turn into a disappointment. Wait and see Part of the IPO allure is getting in on the ground floor of owning a company. The day an IPO starts trading, investors are finally able to buy stock in companies that have usually been held only by private investors. Those private investors have often invested tens of millions in the fledging firm but don’t usually like to have their money tied up forever. Plus, they want to rake in the profits they’ve been waiting for. Most IPOs allow those early investors — and employees who are granted shares before the IPO as incentive or compensation — to sell their stock after a few months. When they do, it almost always drags down the price of the stock because so many shares are coming into the open market at once, according to Robert Emens, a principal at GW & Wade Asset Management Company in Palo Alto, California. “In reality, you’re coming in on something like the fifth floor,” explained Brian Hamilton, chairman of Sageworks, which analyses private company financials. “Other parties have almost always invested earlier at lower prices. You could be late to the party.” If you’re really keen on owning a stock, “wait to buy when others aren’t looking”, said Krapfel. That is usually at least 25 days after an offering is listed.    Behind the curtain Gauging a company’s true, non-hyped IPO value can be hard to do. Newly public companies lack a long-term track record of revenue or profits, and have no analyst ratings to help investors compare the firm to any benchmark. Huge, hotly-anticipated offerings of big names like Facebook — and even Twitter — are more likely to be significantly overpriced compared to the actual value of the firm more than some other IPOs, Edmunds said. Coltish IPOs are also more volatile during the first two years they’re listed. “IPOs can also get slammed 30% in one day,” said William Smith, chief executive officer at Renaissance Capital in Greenwich, Connecticut. That high volatility can impact future performance. According to a study by the University of Florida, IPOs issued between 2000 and 2011 underperformed similar firms by 18% the first year and 6.3% the second. Five years later, however, that gap was nearly erased as the firms became more established and built a smoother track record.  Despite the early price pop effect, today’s IPOs are still better quality — sporting better revenues and stronger profits — than companies that debuted during the dot-com era. “Back then, there was a feeding frenzy,” said Edmunds. Several company IPOs rose over 100% their first day of trading, and some didn’t even have positive cash flow at their IPO. That’s also the case with Twitter, which is one reason experts say investors should be cautious. These days, investors are counselled to look for two essential IPO ingredients: revenue growth and profitability.  These ingredients help buoy an IPO’s stock price after the early excitement wears off. For example, Chipotle Mexican Grill, which was profitable before going public in 2006, is now trading at $543 per share. Its stock debuted at $22 per share.    Remember, the stock market punishes companies — even big, exciting, next-best-thing ones — if they can’t sustain or produce earnings. When couponer Groupon went public in 2011, it wasn’t profitable and still isn’t. Shares now hover 50% below their offering price, said Hamilton. As for Twitter, the company isn’t making money and recent reports about the decline in the number of new users worries onlookers. “Growth might be slowing,” said Edmunds. “So what are investors really being offered?” Edmunds asked.

Volatility,The CEOs of tomorrow,2024-09-25,2013-10-18,Unknown,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20131017-the-ceos-of-tomorrow,"What does US National Football League star quarterback Peyton Manning have in common with the best chief executives of today and the future? Is it intelligence? The ability to command a room? To think fast on his feet? It may be all of the above. What it takes to be a leader — and what future executive suites may look like — was a topic several LinkedIn Influencers weighed in on this week, from quarterback-as-CEO to the end of the white, male executive to the future of women in the upper echelons of corporations. Here is what some of them had to say. Gary Burnison, Chief Executive Officer at Korn/Ferry International Peyton Manning, quarterback for the NFL’s Denver Broncos has been “flawless so far this season. He and his team find a way to win,” wrote Burnison in his post Peyton Manning Would Make an Even Better CEO. His stats speak for themselves: He has thrown 20 touchdowns in the five games that have been played this season and has a 150-70 win-loss record over his 15 seasons of play. “At any leadership level, like President, CEO, or sports figure — the great leaders rise above and represent the team more than themselves. Leaders demonstrate that they are in charge and in control. And part of being in charge is their belief they will overcome the odds and win — and they do,” Burnison wrote.  “Much of this is driven by their aura of confidence, a presence that permeates the culture. This is apparent in Peyton Manning’s deep belief that he and his team will make it.” So what might Manning look like as a CEO? “In running a business, he would have the company ahead of projections month after month. He would anticipate issues and adjust the company to a changing environment — like calling an audible at the line of scrimmage,” Burnison wrote. Manning has one characteristic in particular which is becoming increasingly important for leaders. That trait is “learning agility”. “Learning agility is the willingness and ability to learn from experience and then apply those lessons to succeed in new situations,” wrote Burnison. “Leaders who are learning agile continuously seek new challenges, solicit direct feedback, self-reflect, and get jobs done resourcefully.” Steve Tappin, Chief Executive Officer at Xinfu, host of BBC CEO Guru Are the days of the white male chief executive coming to an end? That’s the question Tappin addressed in his post End of Days For White, Male, Stale CEOs? His answer: a resounding yes. “We are about to witness an unprecedented leadership shift over the next decade,” Tappin wrote. “Expect a transformation: the two-thirds of Western CEOs who are really professional managers — incrementally optimising their companies around the short-term — will go. They’ll be leapfrogged by a new breed of CEOs running on an emerging market fuel, powered by dreams, entrepreneurship, innovation and belief.” One need only look at market predictions about global companies to get a sense of why, he wrote. “According to a new report from McKinsey Global Institute, Urban World: The Shifting Global Business Landscape, an amazing 70% of the predicted 88% growth in large companies between now and 2025 will come from the emerging markets.” “Where will future leaders come from, and what will this mean for the white, male-dominated elite currently running the show in America and Europe?,” asked Tappin. “I believe that we will see a rise of global entrepreneurs building sustainable value.”   Where will these new CEOs come from? Tappin pointed to the BRICs — the block of emerging market countries comprised of Brazil, Russia, India and China. “The BRIC countries all have their challenges, but they could be set to turn these to their advantage. Their entrepreneurs are more likely to have suffered hardship in their upbringing, and don’t underestimate their driving determination to secure a legacy for their families, future generations and their country,” he wrote.  “Their companies are often younger, and a stronger family orientation can mean that, like the South Koreans and Japanese who rose before them, they are able to set their time horizon over the longer term.” Sallie Krawcheck, former head of Merrill Lynch and Smith Barney With her investment in women’s networking group 85 Broads, Krawcheck has become outspoken on the lack of women in executive and board roles. Now, she wrote in her post What Winning Companies Get… And Others Won’t, “We are in a bull market for advice to women on how to get ahead in their companies.” “Smart companies…are recognising that the inherent differences among genders and cultures are not things to be fixed, but are instead sources of strength. It is exactly these differences that drive the higher returns, lower volatility and greater innovation that accrue to more diverse companies,” Krawcheck wrote. What will this look like? Krawcheck wrote that “smart companies will embrace and draw on these differences… They will change their evaluation systems to eliminate “cascading bias,” in which the qualities of the existing (typically white, male) leadership team are reinforced and other types of skills are undervalued.” By doing this, more women will reach higher levels and executive roles. “It won’t happen quickly. But companies that don’t take this action will increasingly lose out,” Krawcheck wrote.

Volatility,Why parenting is so scary now,2024-09-25,2021-12-16,Kate Morgan,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20211215-is-parenting-scarier-than-ever,"In an uncertain world, young people are grappling with the question: to have children or not? When 37-year-old Heather Marcoux was expecting her son several years ago, she and her husband assumed it’d be the first of multiple pregnancies. “We certainly thought we’d have more than one,” says Marcoux, who lives in Alberta, Canada. But today, the parents are very clear that their now-primary-school-aged son will never have a sibling. “We can offer our one child a pretty good standard of living,” she says. “But if we added any more kids, it would go down significantly.”  It’s in part a financial decision; even with Marcoux and her husband’s incomes combined, childcare is a struggle, and saving in any significant way is impossible. But it also has to do with a lack of support and doubt about the future. “I feel like another child would be a burden we just could not handle,” says Marcoux. “Nobody wants to think of their growing family as a burden. That’s messed up to even say. But some days we just think it feels so impossible what we’re trying to do with one. How could we make [our day-to-day lives] work with more? Some family members are disappointed by our choice, but the world is just different now.”  The global birth rate is falling. That’s not necessarily news; it’s been on the decline since 1950, according to data collected by Washington, DC-based non-profit Population Reference Bureau. But the decline in more recent years has been especially stark: in 2021, the global fertility rate is 2.3 births per woman; in 1990, it was 3.2. A new Pew Research Center survey found that a growing percentage of childless US adults ages 18 to 49 intend to remain that way. In every single European nation, fertility in 2021 was below the 2.1 births per woman generally considered the “rate of replacement” for a population. In a number of those countries, birth rates hit record lows. It’s not hard to imagine why young people are hesitating to have large families. Financial stability is more difficult to achieve than ever. One in 10 non-retired Americans say their finances may never recover from the pandemic, and significant inflation could be looming in Europe. In many places, home ownership is all but a pipe dream. Political and civil unrest is rampant across the world, and climate is in crisis. It’s easy to adopt a dismal view of the future. “The central explanation is the rise of uncertainty,” Daniele Vignoli, professor of demography at the University of Florence, said in his keynote address at a research workshop hosted on Zoom by the European University Institute. “The increasing speed, dynamics and volatility” of change on numerous fronts, he explains, “make it increasingly difficult for individuals to predict their future”. And while the global unemployment rate rebounded post-recession, it hasn’t rebounded evenly across industries and levels. “There’s been a decline of good jobs for people in lower and middle-income households – union jobs, construction, manufacturing – those jobs were not coming back, and they’re stable, good jobs for people with lower levels of education,” says Gemmill. A 2019 US study showed the loss of certain jobs, including manufacturing, had a greater impact than overall unemployment on total fertility rate. Gemmill adds the rise of gig work and shift work – jobs that don’t generally come with family benefits, like childcare or healthcare in privatised countries – also creates questions around future stability, and influences decision-making around parenting. And economic uncertainty extends past employment, to housing uncertainty. A recent study by researchers at the Centre for Population Change at the University of Southampton, UK, showed the usual assumption that people would own a home before having children – one that was backed up by data until about 2012 – no longer holds true. In fact, financial realities may now mean young people have to choose between owning a home or having one or more children. “This disconnection between owning a home and becoming a parent has significant implications for parenthood in general,” said lead researcher Professor Ann Berrington in a press release. “If it is the case, as we propose, that homeownership is increasingly competing with the costs of having children, then it is likely that those who do manage to buy a home might well postpone or even forego having children.”  Marcoux says the pressures of paying a mortgage and maintaining a home are part of the reason she won’t have more children. It’s scary, she says, to think that something catastrophic could happen and throw the family into financial crisis. On top of that, adds Marcoux, she worries that she isn’t providing enough for her son. ‘Community has really eroded’ For would-be parents, these financial concerns can be compounded by worries over political and civil unrest, both local and global – fears that can be further exacerbated by the constant presence of media in our lives, which can amplify conflict and division. And while wars and political issues have been a reality for nearly every generation, everywhere, parents today arguably face a world that seems much scarier than that of their own parents or grandparents. Despite higher-than-ever life expectancy, improved technology and access to modern healthcare, omnipresent media means we’re more hyper-aware of all the world’s terrifying goings-on, from food shortages to school shootings. Data from the most recent Global Peace Index, an annual report compiled by the Sydney-based Institute for Economics & Peace, shows civil unrest has more than doubled in the world over the past decade, with a significant spike in 2020 alone, when it increased globally by 10%. Forty years of data across nations that experienced civil conflict shows fertility rates typically fall by up to one-third during periods of instability. People have fewer children, says Gemmill, when they’re terrified by what their progeny might have to contend with. Marcoux also feels divisiveness impacts people at the neighbourhood level, too. There’s a lack of community, she says, that makes parenting a lot harder – and lonelier – than it used to be. “When I was a kid in the early 1990s, all the moms on the block were stay-at-home-moms. Everybody was always around, you knew your neighbours and you had community support,” she says.   Family Tree This story is part of BBC's Family Tree series, which examines the issues and opportunities parents, children and families face today – and how they'll shape the world tomorrow. Find more on BBC Future. Marcoux says she doesn’t feel that support, and being isolated in her own community adds to the fears of modern parenting. In one 2018 study, two-thirds of US millennials surveyed reported feeling disconnected from their communities – unfortunate findings, considering social ties are one of the strongest predictors of happiness. “We don’t even know our neighbours. I think community has really eroded,” says Marcoux. “And now, especially, the political issues are really coming to the fore and some people are losing relationships with people we might’ve counted on in the past, because our beliefs, morals and ethics are just not compatible.” A climate of uncertainty In the Pew Research survey, when people who said they were unlikely to have children in the future were asked why, 5% cited environmental reasons. A 2019 poll by Business Insider showed close to a third of Americans, including nearly 40% of those aged 18 to 29, thought couples should “consider the negative effects of climate change when deciding whether or not to have children”. It's not just that a growing population increases humanity’s carbon footprint. Marcoux says she fears the next generation will suffer with the worst effects of climate change, and she worries about the version of the Earth her child and potential grandchildren will inherit.  She says the climate crisis only reinforces her choice to keep her son an only child. “Why would I bring another child into the mix when I sometimes think about the future and am just terrified for him? I do lay awake at night thinking about what his future will be like,” she says. “This is another thing my husband and I talk about nonstop. He wonders, did we make the right choice? Are we burdening our child with having to deal with the consequences? Were we being selfish?” They’re questions plaguing entire generations as they decide how many children to have, or whether to have any at all, in the face of increasingly desperate reports about the state of the planet. “It didn't occur to me that the climate’s tipping point might present itself during my own ovarian prime time,” writes Sierra adventure editor Katie O’Reilly in a 2019 piece for the magazine about grappling with the choice to pursue motherhood as an environmental journalist in the era of climate crisis. “It's become impossible to ignore the fact that things are looking increasingly grim for my generation's offspring. How could I look my hypothetical child in the eye and acknowledge that I willingly brought them into a chaotic, increasingly uninhabitable world, that I knew all their favourite picture-book animals were going extinct?” An uncertain optimism  As I write this, my own first child squirms and hiccups inside me. I’ve had a blessedly uncomplicated pregnancy, physically speaking, but mentally and emotionally, I’m knee-deep in murky, mixed-up feelings about impending parenthood. I thought that, at 31, I’d be in a different place financially. My student loans aren’t paid off, and, barring major legislative action, I’ll likely keep carrying them around until my kid is in kindergarten, at least. I live in rural Pennsylvania, US, where the cost of living is low and I have easy access to healthy, affordable local food. But my home is rented, I’m far from my family, and while I have a loving community of neighbours, it’s tough to shake the feeling of impermanence. I am anxious about birthing a child into a pandemic, and into a country where the political peace feels – to me – tenuous. I am anxious about so many things. Overpowering the fear is a deep, visceral excitement and an unmistakable optimism. I can’t wait to walk with my child in the natural world, battered though it may be, pointing out the preciousness of the Appalachian hardwood trees and the moths and mussels, and the deep snow on the ski hill.  I tell myself we’ll simply do our best to familiarise – not scare – our baby with the world’s problems, and then empower them to believe they can help right the ship. Parenthood is terrifying, but feels like exactly the right choice for me. Somehow, it seems, both things can be true."
Volatility,Electricity and sewerage bills rise with inflation,2024-09-25,2023-12-13,By Alex Blake,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-isle-of-man-67703434,"Electricity, sewerage and water bills are to rise in line with inflation on the Isle of Man, the chairman of Manx Utilities has confirmed. It follows Tynwald's backing of the firm's five-year pricing strategy being extended for a further 12 months.  The 5.7% inflationary rise in the sewerage rate from 1 April was also approved by politicians. Chairman John Wannenburgh said the rises were ""vital"" to enable investment in the services provided. The changes will see an average increase of £70 for electricity bills and £21 in the water rate for households each year. Those rises would generate an additional £5.6m and £1.1m in revenue for the government-owned utilities provider. The sewerage rate rise, which would be about £19 annually, was expected to raise another £800,000 in revenue, Mr Wannenburgh said. Manx Utilities set out its intention to implement that hike last month. For those with a septic tank, the cost of having it emptied is set to rise by £75 to £225. While Tynwald members voted to accept the increases, some MHKs expressed unease about them. Michelle Haywood said she was ""really uncomfortable"" basing utilities prices on a strategy from 2018, before major world events including the coronavirus pandemic and war in Ukraine had produced a ""seismic shift in the energy supply markets"".  A review of the authority's current pricing strategy, agreed by Tynwald in 2018, had been due to be completed by the start of the 2024-25 financial year.  But Mr Wannenburgh said it had been delayed due to the ""remaining volatility in wholesale markets"", and the extra time would allow for ""further stabilisation"" and any future reduction in costs. He said he and his predecessors had worked to ""shield"" Manx customers from the ""full increase in costs it has been facing from the energy crisis"".

Volatility,China’s wine hangover,2024-09-25,2014-02-20,Rob Budden,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20140220-chinas-wine-hangover,"Understanding wine funds There are around a dozen or so specialist wine funds worldwide which can be bought and sold through brokers or direct. You’ll pay a one-off subscription charge of around 5% and funds charge annual management fees — typically between 1.5% and 2% of your total investment― for access. Some funds also charge performance fees of about 20% of any gains above a set return, typically 6% per annum. While a fund diversifies the investments in types of wine, which can lower volatility, some risks remain. Some funds, most notably the Vintage Wine fund in the Cayman Islands, have been forced to close down after a spate of redemptions by investors. This fund peaked at over 100m euro ($137 m) and was invested heavily in Burgundy wines but is now liquidating its portfolio. Funds that adopt an open-ended structure, which means the fund's size expands or contracts depending on whether investors are buying or selling, are most at risk. Rapid sales by investors can shrink the fund so much that annual management charges no longer cover the fixed costs of running the fund.  Is 2014 the year wine merchants and investors are finally able to snap up bargain bottles of excellent vintages? It’s a question many are asking after what wine market experts describe as a clear plateau for prices. Fine wine prices are still reeling from Chinese buyers souring on the market. Those buyers and others across southeast Asia helped lift prices to record highs back in late 2008. But since then, the market has experienced its toughest period on record, with traded prices―typically cases of wine― falling for a third consecutive year. According to London-based data analysis firm, Liv-ex, which tracks wine prices for professional investors around the globe, the market fell 15% in 2011, followed by a 9% decline in 2012. Although in 2013, the market saw only a 1.4% dip. The fine wine market, estimated to be worth several billion dollars annually, remains dominated by the big household names ―Bordeaux, Burgundy and Champagne― and attracts both drinkers and investors. Indeed wine analysts say how important both consumption and investment demand are in driving prices up or down. While the attractions for consumers are obvious, what draws investors in to the sector are a history of double digit returns and another way of diversifying their investments. Chateau Lafite Rothschild was the poster child of this China boom with even “poor vintages” soaring to around £8,000 ($13,000) a case from around £2,500 ($4,125) before the Chinese started entering the market in 2008, according to Justin Gibbs, co-founder of Liv-ex. Prices paid by an investor today for similar vintages have now settled back to around £5,000 ($8,250) a case, he said. Even so, over the last 30 years wine has produced 12% compound annual returns according to Liv-ex. “Ultimately wine is a play on global growth,” said Gibbs. “As people get richer they consume more fine wine.” With global wealth generally on the rise, wine analysts expect prices to resume their upward trend later in 2014. Even so, that trend will be fuelled not by Chinese investors. Few expect the Chinese to return in their droves – many stopped buying in mid 2011 put off by a proliferation of fake wines filtering through to the market and the beginnings of a crackdown on giving wine as corporate gifts by a new government. Wine experts say the next big buyers of fine wine will likely come from India, Africa or possibly even South America. In previous decades, when major regions entered the fine wine market it led to a bull-run for prices. Buyers from the United States in the 1960s and '70s helped send prices up around six-fold in the 15 years to 1975.And from the beginning of the 1990s to the peak of the market in October 1997, buyers from Japan helped usher in more dramatic price increases of around 24%annually. Buying smart There are two primary ways of investing in wine: buying actual cases or bottles and storing them until sale or simply putting money into wine funds. Fine wine expert Matthew Tipping of London-based wine merchant Berry Brothers and Rudd said investors who buy wine directly should ensure that it is stored professionally to maintain its value (you will pay, typically, £12 to £15 or $20 to $25 per year, to store a case). Look for a wine merchant with a long history and ensure the wine is stored in your own name, offering protection for the investment should the merchant go bust. Tipping also recommends buying and holding full cases; selling individual bottles can significantly reduce value. Also, keep in mind you will also incur transaction costs (private buyers will typically face spreads of 10% to15% on sought after wine cases, even higher on less mainstream stock). The main exit routes for investors are selling via auction or through a merchant or wine broker. For those looking to buy wine to store and later sell, the key is choosing the right region, maturity, vintage and wine grower, according to wine fund managers and analysts. Wine funds can offer the advantage that they allow people with more modest sums to invest a greater diversification across vintages, regions and growers and hence less volatile performance. These investors also gain access to an investment professional who is constantly monitoring prices and selecting wines they hope will outperform the wider market. Tipping, of Berry Brothers — which has traded wine since 1698 — said that 18 months ago, around 90% of the investing and trading market was purely in Bordeaux wines. The remainder was made up largely of Champagnes, Burgundies and so-called 'Super Tuscans', a label for more forward thinking wines from the Chianti region, said Tipping, which means the producers adopt more flexible rules for blending wine varieties and grapes. Today Bordeaux trading has fallen to just 78% of the entire market for trading as investors have switched to other varieties such as Burgundy, according to Liv-ex. This is an unusually low figure and has seen Bordeaux prices sink 30% from their peak in June 2011. Some wine investors, however, predict this year could see Bordeaux return to favour, opening an opportunity for savvy buyers. This type of volatility is problematic, though, for the average investor, and highlights the risks of wine investing in the medium term, although many wine experts continue to extol the virtues of the asset class as a longer-term diversification tool for conventional share and bond investment portfolios. Over shorter periods of two to three years or less, wine as an asset class displays remarkable correlation with stock markets according to Liv-ex's Gibbs. Since 2011, fine wines have closely tracked the Shanghai Composite index for example, China's main equity benchmark, Gibbs added. While wine has displayed an even closer correlation with Japanese equities, said Chris Smith, investment manager at the London-based Wine Investment fund, which holds around $50m of stock. Since 2008, wine prices have closely tracked Japan's Nikkei stock market index, he said, with only small signs of diversion over the last year. This close correlation may be a sign of the country's continued influence on the fine wine market globally. After the UK, Japan remains one of the biggest buyers of fine wines in the world and Tokyo has more Michelin-starred restaurants than London, Paris and New York combined, Smith said. Some investors are betting that quantitative easing initiatives in the UK, US and Japan, will herald a return to inflation and could also impact wine pricing. They believe global markets are yet to feel the full force of the extra dollars pumping extra liquidity in to the economy which could lead to a delayed reaction and the return of inflation. At which point inflation-busting asset classes such as gold – and wine – would likely return to favour. While a nightmare for central bankers, this scenario would likely favour fine wines “starting investors looking to inflation proof assets,” Smith says. Gibbs of Liv-ex is full of optimism on the wine market, but he said it might take longer for other merchants to feel safe investing in the market in a big way again. Many wine investors are still licking their wounds following the sharp correction experienced over the last few years. Gibbs concedes: “you won't find many optimistic merchants out there”."
Volatility,Is it worth joining the Bitcoin boom?,2024-09-25,2017-09-07,Chris Baraniuk,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20170906-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-latest-bitcoin-boom,"Crypto-currencies are soaring to market highs drawing in new investors – but some experts have concerns about the future. You may have noticed reports about Bitcoin’s value recently – its price is headed into the stratosphere. The crypto-currency’s recent meteoric price rise over the summer has seen one Bitcoin go from being worth $1,500 in early May to more than $5,000 over the weekend, before dropping to $4,654 at the time of publication. And that has got all kinds of people interested – people like Andrew Beckwith, a DJ who goes by the name Supersede. “I play restaurants, lounges, nightclubs, corporate events,” he says. You may also like: - Inside a secret Chinese Bitcoin mine - Loneliness often follows sudden wealth - Turning water into gold But he also invests. Beckwith has just taken his first step into the world of crypto-currencies, having converted $100 into Bitcoin. “I don’t know how far it’s going to grow,” he explains, “but if something is growing at hundreds of per cent, that’s a pretty valuable return.” Bitcoin is notorious for its volatility, but the recent peaks are unprecedented. In late 2013 its value jumped from around $100 to $1,000 – a bigger percentage increase – but it is worth more than four times that today. “Recently there’s been a lot more talk in the media and others have been investing,” explains Kiran Varughese, another amateur investor, who works for an elevator company in Dubai. A friend’s experiments with Bitcoin piqued his curiosity so he clubbed together with another pal to invest $1,000 in August. If they lose it, he says they won’t be too worried – the potential for a big return within the next few years is too tantalising for Varughese to resist. But are investors like Varughese and Beckwith taking too much of a risk by buying into Bitcoin, and other crypto-currencies like Ethereum, Litecoin or Dash? Is there something about these digital currencies that underpins their soaring prices or are they simply subject to whims in the market that can make fortunes but also devastate them? While the market capitalisation of all crypto-currencies now stands at $150 billion, they still occupy a strange space in the world of finance. “Every year Bitcoin continues to exist is something to take note of,” says Garrick Hileman, a research fellow at the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance at the University of Cambridge. “It’s a significant achievement for Bitcoin to have survived the many setbacks and challenges that it has faced.” One of these challenges occurred recently when Bitcoin split in two. It happened after the Bitcoin community became divided over how to allow more transactions to be processed with the currency. Because Bitcoin has no over-arching authority that controls it, any decision to alter the system that underpins it needed to gather enough support from Bitcoin users to go ahead. The system itself is called the blockchain – a huge digital ledger that records every single Bitcoin transaction in history. As computers on the Bitcoin network verify transactions, “blocks” of data are added to the ledger, storing this information. Computers that do this work receive a small sum of bitcoins as a reward – this is the process known as mining. Every single computer on the network has a copy of the blockchain and their copy of it is constantly updated. But until recently, Bitcoin blocks were limited in size to a megabyte every 10 minutes, meaning that the rate at which the blockchain could grow was capped. In early August, a new version of the crypto-currency – Bitcoin Cash – was mined for the first time. Its blocks can be up to eight megabytes in size. Some believe the smooth transition through this “fork” without any technical disasters has contributed to renewed confidence in Bitcoin, in turn helping to pump the price up. One “coin” of Bitcoin Cash is worth less, around $630 today, but that’s up $200 since its inception a month ago. Another fork to upgrade the block size further is expected in November and if successful, it might have a similar impact on Bitcoin’s buoyant price. But “currencies” like Bitcoin aren’t really playing the role of a traditional currency at the moment, says Vili Lehdonvirta, an economic sociologist at the Oxford Internet Institute, which is part of the University of Oxford. “When I called up a restaurant in Helsinki earlier this year to ask if they accept Bitcoin, the response was that they tried it a few years ago, nobody ever used it, and thus they no longer accept it,” he explains. BBC Capital contacted 10 businesses in London that have advertised an ability to accept Bitcoin in the past. Four of them said they had stopped accepting and two that did accept them reported hardly ever processing such payments. Instead, it appears many people are simply speculating on Bitcoin – investing in what is a relatively high-risk asset in the hope of a short-term gain in profit. But lucrative outcomes are by no means guaranteed – and many still think that Bitcoin is just a bubble. In the short-term there may be various reasons why people are buying in while the price is buoyant. Some may like investing in a currency unconnected to nation states, suggests Hileman. It could be seen as good insulation against uncertain political developments that can cause traditional currencies to plummet dramatically – as happened to the British pound in the aftermath of the Brexit vote. Volatile international disputes, such as those involving North Korea, could be driving people to put their money elsewhere. “If you’re in South Korea and you’re concerned about a geopolitical event, do you trade in the US dollar?” asks Hileman. “Maybe that’s not a great idea because the US will be involved, as will China and Japan, so it’s not surprising to see people look for alternative currencies,” he says. Applied cryptography consultant and Bitcoin-watcher Peter Todd says some are also attracted by Bitcoin’s independence for broader political reasons, too. In an uncertain world, people’s financial freedom is sometimes limited by their governments. Take India, which recently tried to curb public investments in gold as this was harming the nation’s economy. Bitcoin is a global entity, no one government can fiddle with it – although there are countries where trading it is illegal. Still, crypto-currencies remain associated with plenty of risks that go beyond their volatility. Many people store their bitcoins in online exchanges and should these be hacked or go bust, which has happened more than once, then the money is often lost forever. With all the technical ups and downs of crypto-currencies – their changes and potential to split into new currencies for example – there is also a significant degree of complexity that can leave less informed investors bewildered. A new area of excitement, known as initial coin offerings (ICOs), are also beginning to worry some experts. ICOs allow owners of crypto-currencies to invest in fledgling companies, with many using Ethereum as their digital coin of choice. However, ICOs have already been associated with a number of scams and hacks, and China just banned them, calling ICOs 'illegal fundraising'. “I think the main thing we’re seeing in ICOs is straight-up fraud,” says Todd. He is concerned about efforts by regulators to clamp down on this because such an approach could backfire and encourage scammers to become more sophisticated. “It’s when things look legit that they get dangerous,” he says, pointing out that a few years ago Bitcoin and other digital tokens had more of a “Wild West” feel to them, which perhaps meant people were less likely to be duped since scams were crude and easy to spot. As more and more investors get involved in crypto-currencies, scams can get slicker and the natural wariness that can keep people cautious may also diminish. Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies are gradually cementing their stated position – providing a radical new alternative to the investment options that existed before them. But there is no certainty as to how this massive experiment will play out. Though when did that ever stop hopeful investors taking a punt?

Volatility,How busyness leads to bad decisions,2024-09-25,2019-12-02,Brigid Schulte,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20191202-how-time-scarcity-makes-us-focus-on-low-value-tasks,"When we’re under pressure our mental bandwidth narrows – and that means we focus on the wrong tasks. So what’s the remedy for unproductive ‘tunnelling’? With offices closed in nations around the world, many of us are grappling with how to stay productive and on task as we work from home. To help provide insight on how to manage this, BBC Worklife is updating some of our most popular productivity stories from our archive. Let’s see if this sounds familiar: You churn through the day at work under deadline pressure, racing to meetings, dashing off emails, feeling busy, purposeful and a little breathless. Yet as the end of the traditional workday draws near, you realise with a sinking feeling that you haven’t even begun the big project you meant to tackle that day. So you bring work home, or decide not to and can’t stop feeling guilty about it. Either way, your work is spilling over into the rest of your life, stealing time and mental bandwidth away from family or rest or fun, and leaving you feeling exhausted and a little resentful. You resolve that tomorrow will be different. But come morning, you inevitably find yourself back on the treadmill of busyness. That’s a pattern Antonia Violante has seen a lot at workplaces she’s been studying in the United States for a project on work-life balance. Behavioural scientists and researchers like her call it “tunnelling”. When we’re stressed and feeling pressed for time, Violante explains, our attention and cognitive bandwidth narrow as if we’re in a tunnel. It can sometimes be a good thing, helping us hyper-focus on our most important work. But tunnelling has a dark side. When we get caught up in a time scarcity trap of busyness, a panicked firefighting mode, we might only have the capacity to focus on the most immediate, often low-value tasks right in front of us rather than the big project or the long-range strategic thinking that would help keep us out of the tunnel in the first place. “We see people end up tunnelling on the wrong thing,” she says. Why email offers false rewards Email certainly falls under that category. To Violante, a senior associate at ideas42, a non-profit firm with offices across the US and in New Delhi that uses behavioural science to solve real-world problems, email is the perfect addictive “attention slot machine”. Our brains are wired for novelty, so we actually love being interrupted with every random ping and ding of a new message. And humans enjoy feeling busy and productive. Combine time scarcity with that pull of novelty and our busyness craving and it’s easy to see how we end up focusing our time and attention on whatever’s right in front of us, which, these days, is email.   Busy-loving humans have such an aversion to idleness, in fact, that one study found people preferred giving themselves electric shocks rather than have nothing to do. “So it’s easy to be swept up trying to keep on top of your email inbox,” Violante says. “It allows us to be busy, which feels good. But it leads to a false reward.” Like mistaking busyness for productivity. To get out of that particular busyness tunnel, Violante suggests experimenting with checking mail on a schedule. That idea, which Violante herself has adopted, is based on research that found smokers given a smoking schedule had greater success quitting than through other methods. The reason, researchers surmised, is that a schedule not only gave people practice and confidence in not smoking, but also broke the link between habitual smoking cues and actually lighting up. A similar idea holds true for email: a 2015 study found that people who check their email on a schedule felt happier and less stressed out than those who checked constantly – which many of us do, spending about five hours a day nosing about our inboxes.   Violante also suggests that teams set communication protocols for when a response is expected and agree to send emails out only during work hours. To preserve mental bandwidth, she recommends an email mindset shift. “It’s not about having, literally, zero emails in your inbox, but having no ambiguity about what’s in there and having a plan for what’s most important to respond to,” she explains. Though she recognises it’s not easy. “Even behavioural scientists have addiction problems with email.” How scarcity shrinks mental bandwidth The concepts of scarcity and tunnelling were first described in behavioural science research on poverty. Anandi Mani, a professor of behavioural economics at the Blavatnik School of Government at Oxford, and her colleagues wanted to understand what led poor people to make bad choices with their money, such as borrowing at high interest rates or playing the lotto, that can keep them trapped in poverty. They studied sugar cane farmers in India, and gave them cognitive tests both when the farmers were flush with money right after harvest and when, months later, money was scarce. The researchers found that scarcity itself created such a tax on mental bandwidth that the farmers’ IQ tests dropped 13 points between flush and scarce times. “There is a direct parallel between scarcity of money and scarcity of time,” Mani says. “With money, we do what’s urgent – we pay this bill, we try to make the budget work, even when we know it’s more important to take time to be a good parent or talk to your mom. At work, it’s the same. We get captured by whatever’s in front of our face, and we don’t give ourselves the space or introspection to think about what might be more meaningful to do.” To step out of the time scarcity tunnel, Mani suggests first becoming aware of how you may be trapped in busyness. If you can, you might try smoothing your workload or spreading it out over time, much like research on how income smoothing helps those with money scarcity better weather financial volatility and keep from falling into episodic poverty. Then work with others to create and enforce group norms around taking breaks – at work, during the week, at the weekend.   “The old rules – you don’t work on the Sabbath – creating forced slack in our schedules, has real value,” Mani says. She herself is experimenting with 15 minutes of meditation every morning. “It’s making me more aware during the day,” she says. “Honestly, this is a topic which pushes me to a lot of soul searching.” Plan your time with greater care Anuj Shah, a professor of behavioural science at the University of Chicago, says scarcity creates its own mindset. His research, in which participants played online games and were either “rich” or “poor” in the number of guesses or attempts allowed, was surprising. Those who were “poor” were actually much more accurate or careful with their resources. But because scarcity narrowed their bandwidth, they were so focused on the current round, they were unable to strategise about the future and made disastrous choices, like borrowing at exorbitant rates, that wound up costing them dearly.   So to keep from tunnelling on the wrong thing or neglecting important tasks that seem less urgent at the moment but will pay greater dividends in the long run, Shah says, people need to recognise that time and bandwidth are limited resources and begin to think of choices around them as trade-offs. For instance, he says, when we look at our calendar six months from now, it often appears wide open and free of all commitments. So we can overcommit ourselves, which can lead to more time scarcity and tunnelling in the future. “But we know that in six months, that week is going to look a lot like this week, which is usually pretty busy,” Shah says. “So you need to think – how would I fit this in this week? What would I have to give up to do it? We need to realise that slack in the future is an illusion.” It’s a practice he follows as well. Shah’s colleague Sendhil Mullainathan suggests thinking about our schedules as less like a pantry that we cram anything and everything into, and more like an art gallery where we intentionally decide what is most important and how to arrange it so that everything fits. He recommends setting alerts to help us remember what’s important when we start to fall into the scarcity trap. “Once we’re short on time, we’re already in a bad situation,” Shah says. “But if we learn to manage the time beforehand, we can keep that from happening in the future.” Brigid Schulte is a journalist, author of Overwhelmed: Work, Love and Play when No One has the Time, and director of the Better Life Lab at New America  "
Volatility,Hinkley Point deal 'risky and expensive',2024-09-25,2017-06-22,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-40372613,"UK government plans for a new £18bn nuclear power station have come under fire from public auditors, who call it ""a risky and expensive project"". The National Audit Office (NAO) said the costs and risks for consumers had not been sufficiently considered. Its report comes nine months after the government granted final approval for the project, which is being financed by the French and Chinese governments. The government said building the plant was an ""important strategic decision"". State-controlled French energy firm EDF is funding two-thirds of the project, which will create more than 25,000 jobs, with China investing the remaining £6bn. Critics of the deal have warned of escalating costs and the implications of allowing nuclear power plants to be built in the UK by foreign governments.  The NAO's report centred on the role of the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) in finalising the deal in 2016. At the time, said the NAO, the department's own value-for-money tests showed ""the economic case for Hinkley Point C was marginal and subject to significant uncertainty"". ""But the department's capacity to take alternative approaches to the deal were limited after it had agreed terms,"" the NAO added. ""The government has increasingly emphasised Hinkley Point C's unquantified strategic benefits, but it has little control over these and no plan yet in place to realise them."" It added that consumers were ""locked in"" to years of paying for the plant. In response to the report, a BEIS spokesperson said building the plant was ""an important strategic decision to ensure that nuclear is part of a diverse energy mix"". The department said the project would provide ""clean, reliable electricity powering six million homes and creating more than 26,000 jobs and apprenticeships in the process"". EDF Energy said the plant ""remains good value for consumers compared with alternative choices"". The firm added:  ""Consumers won't pay a penny until the power station is operating and it is EDF Energy and [China's] CGN who will take the risk and responsibility of delivering it.  ""The project is having a major impact on the UK's industrial capacity, jobs and skills. Relaunching the UK nuclear new build industry at Hinkley Point C will enable costs for future projects, in particular Sizewell C, to be lower."" The Nuclear Industry Association (NIA) said the report showed that the plant was ""competitive with other low-carbon projects"" and that ""alternatives would cost more"". However, NIA chief executive Tom Greatrex added: ""The NAO analysis of the strike price also highlights that using a different financing structure could have resulted in a lower strike price. ""That is something government should reflect on as other new nuclear projects advance."" Speaking to the BBC, Mr Greatrex said: ""With two-thirds of our capacity coming to the end of its life by 2030, we need to replace that, we need to do that in as low-carbon a way as possible, we need to do that in a way where we're not overly exposed to the volatility of fossil fuel prices on international markets. Nuclear, alongside renewables and other technologies, helps us do that."" ""It's really important that we get new capacity built, because we've got so much that is going offline in a relatively short period of time. ""We've left it a long time, and actually saying we should reassess and start again - we haven't got the luxury of time to be able to do that."""
Volatility,"Gold, rabbits and crypto: Venezuela's economic plans",2024-09-25,2018-10-02,By Daniel Gallas,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-45652921,"For years, Venezuela has been in the headlines for its economic woes, including chronic shortages of food and medicine. Inflation may hit the one million per cent mark this year and 2.3 million people have fled the country, becoming economic refugees. The government of Nicolas Maduro has responded with a raft of policies - some of them very unorthodox - to try to deal with what is arguably the worst economic crisis of the decade. From a digital currency backed by oil, to urban farming projects that include breeding rabbits and chickens at home, the government in Caracas has not been lacking in creativity. But have these ideas helped Venezuelans? This year more than $20bn (£15bn) has been raised through cryptocurrency Initial Coin Offerings (ICO), according to UK-based portal Coinschedule. The point of an ICO is to raise funds to create a new digital asset, such as a cryptocurrency. Some of them are attractive because the high volatility in their exchange rates can produce great returns. To the issuer, an ICO is a great way to raise funds. In February, Venezuela's government said it raised $735m with the launch of the ""petro"" - claiming it was the world's first virtual currency issued by a sovereign nation.  If that number is true, the petro's ICO would have been the fourth largest in the world in 2018. But it is hard to verify the government's claims. In the cryptocurrency world, very few trust any official information released about the petro so far. ""Reaction from the cryptocurrency community has been a mixture of dumbfoundedness and anger,"" says Alex Tapscott from the Blockchain Research Institute. Information about how much oil Venezuela produces is sketchy.  ""The government says each unit of the petro is backed by oil,"" says Mr Tapscott. ""But we have no proof at all. There is very little technical information about it."" Recently, Mr Maduro announced that Venezuela's revamped currency would be pegged to the petro, and that the cryptocurrency would be soon introduced in international trade. The BBC asked Venezuela's Superintendence of Cryptoassets for more information, but received no reply. Mr Tapscott says the government's attempt to launch its own cryptocurrency is eclipsing a more significant change in Venezuela's economy: the rise of Bitcoin, the world's most popular cryptocurrency. According to statistics website Coin Dance, the weekly trade of bitcoins in bolivars grew 58-fold since the beginning of this year, as people searched for new ways to store value amidst growing inflation. Oil is not the only abundant resource in Venezuela. The country claims to have the world's fourth largest gold mine, although currently Venezuela is not even in the top ten list of gold producing nations. Earlier this month, the government launched its Savings in Gold programme, allowing Venezuelans to buy certificates that entitle them to 1.5g or 2.5g gold bars. As with the petro, economists say the whole system depends on the government's credibility. It is Venezuela's government, not international markets, that stipulates the price of gold in sovereign bolivars. So Venezuelans who take part in the programme are buying their government's word. Tareck El Aissami, Venezuela's minister of industry, says 12 million bolivares soberanos (about $200,000 according to one exchange rate) has been raised to help the government ""reach fiscal balance and protect social investment"". No-one from the government would talk to the BBC about this move. In March, Nicolas Maduro published a video on Twitter, in which he is seen feeding 152 chickens and collecting their eggs. ""We can all produce (food). This is urban agriculture,"" he said. ""If (First Lady) Cilia and I can do it, why can't everyone else?"" Last year, the government announced a pilot programme to distribute rabbits to the population, extolling the virtues of its meat. But the plan became a joke even within Mr Maduro's cabinet. Agriculture minister Freddy Bernal said people had become emotionally attached to the rabbits and were keeping them as pets. ""We need a publicity campaign on radio, TV, in newspapers, in cartoons, everywhere, so that the people understand that rabbits aren't pets but two and a half kilos of meat,"" Mr Bernal said at the time. A more orthodox approach against the crisis was announced in August 2018.  The government renamed the national currency, dropped five zeros from it, raised the minimum wage to 34 times its previous level, and promised to curb fuel subsidies.  But analysts say these measures are merely ""a small blow against the wind, when there is a tsunami"". ""All these measures are completely irrelevant, there is no economic plan in Venezuela,"" says Siobhan Morden, a Latin America expert at financial services firm Nomura. ""The damage [already done to the economy] is so extensive that any measures, even if orthodox, are only piecemeal."" Ms Morden says the petro cryptocurrency and the Savings in Gold programme are a distraction.  Financial services group Nomura's assessment of Venezuela is a dire one. It says oil production is declining by 50,000 barrels per day - and the country is dropping its output by almost a third every year. The fiscal deficit is about 20% of GDP and there is very little economic data coming out of Venezuela that can be trusted or fact-checked. The prolonged crisis has also wiped out much of Venezuela's industrial sector. To begin to tackle Venezuela's crisis, Ms Morden says the government would have to completely overhaul the economy, by dismantling price and exchange controls and stabilising the oil sector. For now, nothing resembling those measures seems to be on Mr Maduro's agenda. "
Volatility,Alderney set to raise electricity price cap,2024-09-25,2022-12-22,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-guernsey-64053213,"Electricity prices in Alderney could go up in 2023, depending on market volatility for diesel which the island's generators use, the States has warned. The Policy and Finance Committee has agreed to raise the price cap from 50p to 60p per unit. The cap sets a maximum price Alderney Electricity Ltd (AEL) can charge for each kilowatt hour of electricity. The increase is subject to approval by the full States of Alderney next year. AEL raised its prices earlier this year, but also introduced a cost relief for customers for three months from 1 May. The draft Ordinance to be placed on the Billet does not commit to an increase in electricity prices, but allows AEL the flexibility to quickly respond to market forces, within the constraints of the revised cap. The States of Alderney said if activated in full, the measure could lead to an increase on typical domestic electricity bills of about 20% during 2023 - less than £25 per month for most households. Under the existing 50p price cap and rising world fuel prices, AEL would be unable to meet financial expectations and maintain its current infrastructure, the States said. It said improved network efficiency and station upgrades had helped to keep prices down. AEL managing director James Lancaster said: ""We have budgeted for a worst-case scenario and it may be that fuel prices will begin to return to normality enabling underlying electricity prices to be brought back below the level of the current cap. ""Projected growth in both capacity and functionality in line with the current upgrade plan, and future plans in line with Energy Policy objectives, will require that we deliver a net profit margin of twice the current targeted level.  ""Any benefit AEL may derive from lower than anticipated fuel prices or other costs next year can be targeted toward such improvements."" Follow BBC Guernsey on Twitter and Facebook.

Volatility,US says FTX fraud 'one of biggest' in its history,2024-09-25,2022-12-13,By Chris Vallance,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-63957020,"US authorities have charged Sam Bankman-Fried with ""one of the biggest financial frauds in US history"" in the failed cryptocurrency exchange FTX. The former FTX boss was arrested on Monday. Mr Bankman-Fried built a ""house of cards on a foundation of deception"", Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler said. Officials have also accused him of violating campaign finance laws.  Mr Gensler added that the charges for alleged fraud were a warning for other platforms to comply with US laws. The US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) also announced charges against Mr Bankman-Fried in parallel actions.  At a news conference on Tuesday, Damian Williams, the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York, said that the fraud Mr Bankman-Fried is accused of is among the largest in US history.  In addition to accusing Mr Bankman-Fried of defrauding lenders, investors and customers, Mr Williams accused him of using ""tens of millions"" in ill-gotten gains for illegal campaign contributions to Democrats and Republicans alike.  ""All this dirty money was used in service of Bankman-Fried's desire to buy bipartisan influence and impact the direction of public policy in Washington,"" Mr Williams said.  Speaking to BBC News earlier this month, Mr Bankman-Fried sought to distance himself from accusations of illegal activity. ""I didn't knowingly commit fraud. I don't think I committed fraud. I didn't want any of this to happen. I was certainly not nearly as competent as I thought I was,"" he told BBC News cyber reporter Joe Tidy. Mr Bankman-Fried also denied allegations he must have been aware that FTX's affiliated trading company, Alameda Research, was using FTX customer funds. He was once viewed as a young version of legendary US investor Warren Buffett. As recently as late October, he had a net worth estimated at more than $15bn (£12.1bn). A well-known political donor, he was arrested in the Bahamas and is being held there in custody pending extradition to the US. He said on Tuesday he would fight the extradition. Meanwhile, the firm's new chief executive, John Ray, told a US congressional committee that FTX's collapse appeared to be the result of it being controlled by a small group of ""grossly inexperienced, non-sophisticated individuals"". He said he had seen ""an utter lack of record-keeping - no internal controls whatsoever"". Last month, FTX filed for bankruptcy in the US, leaving many users unable to withdraw their funds. According to a court filing last month, FTX owed its 50 largest creditors almost $3.1bn. The FTX exchange allowed customers to trade normal money for cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. Cryptocurrencies are not currencies in the traditional sense, but are stored online and act more like investment vehicles or securities - often with a high degree of volatility. Their anonymity means they have been favoured for criminal activities such as drug dealing and ransomware attacks, but their supporters say there is huge potential for innovation - and independence from governments. Since 2019, Bahamas-based FTX had raised more than $1.8bn from equity investors, the SEC said, including approximately $1.1bn from about 90 US-based investors. It is alleged that while Mr Bankman-Fried promoted FTX as a ""safe, responsible crypto asset trading platform"", in reality he ""orchestrated a years-long fraud"" to conceal from FTX's investors the diversion of FTX customers' funds to Alameda Research LLC, his privately held crypto hedge fund. The SEC also alleges that he concealed FTX's exposure to Alameda's significant holdings of overvalued FTX-affiliated tokens. Mr Bankman-Fried is also accused of ""co-mingling"" FTX customers' funds at Alameda to make ""undisclosed venture investments, lavish real estate purchases, and large political donations"". In what has turned out to be one of his last interviews before arrest, Mr Bankman-Fried seemed extremely confident - telling me he would not be arrested and was innocent of any criminal wrongdoing. The 30-year-old turned up in his trademark shorts and scruffy T-shirt, seeming surprisingly calm. But he did admit he was not getting much sleep since his empire collapsed and he became crypto public enemy number one. Mr Bankman-Fried spoke to us not in his home, but in an apartment still owned by FTX, in the luxury Albany complex about 30 minutes from the Bahamian capital, Nassau.  Before we started recording, we were told not to take any shots of the multimillion pound yachts or manicured gardens in the marina. We were also warned not to film his apartment building, which he has had to vacate for ""safety reasons"". Once we began the interview, Mr Bankman-Fried spoke for 35 minutes with no topic or question ruled out. As in other recent interviews, he admitted to mismanaging his FTX empire but tried to distance himself from any criminal wrongdoing. He also said he did not think he would be arrested and, off-camera, heavily hinted details would soon emerge to make the public more believing of his version of events. ""FTX operated behind a veneer of legitimacy Mr Bankman-Fried created,"" said Gurbir S Grewal, director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. ""But as we allege in our complaint, that veneer wasn't just thin, it was fraudulent."" He added that FTX's collapse highlighted the risk unregistered crypto asset trading platforms can pose to consumers and investors.   The SEC charged Mr Bankman-Fried with violating the anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  In New York, Mr Williams vowed that authorities ""are not done"" with the investigation and called on ""anyone who participated in wrongdoing"" to come forward.  ""Come see us before we come and see you,"" he said.  Robert Greenall and Bernd Debusmann Jr also contributed to this article"
Volatility,"Fuel prices still cause for concern, says watchdog",2024-09-25,2023-11-09,By Lora Jones,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-67368097,"Drivers are still not getting a fair price on fuel at the pumps, the UK's competition watchdog has warned. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said prices had risen by as much as 13.9p per litre since the end of May, partly due to wholesale costs. But it said, more recently, while those costs have fallen, the retail price for petrol and diesel has not.  CMA boss Sarah Cardell said there was ""cause for concern"" that competition is not working. The findings are contained in the watchdog's first report on fuel prices following an investigation into competition in the market, which recommended a body be created to monitor what retailers are charging drivers.   The CMA found that petrol prices had increased from 142.9p per litre at the end of May to 154p per litre at the end of October, up 11.1p.  For diesel, prices rose from 147.9p per litre to 161.8p per litre over the same period, an increase of 13.9p. Wholesale oil prices rose between June, July and August, said the CMA, largely due to global pressures on the energy market.  But it said: ""Wholesale prices then reduced in September and October while retail prices did not. ""While it is too early to draw definitive conclusions, this could indicate a lack of competitive response from fuel retailers if this trend continues.""  Higher food and fuel prices have been big drivers in the soaring cost of living and official figures also suggest that the price paid by drivers at the pump rose sharply in September. The CMA examined the so-called ""retail spread"" - the difference between what retailers pay to buy fuel and the price consumers are charged - between May and last month.  It discovered that there had been ""significant increases"" in the retail spread for petrol and diesel.   ""More recent trends give cause for concern that competition is still not working well in this market to hold down pump prices,"" said the CMA's Ms Cardell.  She cautioned, however, that the information contained in the report is based on voluntary information and is missing some big fuel retailers. Off the back of its investigation into the fuel market in the UK, the watchdog is calling for a new monitoring body to be created, which would have powers to demand pricing information from all retailers. The RAC said that the latest figures suggested that drivers were still ""being taken advantage of at the pumps"".  The RAC's Simon Williams said: ""It's very disappointing that the CMA has found that major fuel retailers are still taking far bigger margins than they have done in the past. ""We believe the situation is currently worse than ever as the wholesale fuel market is down significantly, yet forecourt prices are falling like the proverbial feather,"" he said, adding that any new body responsible for tracking prices would need to have the power to take action against big retailers. ""We fear little will change even then,"" he said. Gordon Balmer, executive director of the Petrol Retailers' Association, said that he would always encourage drivers to shop around to make sure they are getting the best deal. ""With the volatility of the global fuel market, it is important that motorists are given the opportunity to search for the cheapest prices available to them,"" he said. The trade association also said that it would work closely with the competition watchdog on developing the new scheme for monitoring prices."
Volatility,How one estate creates its own energy to cut bills,2024-09-25,2022-10-30,By Paul Pigott,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-63300680,"Access to solar panels and a home battery has reduced energy bill worries for Nikita Harris on one of Europe's largest green retrofit projects.  ""Where I used to worry going to bed, I don't have to worry now,"" said Nikita, 26, whose home in Swansea now runs partially on a battery. Some 644 properties are being connected to a unique energy-sharing scheme, social housing provider Pobl said. Housing Minister Julie James has called the scheme ""transformational"". Power from linked solar panels on roofs across the Penderi estate is used to charge batteries in homes.  Nikita's battery is fitted to a wall just inside the entrance of her terraced property. By limiting the use of her big appliances to when the sun is up, the mother-of-two said she had cut her electricity bills significantly. ""I used to spend £20 a week on my electric,"" she said, ""now with the solar panels and battery I'm putting in £10 a week. ""By having the battery in my home... I feel calmer,"" she said, explaining how sad she is for other people faced with having to limit their electricity use.   ""It's hard watching people say they're struggling to get food or do they get electric,"" she said. ""It is worrying times for everybody, but this has helped. "" With energy storage and smart energy management technology now installed in 200 homes, Pobl said the estate had already started to cut the amount of power being drawn from the national grid.  The project was funded by £3.5m from the European Union, £1.5m from Pobl, and a £900,000 infrastructure upgrade by Western Power. Retrofitted homes on the estate are expected to generate up to 60% of their own electricity, reducing bills, and cutting carbon emissions by as much as 350 tonnes per year. ""The aim is to... protect our customers from the peaks and troughs in the volatility in the market that we currently see now,"" said Pobl director of regeneration Solitaire Pritchard. Despite the size of the retrofit, which Pobl described as Europe's largest, Penderi represents a tiny fraction of the 19,000 properties owned by the social housing provider.   ""We hope to learn how people live with this technology,"" Ms Pritchard said, explaining how using a battery to power your home is new for most people.  ""We're hoping that what we've learned here can be shared across the sector and obviously then applied across all homes in Wales."" The company doing the retrofit is renewable energy supplier Sero, and project manager Anne-Marie Ratcliffe said a key part of the work was teaching residents how to get the most out of the technology.  ""This is the biggest energy retrofit project of its kind in the UK so it's something incredibly innovative and incredibly exciting to be a part of,"" she said. ""It's incredibly important, given both the climate crisis and the energy fuel cost price crisis at the moment,"" she added. ""The really innovative part... is the sharing scheme whereby if you can't have [solar panels] on your home you can still benefit from the installations that are happening around the community.  ""Every person who's participating in this scheme will see a benefit to their energy bills and their energy usage in their homes,"" she added. In the coming months, she said, any excess power produced at Penderi will be fed back into the network grid, generating rebates on participants' electric bills.  ""This project is reducing the amount of energy being drawn off the grid,"" she said. ""That is reducing the amount of carbon that has been produced by the community as a whole and by individuals within their homes."" She said that if the project helped to ""prove"" the technology, it will ""hopefully then roll out to more communities"". Lessons learned from the project will also inform the wider spread of renewable energy technology in thousands of homes throughout the Swansea Bay City Region, as part of the £1.3bn City Deal, in the Homes as Power Stations project - subject to the approval of the UK and Welsh governments. This would see energy efficiency technology retrofitted to 7,000 homes with a further 3,300 new build homes also benefiting as part of the project, which is led by Neath Port Talbot council."
Volatility,The biggest threat to India’s growth?,2024-09-25,2017-05-19,Edd Gent,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20170510-why-automation-could-be-a-threat-to-indias-growth,"Smart machines, robots, and other forms of automation could either be an economic poison or cure in a developing country like India – and this change will affect how businesses worldwide outsource work. Ravi is one of thousands of Indian IT workers who will lose their jobs this year, caught between a slump in India’s previously booming IT industry and new technology threatening to replace human workers. Until last month he worked at Cognizant Technology Solutions – a firm headquartered in the US but with the bulk of its workforce in India. The company is under pressure to cut costs and is expected to shed between 6,000 and 10,000 'underperformers' this year. Market volatility and rising protectionism in countries like the USA, where much of India’s IT outsourcing work comes from, saw Cognizant’s revenue grow at its slowest pace in two decades last year, and its peers in the Indian IT industry are in the same boat. But at the same time, rapidly improving automation technology is allowing software to carry out routine IT support work and repetitive back office tasks previously performed by humans – the very tasks global companies originally outsourced to India to take advantage of cheaper labour. In February, Cognizant’s CFO said it would “aggressively” employ automation to “optimise” its services. Meanwhile, India’s third-largest IT firm, Infosys, said automation allowed it to shift 9,000 workers from low-skill jobs to more advanced projects, like machine learning and artificial intelligence, last year. Its competitor Wipro redeployed 3,200 in 2016, and predicts it will move another 4,500 this year. Yet this has been accompanied by a significant slowing in hiring. IT body Nasscom’s annual review predicted a 20-to-25% reduction in jobs in the industry over the next three years. “Cognizant has not conducted any layoffs,” a Cognizant spokesperson said. “New machines and technologies are about helping cut costs, improve efficiencies, and increase sophistication in building and delivering services. They are not about altogether replacing the human element, but about elevating the role people play and the value they bring to their roles.” But it can be hard to pinpoint exactly whose jobs have been lost to automation. Researchers in the UK, for example, have shown that some roles in today’s global economy are more at risk than others.  Ravi, whose name has been changed, worked as a software tester – a role particularly vulnerable to automated takeover. ""In testing, already it has been introduced and it's coming in very fast,” he says. ""If a job requires four manual testers, automation can reduce it to one.” He’s now job hunting, but says opportunities for the kind of work he was doing before are limited and he will probably have to adapt: take a course on automated software testing and then try to secure a position. He worries this may be a repeating pattern. ""Maybe after five years some new technologies are coming and we have to learn those, too,” he says. India’s IT weak spot? Since the 1990s Indian firms have carried out back office tasks, and IT services like data entry, running call centres and testing software for foreign companies at cut-price rates by throwing cheap labour at them. But as machines become adept at this repetitive, rule-based work, the low-skill jobs – where the bulk of Indian IT workers are employed – are the most at risk. “It’s been happening for the last two or three years in an accelerated fashion,” says Gopinathan Padmanabhan, head of innovation at IT company Mphasis. “It’s a reality you can't shy away from.” This shift will go hand-in-hand with new opportunities in emerging areas – data science, artificial intelligence and big data – but these will require new skills and probably fewer employees. ""They will have to find new roles and train themselves to become relevant in the new age,” says Padmanabhan. “And we're not talking about too far into the future… the next three to five years.” Of course, losing jobs to automation is a concern across the developed world. But India’s case is unique. A stable job at one of the big IT companies is a major aspiration for many Indians, which probably explains why fears of technological unemployment have featured so prominently in newspapers here in recent months. But despite contributing 9.3% of the country’s GDP, according to Nasscom, the IT industry only employs 3.7 million of the nation’s roughly half a billion working adults. So how big of a threat is it actually to the Indian workforce? World Bank data estimates 69% of today’s jobs in India are threatened by automation. And India isn’t alone: China’s figure was 77% and other developing countries also scored highly. India is already struggling to create jobs amid rapid growth. Its working-age population increased by 300 million between 1991 and 2013, according to UN figures, but the number of people employed only rose by 140 million. Still, robots replacing jobs en masse is unrealistic in the medium term in India – or anywhere else – but the effects are already being felt. Last September, Indian textiles giant Raymond said it would replace 10,000 jobs with robots over three years. Union leader Vinodh Kumar works at BMW’s factory in Chennai – India’s automotive hub. His facility isn’t in danger of automation, but he knows union leaders at Hyundai’s plant where the entire body shop and most of the paint shop was automated. “The majority of the body shop employees lost their jobs,” he said. “The permanent employees they tried to relocate, but the contract labourers and the trainees lost their jobs.” Other sectors at risk include pharmaceuticals, food and beverages, logistics and security. Mohandas Pai, former CFO of Infosys, says it is unlikely to impact high-skill jobs like architects or high-quality coders, or even lower-end jobs in the service industry like restaurant staff and hairdressers. ""The fat middle is at threat, which is rule-based work. Like work in banks, work in offices, work in factories,” he says. ‘Hollowing out’ the middle class The World Bank’s 2016 World Development Report noted a global trend towards “hollowing out” of the labour force. As technology streamlines routine tasks, middle-skill jobs like clerical workers and machine operators decline while both high-skill and low-skill ones increase. And in developing nations like India, that can be a huge problem. ""Those middle-skill jobs have traditionally been the path out of poverty,” says World Bank senior economist Indhira Santos. “So that polarisation into the labour market could translate into a polarisation of society and income.” This trend isn’t down to technology alone – globalisation and urbanisation contribute. But pulling away “the ladder to the middle class”, as the report puts it, could be particularly damaging in a developing country like India. After all, there is a reason why companies are turning to new technologies. “Automation is an imperative to improve competitiveness, quality and efficiency,” says CEO of Siemens’ India Sunil Mathur. That helps compete against cheap imports, boost exports and increases domestic demand and therefore jobs, he says. Samay Kohli, co-founder of home-grown warehouse robotics company Grey Orange, agrees. India lags well behind the developed world on labour productivity, which acts as a major handbrake on growth. “You have to automate to be globally competent,” he says. “If we don't improve our infrastructure, our productivity we will not have a chance to compete globally.” Grey Orange builds ‘Butler’ robots that fetch and store products and ‘Sorters’ that automatically scan and sort packages in the warehouses of e-commerce and logistics giants like Flipkart, Jabong and DTDC. Kohli says the Butler can pick up to 600 items an hour. That eclipses the 100 items a human worker can manage – invaluable efficiency in a country where supply chain costs are double those of Western countries. Increasing worker productivity could stifle employment, but Kohli claims they are simply filling gaps. Annual staff turnover in warehousing is 300%, he says. Rural Indians come looking for better earnings, but onerous targets, low wages and urban living costs mean they rarely last long. But robots are harder to sway. Kohli claims job numbers in their facilities have stayed level, but attrition has reduced. “This labour is just brute labour,” he says. “Even though they're doing jobs, they never get out of poverty. When they start using these kinds of collaborative robots in the mix they work better, more efficiently and are happier with their jobs."" Heads of IBM Research India Sriram Raghavan agrees that in a developing country like India, automation normally fills gaps rather than replacing people. India has 330,000 fewer doctors than the WHO’s minimum recommendation, but Raghavan says automation can help plug this kind of talent shortage. Smart machines combined with the internet could allow doctors and teachers to provide personalised services to many more people than they can today. The plight of IT workers like Ravi, though, demonstrates that automation is already encroaching on areas without gaps to be filled. Pai says India has the luxury of time compared to developed countries, as labour will remain cheaper than automation for a decade, and huge unmet demand for infrastructure and services can produce lots of jobs. But the World Bank report highlights an ever-accelerating race between skills and technology and that countries like India need to act now to future-proof their populations’ capabilities. Future-proofing jobs from robots With automation taking on the routine tasks at the heart of today’s workplace, the jobs of the future will focus on skills like critical thinking, collaboration and creativity. India’s education system has a reputation for learning by rote and Indian Institute of Technology Madras engineering professor Ashok Jhunjhunwala agrees most institutions aren’t adequately preparing young people. But things are changing. He leads a government-sponsored pilot where professors from leading colleges use virtual labs to teach students at struggling engineering colleges. And start-ups are introducing extra-curricular robotics classes teaching problem-solving skills vital for future jobs. Most importantly, he says the country’s young population is sharp, adaptable, and future-oriented. ""If automation displaces one thing they move to another,” he says. “They are recognising the need to continually upskill.” IBM’s Raghavan says smart machines that automatically analyse students' performance and preferences can help guide them through this fast-moving terrain by combining data on their skills with job opportunities and available courses. He says: ""Then it’s less about a race, but getting people on a journey. Maybe the skill profile changes every five years rather than every 10, but at the same time technology is helping navigate that landscape."" That may sound like blue-sky thinking, but in February, Microsoft and LinkedIn announced Project Sangam – a programme providing LinkedIn training, with progress automatically added to profiles so companies can shortlist candidates, as well as personalised job recommendations. Resistance is futile Jhunjhunwala thinks India’s development challenges are so large, it needs all the help it can get. And fighting automation is futile anyway. ""The changes going on in the world, including automation, are not something decided by us – but it's going to happen,"" he says. ""We don’t want to be passive and let automation impact us. We want to develop something with this automation."" And in the race between technology and skills – as India tries to keep pace with the very technology that helped launch its economy on the world stage – he thinks the country has a secret weapon: a deeper value placed on education than in the West. After all, the pinnacle of India’s ancient caste system was the educated Brahmin priest – not the Kshatriya warrior. ""It's part of our Indian heritage,"" says Pai. ""India is the only civilisation in the world where the educated gurus were placed on the totem pole higher than the king. In all other nations, soldiers and might ruled and knowledge bowed to the mighty. In India, knowledge is above the might of the state.""

Volatility,The faces of global power,2024-09-25,2017-10-27,Javier Hirschfeld,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20171027-the-ultimate-faces-of-global-power,"Are there common features in the faces of a country’s leaders? BBC Future spoke to two artists who have explored this question in their work from two different angles. Turkish-born artist Guney Soykan grew up in a home where politics and news were always present. His project Face of a Nation is a visual reflection on the volatile political situation of his native country and on the global representations of power. Soykan creates portraits of diferent nations based on images of their leaders of the last 50 years. He used Google to find the most iconic portraits, he then splices them up and puts them together to create a composite portrait of countries like Turkey, US or North Korea. The result are striking images that raise questions on gender, race and representations in power. What’s the process behind your project?  The starting point for every image was curiosity: is there a story hidden in the face of that nation? With this project I was trying to explore how different nations approach their leaders and democracy. So I’m interested in seeing different stories, unusual rhythms in the leadership timeline of the countries. That’s why I tried not only to pick the nations on the spotlight, but also the nations that are very different when it comes to view of leadership. I tried to use the official portraits in most cases but that wasn’t always possible. The internet was my main data source for this project so when I didn’t have access to the official photo, I tried to pick the most common photo of the leader. I believe this gives a new perspective to the project, namely the way that leaders of the nations are represented in today’s world. What was the motivation to create this project? My father is a local politician, so I grew up in an apartment in which the news programs were always on. This made me build an interest towards politics. Seeing the strategy and communication levels in it grew my awareness even more over the years. So when I came up with this idea, I was curious to see how the faces are going to look like. I wondered if the portraits will tell stories of the nations. {""image"":{""pid"":""p05kyv10”}} Have the changes in Turkey’s democracy been part of that preoccupation about the topic? If so, how? The starting point of the idea was the November 1, 2015 elections in Turkey. The results were a shocking surprise for the opposition. Besides all of the controversy surrounding government actions, Erdogan and his AK Party won the election again, and by a major landslide. I believe that even the winners were not expecting such a victory. I was trying to understand the reasons behind the results. One of the things I realised was that voting behaviour is very emotional; the elected leaders are a reflection of their society.And to me, that reflection is not only about the ideas, but also about the personality of the leader. I believe that people tend to vote for leaders with whom they can identify. So I thought, if I bring together all the elected political leader portraits in a timeline, that face will be a historical reflection of that country. This visual data might be helpful to perceive how the society has evolved over the decades. This is how the Face of a Nation project was born. What have been the most surprising findings in this process? It was interesting to see big political shifts or major instabilities that shed light on the current political landscape, and I was surprised to see how the physical attributes of the leaders give away hints about the politics of the countries. For example, you see a portrait of a man who is half-white, half-black in the face of South Africa, signaling a major turn in the political tide. After all those years of being governed by white people, the majority of the country got power and changed the face of their country dramatically. Turkey is a good example of seeing how the past affects the present. The politically instable history of my country strikes you as soon as you see the image. Because of constant political volatility, many past leaders didn’t get the chance to create an iconic image of themselves. That’s why finding some of the portraits for this image was a difficult task. How have the people of their respective countries reacted?  I had the chance to talk some people. Italy’s face is made of 19 leaders and they are aware of the unstable flow in their political scene. But when they see the difference side by side with other nations, it becomes very surprising for them. My Turkish friends don’t like the face they see in Turkey. But these are all very liberal, left wing people and Turkey is always ruled by the right wing so I can’t blame them. And a few friends told me that they find the face of France very attractive. From your experience in design and publicity agencies, how do you feel the face affect the way we perceive leaders? If you look at politics through the eyes of an advertising professional, I think it’s fair to say that every politician is a product. Every single thing he or she says and does shapes this product. The face is the packaging of the product. It’s makes you decide if you want to see more or not. The face is the start of political communication. When I was working on Face of a Nation, it was very surprising to find so many signs of political communication in the portraits of leaders. For example, the official presidential photos released by the White House are always the same — facing to the right and smiling at camera. These are friendly, politically correct photos. Meanwhile, Russian leaders have always been portrayed in a very serious and powerful pose; their main aim is to create the image of a strong leader. I think these two examples reflect a lot about the way politics is done publicly in those countries. Another interesting example was North Korea. It was almost too easy to put together the faces of the North Korean leaders. Not only because there are only three and they are all part of the same family lineage, but also their most popular portraits are almost identical. They are all portrayed from the same angle, wearing the same glasses and with a very similar haircut. North Korean propaganda leaves no room for doubt that the ideology of their first leader Kim Il-sung continues throughout his successors. Unlike North Korea, Italy has had the most leaders and changes in power of all the images so far. You can actually see the political instability. However, the really fascinating thing is that the image is still strangely homogenous when you look at it. It’s interesting to try to work out why that is. Are Italian voters drawn to a certain political “look?” Or are the physical commonalities of the Italian leaders merely coincidence?  Also, almost all the Italian leaders are wearing eyeglasses, which helps the image look uniform. It makes you wonder why so many Italian leaders are photographed with eyeglasses. Is it a communication strategy? Perhaps the idea is that a person who wears eyeglasses may have more authority and look more intelligent.   *** Argentinian artist Alejandro Almaraz uses the overlay image technique to create haunting composite portraits that show a consistency in the official representation of power through the times. This is especially present in the All Presidents of the Democratic Republic of North Korea 1972-2008. On the other hand, Margaret Thatcher’s pearl necklace in All the Prime Ministers Appointed by Elizabeth II (1952-2008) is an exception. He uses as few as four or as many as 40 official portraits to create the composite. The result is a ghostly portrait that shows the history of nations and the way their leaders chose to be represented, following the pictorial tradition also used by previous leaders. What’s the process behind your project?  My project Portraits of Power takes inspiration and uses the principles of the process of overlapping images was a development in late 1800s by a British scientist. His name was Sir. Francis Galton, known as the father of eugenics. In 1880 and at the request of a collaborator, Galton began to make a series of portraits composed by a large number of overlapping negatives. These portraits tried to register differences and similarities between different social groups. For my project I use the same principles, but I’m more interested in analysing the way each country, in a precise period of time, use images to present to their people. What was the motivation to create this project? I believe we are living in an era where the images are the main tool to produce meaning. My work tries to create a place to think about the relationships between images and things, images and reality. I chose to work with portraits of country leaders because they depict the moment where power depicts itself. My intention is to try to think about how each country in each period of time use images to present itself. Your project uses painted and photographed portraits. How does your work sit in the portraiture tradition? This question is really interesting. In my series I don’t make a difference between painted portraits or photography. If you look at All American Presidents from 1789 to 1889, 2008 a big portion of the images that compose are painted portraits. In my opinion images are not just photographs. Since ancient times both painting and monuments erected around a political figure, a king, emperor or pharaoh in most cases aim to perpetuate in the collective imagination, endure and sustain a particular political social system. But I think the most interesting point is to think that images are not synonymous with truth. They are a construction. And I think this is where we have to generate a critical conscience. In the process of producing the work, have you noticed any kind of trend in the faces of power from the older portraits you work with to today? Yes, I found that World War Two meant a big change in the way each country depicts their leaders. Colour photography appears, smiles, eyes looking to the camera. It’s a moment the main aesthetic currents of the classical portrait are abandoned in favor of a simpler, less heroic way to present.  Are there any other surprising findings in the process of creating the project? I’ve come across many interesting things. For example, how communist countries present their leaders compared to Western democracies. They are were amongst the first to start using colour. Also, most subjects are looking straight to the camera. Something that you don't find in other contemporary non-communist countries. How do you think the faces affect people when choosing their political leader? I think nowaday people prefer a more natural pose. I think people find it easier to empathise with portraits that looks closer to the everyday life and regular person, someone they can relate to. -- Discover more: To find out what the average American politician looks like, BBC Future commissioned a composite face, which is a blend of all US Senators and House representatives. Click here to discover what it looks like, and what it says about US political representation in 2017.

Volatility,How long-haul travel may change,2024-09-25,2022-05-16,Ashley Nunes,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20220513-how-long-haul-travel-will-change-post-covid,"Airlines are rethinking long-haul travel as passengers cautiously return to flying. What’s likely to change? Australian flag carrier Qantas made history recently by ferrying passengers nonstop between South America and Australia. The aeroplane – a Boeing 787 Dreamliner – departed Buenos Aires shortly past noon local time. Some 9,300 miles (14.973km) and 17-plus hours later, QF 14 landed in Darwin. In doing so, the carrier set two internal records: longest distance covered and longest time in the air for a commercial flight. Captain Alex Passerini, who commanded QF 14, later said: ""Qantas has always stepped up to a challenge, especially when it comes to long-haul travel, and this flight is an excellent example of the capabilities and attention to detail of our flight planning team."" Contrary to popular belief, flying for so many hours isn't entirely new. In the 1930s, Pan Am airliners hopscotched across the Pacific Ocean with regularity. Passengers on board the Honolulu clipper could expect 20-hour flight times when shuttling between Hawaii and the continental United States. Qantas followed suit a decade later. In 1943, the Flying Kangaroo launched service between Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) and Australia, its flying boats taking up to 33 hours to complete the trip. Passengers who did were subsequently admitted to ""The Rare and Secret Order of the Double Sunrise"", so named because of the two sunrises they would see during the trip. The 21st Century has seen the long-haul, nonstop trend continue. In 2004, Singapore Airlines made headlines when it launched service between New York and Singapore; a 9,500-plus mile (15,289km) haul that can – depending on prevailing winds – take up to 19 hours. Less punishing (though not by much) is Qatar Airways’ Doha to Auckland, New Zealand service which clocks in at 9,000 miles (14,484km). Passengers on board the Boeing 777 cross 10 time zones and virtually the entire length of the Indian Ocean, continental Australia, and the Tasman Sea before arriving in the City of Sails. Trip time? 18 hours. Similar feats of flight are expected later this year when United and American Airlines launch services between the United States and India. You might also like: Fun stuff, minus the indignities of air travel of course. For one thing, there is nothing appealing about being sealed in a long metal tube. Do so for ever-longer periods and you are likely to end up grumpy. When passengers are grumpy, flying becomes less fun; and if something isn’t fun, why do it? Early flyers were more fortunate. High fares limited who could fly, the result being a select few could experience luxurious service for hours. Today’s flyers want to fly further, faster, and in style, all while paying less. Catering to these demands requires innovative thinking and airlines are increasingly investing in products that will keep long-haul passengers happy. Here are three of them. Engine technology Jets need fuel, lots of it. The Boeing 747 – an icon of the long-haul travel era – burns jet fuel at an astounding rate of one gallon per second (4.54 litres per second). Consequently, to keep jets like this flying for hours, you need a large petrol tank. Aeroplanes like the Boeing 747 carry upwards of 57,000 gallons (259,127 litres) of fuel (the record holder is the Antonov An-225 which can carry nearly 100,000 gallons, or 454,000 litres). By comparison, the average four-door Sedan holds closer to 15 gallons (62.2 litres). A bigger tank may help you go further but expect your gas bills to be heftier. At current gas prices, topping off the average Sedan will cost you $50 (£37.30); a Boeing 747, upwards of $140,000 (£104,480). Such weighty expenses bode badly for passengers, much of whose cash goes toward paying airline fuel costs. Making things worse is volatility in the energy market which can cause massive swings in fuel prices. For example, a one cent change in fuel prices can produce a $40m (£29.8m) profit (or loss) for carriers.   But help is on the way. Engine manufacturers are studying – and succeeding – at making their products more efficient. A more efficient engine means less fuel burn, and less fuel burn lowers airline costs and (ideally), fares. Agnes Jocher, a professor of sustainable future mobility at the Technical University of Munich, says improvements in so-called ‘bypass ratios’ are key to lowering fuel use. This ratio indicates how much air flows around the engine versus through it. Jocher says, ""generally speaking, the higher the ratio, the more efficient the engine. The more efficient engine, the lower its fuel consumption."" Today’s jets burn on average 60% less fuel than the first generation of commercial aircraft, thanks in large part to bypass ratios improvements. Jocher expects this trend to continue as airlines keen to go long-haul, nonstop explore ways to trim costs. When it comes to saving fuel, she notes, ""higher bypass ratios are key"". Losing weight An efficient engine can help you burn less gas. But so can shedding weight. The reason comes down to simple physics. It takes more energy to move more mass. A heavier aeroplane will – all else being equal – burn more jet fuel than a lighter one. A lighter jet can also fly faster, shaving precious minutes off a flight. That bodes well for the airline (keen to maximise aeroplane productivity) and passengers (eager to arrive at their destination sooner). One way to curb aircraft weight is foregoing wiring and cables. These devices act as the connective tissue for jetliners, forming crucial links between the cockpit and aircraft systems like the landing gear, door sensors, and life support systems. The problem? They are heavy. By one estimate, wires, switches, and sockets can add over 16,000 lbs (7.2 tonnes) to a wide-body passenger jet. And more weight means more fuel burn. The solution? ""Fly-by-wireless"" systems, lightweight electronic technology which connects the cockpit and crucial aircraft control systems via the airwaves. Qantas recently took a more creative approach to shedding pounds. The carrier tasked industrial designer David Caon with creating a new line of in-flight cutlery and crockery. A key requirement? The assortment of plates, dishes, and utensils would have to be lighter than their predecessors. Achieving this feat was – to put it mildly – challenging. Caon says he and his team were ""not able to reduce the thickness of the crockery as this would affect its durability"". Instead, the team redesigned each piece to""“reduce profiles and minimise sections and use less material overall"". Caon describes the effort as a delicate balancing act to preserve ""functionality, durability, and weight"". These efforts paid off. The tableware – which debuted on Qantas’ 17-hour-long Perth to London route – was 11% lighter than its predecessors, producing ""great fuel saving benefits"". The new tableware was so popular Qantas subsequently used it across its entire network. Finessed food Aeroplanes are – despite the best mechanical innovations – cramped, noisy flying chunks of metal. And despite the inherent wonder of flight, if you've ever flown for hours, you know how boring plane travel can be. Airlines have responded by beefing up onboard amenities (including showers), entertainment (imagine having 4,500 TV and audio channels to choose from), and most notably, improved cuisine. For example, some passengers on the 17-hour trek between Los Angeles and Singapore are treated to a food spectacle, one that would rival dining at the best Michelin-starred restaurants. Orange-braised baby beet salad with endive, cherry tomatoes, and pine nuts? Perhaps citrus salmon over pumpkin dal, basmati rice and cilantro ghee? And spiced apple cake to finish? It's a far cry from the unrecognisable, reheated meals of the past. But just because food sounds good doesn’t mean taste follows suit. When flying high above the clouds, your normal sense of taste goes out the window. The often touted culprits are pressure drops (there’s less air at altitude) and plummeting humidity (cabin air is generally drier than the Sahara Desert). By one estimate, the combination of low pressure and dryness dulls your taste buds by 30%. However, there’s less talked about reason for waning palate sensitivity. A recent study found loud noise can cause savoury taste to be enhanced, and sweetness dulled. The study’s authors chalk it up to the noise-induced suppression of intense flavours which ultimately ""alter the perception of the foods we eat"". Their proposed fix? Rethinking menus to match taste preferences at altitude so passengers can – despite the constant buzzing of jet engines – better taste their food. Given the billions airlines are investing in going long-haul, spending a little more on ""menu diligence"" may well be a bargain. The Covid-19 pandemic has understandably depressed air travel demand. Closed borders and ever-changing testing requirements are less than enticing for any traveller. But as border restrictions ease, and as demand picks up, expect renewed interested in long-haul flight. Qantas – sensing passenger appetite for arriving sooner rather than later – has already renewed its commitment to ""Project Sunrise"", an ambitious effort to fly nonstop from its Sydney hub to prized markets like London, New York and Paris. With rivals sure to follow suit, innovation will discern which carriers make it and which ones don’t.

Volatility,How does sex define our personality?,2024-09-25,2016-10-12,Christian Jarrett,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20161011-do-men-and-women-really-have-different-personalities,"Personality profiles appear to reveal consistent (if subtle) differences between men and women – but are they meaningful? Christian Jarrett untangles a knotty and controversial question. It’s been said that men and women are so unlike each other, it’s as if they’re from different planets – a claim that continues to amuse and irritate. John Gray’s original mega-selling book Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus, first published in the early 1990s, has sold millions, spawning numerous parodies (such as Katherine Black and Finn Contini’s Women May Be from Venus, But Men are Really from Uranus) and even comedy stage shows, such as Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus, Live! currently playing off Broadway.) While our physical differences in size and anatomy are obvious, the question of psychological differences between the genders is a lot more complicated and controversial. There are issues around how to reliably measure the differences. And when psychologists find them, there are usually arguments over whether the causes are innate and biological, or social and cultural. Are men and women born different or does society shape them that way? These questions are particularly thorny when you consider our differences in personality. Most research suggests that men and women really do differ on some important traits. But are these differences the result of biology or cultural pressures? And just how meaningful are they in the real world? One possibility is that most differences are tiny in size but that combined they can have important consequences. One of the most influential studies in the field, published in 2001 by pioneering personality researchers Paul Costa, Robert McCrae and Antonio Terracciano, involved over 23,000 men and women from 26 cultures filling out personality questionnaires. Across these diverse cultures, including Hong Kong, USA, India and Russia, women consistently rated themselves as being warmer, friendlier and more anxious and sensitive to their feelings than did the men. The men, meanwhile, consistently rated themselves as being more assertive and open to new ideas. In the jargon of personality psychology, the women had scored higher on average on Agreeableness and Neuroticism and on one facet of Openness to Experience, while the men scored higher on one facet of Extraversion and a different facet of Openness to Experience. Similar results came in 2008 when a separate research team asked more than 17,000 people from 55 cultures, to fill out personality questionnaires. Again, women scored themselves higher on Agreeableness and Neuroticism and this time also on Conscientiousness and the warmth and gregariousness facets of Extraversion. One obvious criticism was that the participants were rating their own personalities. Perhaps the women and men differed simply because they were describing themselves in the way their societies expected them to be. But this seems unlikely because another study, led by McCrae and his collaborators, found broadly similar results from 12,000 people from 55 diverse cultures even though they were asked to rate the personality of a man or women they knew well, rather than their own personality. Adding to the picture, other research has shown that the genders begin to differ in personality very early in life. For example, one study published in 2013 looked at ratings of the temperament of 357 pairs of twins made when they were three-years-old. The boys were rated as more active, on average, than the girls, while the girls were rated as more shy and as having more control over their attention and behaviour. And gender differences in personality seem to persist into the twilight years. Another study looked at average differences in personality between women and men aged 65 to 98, and just as with research on younger adults, the elderly women tended to score higher on Neuroticism and Agreeableness than the elderly men. These findings make sense to evolutionary psychologists who say that our psychological traits today reflect the effect of survival demands experienced by our distant ancestors, and further, that these demands were different for men and women. For example, women with more nurturing personalities would have been more likely to succeed in raising vulnerable offspring, while men with bolder personalities would have been more successful in competing for mates. In turn, these traits would have been passed down to successive generations. Some scholars and commentators are uncomfortable with such a biological account of human behaviour, however, which they feel underestimates the influence of the social and cultural forces that shape who we are and how we behave. It’s almost certainly true that these social forces play a part. But all three large, cross-cultural studies by Costa, McCrae and others actually found men and women differed in average personality more in more developed and gender-egalitarian cultures, such as in Europe and America than in cultures in Asia and Africa where there is less gender equality (as measured by such things as women’s literacy and life expectancy). This seems to run against the idea that our personalities develop from cultural expectations around traditional gender roles. One explanation for this surprise finding is that the innate, biological factors that cause personality differences between men and women are more dominant in cultures where the genders are more equal. Such a scenario would certainly fit with what we know about the relative influence of genes and the environment on other psychological traits – for example, the more that schooling is made equal for everyone, the bigger the influence of inherited intelligence on academic outcomes. Another way to look at this issue is to use an implicit measure of personality. This involves using speed of keyboard responses (pressing different keyboard keys as fast as possible in response to different words) to test how readily people associate words pertaining to themselves with those describing different personality traits. The idea is that participants don’t realise they are revealing what they think about their personality and so their scores can’t be affected by attempts to conform to cultural expectations around gender. A research team led by Michelangelo Vianello at the University of Padua in Italy used this approach in 2013 with a study involving over 14,000 people surveyed via the Project Implicit website. Gender differences in personality were three times smaller using the implicit measure as compared with a standard personality questionnaire, suggesting the differences uncovered by standard questionnaires are influenced by conscious biases. And yet, while diminished, the implicit measure still revealed statistically significant differences in average personality between men and women, especially in relation to women scoring higher on Neuroticism and Agreeableness. In short, this result suggests that gender differences in personality are there at a subconscious level, but studies which relied on self-reporting may have overstated differences in gender, perhaps in part because people wanted to fit in with cultural expectations. The debate about the size of gender differences in personality doesn’t end there. While most large studies have tended to find the most consistent gender differences in the main traits of Neuroticism and Agreeableness, other scholars have pointed out there could be more extensive differences if only one were to look in more detail. Yanna Weisberg at Linfield College and her colleagues tested this possibility in 2011 by measuring what they called the two personality “aspects” for each of the Big Five traits (Extraversion, Neuroticism etc) in over 2,500 people. Extraversion, for example, comprises two aspects: enthusiasm and assertiveness, while Neuroticisms comprises volatility and withdrawal. Taking this approach, the researchers actually found gender differences for every one of the 10 aspects of personality that they looked at – women scored higher, on average, on enthusiasm, compassion, politeness, orderliness, volatility, withdrawal, and openness, while men scored higher on assertiveness, industriousness and intellect. The researchers said that these would not have shown up in studies at the level of the Big Five traits, as used in most earlier research. But Weisberg and her colleagues also cautioned that, while wide-ranging in terms of the number of characteristics, the gender differences they found were only “small to moderate”. This is consistent with the size of the gender differences uncovered by McCrae and others in their large cross-cultural studies, which also tended to be quite subtle. We hear a lot from pop psychologists and cultural commentators about men and women being like different species. In contrast, Weisberg and her team concluded that while gender differences in personality “might be important in shaping human experience and human culture, they are probably not so large as to preclude effective communication between men and women”. Marco Del Giudice’s research team from the University of Turin disagree. In 2012 they published a paper in which they claimed previous research had underestimated gender differences in personality by taking the average of all trait differences rather than viewing them cumulatively. In an email, Del Giudice explained his approach to me with an analogy. “Gender differences in personality are very much like gender differences in facial appearance,” he said. “Each individual trait (nose length, eye size, etc) shows small differences between men and women, but once you put them all together... differences become clear and you can distinguish between male and female faces with more than 95% accuracy.” By using this approach to study samples of over 10,000 men and women, Del Giudice and his colleagues documented gender-based differences in personality which they said were “extremely large by psychological standards”. They added that they believed their approach “made it clear that the true extent of sex differences in personality has been consistently underestimated”. What should we make of this bold claim? On his blog, statistician Andrew Gelman says that if you put aside the problems of interpreting the meaning of any observed differences between genders, then “their analysis seems like a good idea to me”. He added: “If you pick the dimensions in which men and women differ the most, you can find a large separation”. Other experts are less convinced. Janet Hyde – known for her work emphasising the similarities between men and women – says that Del Giudice and his colleagues had simply used a methodology designed to maximise differences and that the results were “uninterpretable”. While the debates about the size and causes of gender differences in personality are likely to rumble on for many more years, it seems reasonable to conclude that for whatever reason, there are at least some differences, however large or modest, in the personality of the average man and woman. But that word “average” is important – whichever study we choose to trust, there is plenty of overlap in personality between the genders. And remember that this is about personality, not all aspects of cognition and behaviour. Indeed, based on her review of gender differences across “across multiple psychological domains” Hyde has argued “that men and women are more similar than different; the distance between them is more like the distance between North Dakota and South Dakota [than the distance between planets]”. At the same time, it’s worth noting that there is more to this issue than gossip magazine tittle-tattle. There is increasing recognition of the part played by our personality traits in influencing our life choices and mental wellbeing. A better understanding of how men and women differ in personality, and why, could help create equal opportunity for all, as well as more effectively combat mental health problems, many of which affect one gender more than the other – like levels of depression being higher among women, consistent with their scoring higher on average in neuroticism. As Marco Del Giudice says, “researchers often stress the risk of overestimating gender differences, but the converse is just as true. Pretending that gender differences are smaller than they are deprives people of a very important piece of knowledge about themselves and others.” “For countless generations men have shaped women, women have shaped men, and here we are – the product of this amazing, complicated history. If we understand this, our judgment becomes broader and less superficial, whether we like the way we are or would like to change it.” -- Dr Christian Jarrett edits the British Psychological Society's Research Digest blog.

Volatility,The African lake with explosive power,2024-09-25,2020-10-16,John Wenz,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20201009-lake-kivu-the-african-lake-that-could-explode-with-methane,"In central Africa is a deep lake that has a dangerous propensity to explode – but tapping it as a source of energy could help avert disaster. Lake Kivu is one of Africa’s strangest bodies of water. An unusual set of properties make it an intriguing subject for scientists, as well as a potential source of both peril and prosperity for the millions of people living nearby. Kivu doesn’t behave like most deep lakes. Typically, when water at the surface of a lake is cooled – by winter air temperatures or rivers carrying spring snowmelt, for example – that cold, dense water sinks, and warmer, less dense water rises up from deeper in the lake. This process, known as convection, generally keeps the surfaces of deep lakes warmer than their depths. But at Lake Kivu, circumstances have conspired to block this mixing, giving the lake unexpected qualities – and surprising consequences. Straddling the border between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kivu is one of a string of lakes lining the East African Rift Valley where the African continent is being slowly pulled apart by tectonic forces. The resulting stresses thin the Earth’s crust and trigger volcanic activity, creating hot springs below Kivu that feed hot water, carbon dioxide and methane into the lake’s bottom layers. Microorganisms use some of the CO2, as well as organic matter sinking from above, to create energy, producing additional methane as a by-product. These gases would ordinarily bubble out of the water, but Kivu’s great depth – more than 460 metres (1,500ft) at its deepest point – creates so much pressure that they remain dissolved. This mixture of water and dissolved gases is denser than water alone, which discourages it from rising. The deeper water is also saltier due to sediment raining down from the upper layers of the lake and from minerals in the hot springs, which further increases the density. The result, says limnologist Sergei Katsev of the University of Minnesota Duluth, is a lake with several distinct layers of water of sharply different densities, with only thin transition layers between. You might also like: The layers can be separated roughly into two regions: one of less-dense surface water above a depth of about 60m (200ft) and, below that, a region of dense saline water that is itself further stratified, says Alfred Wüest, an aquatic physicist at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne. There is mixing within each layer, but they don’t interact with each other. “Just think of the entire water mass sitting there for thousands of years and doing nothing,” says Wüest, who has studied convection in various lakes of the world, including weird outliers like Lake Kivu. But Lake Kivu is more than just a scientific curiosity. Its unusual stratification and the CO2 and methane trapped in its deeper layers have researchers worried that it could be a disaster waiting to happen. Lurking danger About 1,400 miles (2,250km) north-west of Kivu, a crater lake in Cameroon known as Lake Nyos similarly accumulates and traps large amounts of dissolved gas – in this case CO2 – from a volcanic vent at the bottom of the lake. On 21 August 1986, the lethal potential of that gas reservoir was made tragically evident. Possibly due to a landslide, a large amount of water was suddenly displaced, causing the dissolved CO2 to mix rapidly with upper layers of the lake and release into the air. A large, deadly cloud of the gas asphyxiated an estimated 1,800 people in nearby villages. Events like this are called limnic eruptions, and scientists fear that Kivu may be ripe for a similar, even deadlier event. Nyos is a relatively small lake, measuring a little more than a mile long (1.6km), just under a mile wide and less than 210m (700ft) deep. Kivu is 55 miles (89km) long, 30 miles (48km) across at its widest point and more than twice as deep as Nyos. Because of its size, Katsev says, Kivu “has the potential for a major, catastrophic limnic eruption where many cubic miles of gas would be released”. About 14,000 people lived near Nyos at the time of the eruption. More than two million live in the vicinity of Lake Kivu today, including roughly one million residents of the city of Bukavu, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. If Kivu were to erupt, says limnologist Sally MacIntyre of the University of California, Santa Barbara, “it would be completely catastrophic”. This isn’t just a theoretical concern. Scientists have found what may be evidence of at least one previous limnic eruption at Kivu that likely occurred between 3,500 and 5,000 years ago, and possibly several more recent ones. Sediment cores taken from the bottom of the lake have revealed features known as brown layers that are unlike the surrounding sediments. These sediment bands are “very unusual, organic-rich layers”, Katsev says, that may be the result of eruptions. Limnic eruptions can occur for two reasons. If the water becomes completely saturated with dissolved gases, any additional CO2 or methane injected into the lake will be forced to bubble out of solution, rise and be released into the air. Eruptions can also be caused when something forces the deep water with its dissolved gases to mix with the layers above, reducing the pressure on the gases and allowing them to quickly come out of solution and escape, similar to the effect of shaking a can of soda and then opening it. While a landslide of the scale suspected in the Nyos eruption might not cause enough mixing at Kivu, due to the lake’s size and depth, there are several other possible triggers. Kivu is in a seismically active area, so an earthquake could generate waves in the lake that would mix the layers enough to release the trapped gases. Climate is also a potential culprit. At least one past eruption discovered in the sediment record appears to have been caused by drought that evaporated enough water from the top of the lake to reduce the pressure at the lower levels and release the dissolved gases. Lowered water levels during dry periods could also leave Kivu more vulnerable to disruption from particularly heavy rain. They could flush enough built-up sediment from the many streams feeding into the lake to cause the layers to mix, MacIntyre says. The chances of such a sequence of events may go up as the planet warms, MacIntyre says. Climate change is expected to bring more rain to East Africa, and “it’s going to come in the form of more extreme rain events with bigger intervals of drought in between”. Another possible trigger is volcanic activity under the lake or from surrounding volcanoes, but scientists think the risk of that is low. A 2002 eruption of nearby Mount Nyiragongo didn’t bring in enough material to disrupt Kivu’s bottom layers. And modelling studies have shown that volcanism below the lake wouldn’t cause a big enough disruption either, MacIntyre says. Whatever the cause of an eruption, the effect would be the same. Accumulated gases would be released from their dissolved state, creating dense clouds of CO2 and methane that, as happened with the CO2 at Nyos, could displace oxygen and lead to asphyxiation. And if enough methane were released into the air at Kivu, there is the additional risk that it could ignite. Katsev says that the lake is monitored regularly for signs of upticks in gas concentration, so a sudden upwelling “will not catch us by surprise”. More than a dozen seismic stations measure the activity near the lake in real time as well. And in 2001, an effort began to reduce the risk of another disaster at Nyos by siphoning water from the bottom of the lake through a pipe to the surface, where the CO2 is released into the air at a safe rate. Similar efforts are underway at Kivu. Mining the depths As gas concentrations rise in Kivu’s depths, so does the risk. Wüest and colleagues found that from 1974 to 2004 the concentration of CO2 increased by 10%. But the bigger concern at Kivu is the methane concentration, which rose 15-20% during the same period. There may be a way to turn Kivu’s risk into reward, though. The same gas that could fuel a deadly natural disaster has potential as an energy source for the region. In 2008, Rwanda launched a pilot programme taking methane from the lake to burn as a natural gas and last year signed a contract to export bottled methane. A much larger methane extraction programme, called KivuWatt, came online in 2015. The projects pump water from the deep layers of the lake, and as the pressure is reduced on that water, the gases are released. The methane is extracted to be used as fuel, and the CO2 is pumped back down to the bottom of the lake. “They take this gas, ship it via pipeline onshore and burn it the way you would burn fossil fuels to generate electricity,” Katsev says. For the people living in the lake’s vicinity, this could become an important source of energy. Once KivuWatt is fully online, the 100 megawatts of power produced by the project could make a significant difference for Rwanda, a developing country where only 35% of the population has access to electricity. Harvesting the Lake Kivu’s gases might help to reduce the risk from eruption, though it won’t eliminate it. Still, for a lake with that much danger lurking below, any reduction in risk is a valuable step. -- This article originally appeared in Knowable Magazine, and is republished here with permission. This is also why this story does not have an estimate for its carbon emissions, as Future Planet stories usually do.  -- Join one million Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.

Volatility,Electricity and sewerage bills rise with inflation,2024-09-25,2023-12-13,By Alex Blake,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-isle-of-man-67703434,"Electricity, sewerage and water bills are to rise in line with inflation on the Isle of Man, the chairman of Manx Utilities has confirmed. It follows Tynwald's backing of the firm's five-year pricing strategy being extended for a further 12 months.  The 5.7% inflationary rise in the sewerage rate from 1 April was also approved by politicians. Chairman John Wannenburgh said the rises were ""vital"" to enable investment in the services provided. The changes will see an average increase of £70 for electricity bills and £21 in the water rate for households each year. Those rises would generate an additional £5.6m and £1.1m in revenue for the government-owned utilities provider. The sewerage rate rise, which would be about £19 annually, was expected to raise another £800,000 in revenue, Mr Wannenburgh said. Manx Utilities set out its intention to implement that hike last month. For those with a septic tank, the cost of having it emptied is set to rise by £75 to £225. While Tynwald members voted to accept the increases, some MHKs expressed unease about them. Michelle Haywood said she was ""really uncomfortable"" basing utilities prices on a strategy from 2018, before major world events including the coronavirus pandemic and war in Ukraine had produced a ""seismic shift in the energy supply markets"".  A review of the authority's current pricing strategy, agreed by Tynwald in 2018, had been due to be completed by the start of the 2024-25 financial year.  But Mr Wannenburgh said it had been delayed due to the ""remaining volatility in wholesale markets"", and the extra time would allow for ""further stabilisation"" and any future reduction in costs. He said he and his predecessors had worked to ""shield"" Manx customers from the ""full increase in costs it has been facing from the energy crisis"".

Volatility,Is it worth joining the Bitcoin boom?,2024-09-25,2017-09-07,Chris Baraniuk,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20170906-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-latest-bitcoin-boom,"Crypto-currencies are soaring to market highs drawing in new investors – but some experts have concerns about the future. You may have noticed reports about Bitcoin’s value recently – its price is headed into the stratosphere. The crypto-currency’s recent meteoric price rise over the summer has seen one Bitcoin go from being worth $1,500 in early May to more than $5,000 over the weekend, before dropping to $4,654 at the time of publication. And that has got all kinds of people interested – people like Andrew Beckwith, a DJ who goes by the name Supersede. “I play restaurants, lounges, nightclubs, corporate events,” he says. You may also like: - Inside a secret Chinese Bitcoin mine - Loneliness often follows sudden wealth - Turning water into gold But he also invests. Beckwith has just taken his first step into the world of crypto-currencies, having converted $100 into Bitcoin. “I don’t know how far it’s going to grow,” he explains, “but if something is growing at hundreds of per cent, that’s a pretty valuable return.” Bitcoin is notorious for its volatility, but the recent peaks are unprecedented. In late 2013 its value jumped from around $100 to $1,000 – a bigger percentage increase – but it is worth more than four times that today. “Recently there’s been a lot more talk in the media and others have been investing,” explains Kiran Varughese, another amateur investor, who works for an elevator company in Dubai. A friend’s experiments with Bitcoin piqued his curiosity so he clubbed together with another pal to invest $1,000 in August. If they lose it, he says they won’t be too worried – the potential for a big return within the next few years is too tantalising for Varughese to resist. But are investors like Varughese and Beckwith taking too much of a risk by buying into Bitcoin, and other crypto-currencies like Ethereum, Litecoin or Dash? Is there something about these digital currencies that underpins their soaring prices or are they simply subject to whims in the market that can make fortunes but also devastate them? While the market capitalisation of all crypto-currencies now stands at $150 billion, they still occupy a strange space in the world of finance. “Every year Bitcoin continues to exist is something to take note of,” says Garrick Hileman, a research fellow at the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance at the University of Cambridge. “It’s a significant achievement for Bitcoin to have survived the many setbacks and challenges that it has faced.” One of these challenges occurred recently when Bitcoin split in two. It happened after the Bitcoin community became divided over how to allow more transactions to be processed with the currency. Because Bitcoin has no over-arching authority that controls it, any decision to alter the system that underpins it needed to gather enough support from Bitcoin users to go ahead. The system itself is called the blockchain – a huge digital ledger that records every single Bitcoin transaction in history. As computers on the Bitcoin network verify transactions, “blocks” of data are added to the ledger, storing this information. Computers that do this work receive a small sum of bitcoins as a reward – this is the process known as mining. Every single computer on the network has a copy of the blockchain and their copy of it is constantly updated. But until recently, Bitcoin blocks were limited in size to a megabyte every 10 minutes, meaning that the rate at which the blockchain could grow was capped. In early August, a new version of the crypto-currency – Bitcoin Cash – was mined for the first time. Its blocks can be up to eight megabytes in size. Some believe the smooth transition through this “fork” without any technical disasters has contributed to renewed confidence in Bitcoin, in turn helping to pump the price up. One “coin” of Bitcoin Cash is worth less, around $630 today, but that’s up $200 since its inception a month ago. Another fork to upgrade the block size further is expected in November and if successful, it might have a similar impact on Bitcoin’s buoyant price. But “currencies” like Bitcoin aren’t really playing the role of a traditional currency at the moment, says Vili Lehdonvirta, an economic sociologist at the Oxford Internet Institute, which is part of the University of Oxford. “When I called up a restaurant in Helsinki earlier this year to ask if they accept Bitcoin, the response was that they tried it a few years ago, nobody ever used it, and thus they no longer accept it,” he explains. BBC Capital contacted 10 businesses in London that have advertised an ability to accept Bitcoin in the past. Four of them said they had stopped accepting and two that did accept them reported hardly ever processing such payments. Instead, it appears many people are simply speculating on Bitcoin – investing in what is a relatively high-risk asset in the hope of a short-term gain in profit. But lucrative outcomes are by no means guaranteed – and many still think that Bitcoin is just a bubble. In the short-term there may be various reasons why people are buying in while the price is buoyant. Some may like investing in a currency unconnected to nation states, suggests Hileman. It could be seen as good insulation against uncertain political developments that can cause traditional currencies to plummet dramatically – as happened to the British pound in the aftermath of the Brexit vote. Volatile international disputes, such as those involving North Korea, could be driving people to put their money elsewhere. “If you’re in South Korea and you’re concerned about a geopolitical event, do you trade in the US dollar?” asks Hileman. “Maybe that’s not a great idea because the US will be involved, as will China and Japan, so it’s not surprising to see people look for alternative currencies,” he says. Applied cryptography consultant and Bitcoin-watcher Peter Todd says some are also attracted by Bitcoin’s independence for broader political reasons, too. In an uncertain world, people’s financial freedom is sometimes limited by their governments. Take India, which recently tried to curb public investments in gold as this was harming the nation’s economy. Bitcoin is a global entity, no one government can fiddle with it – although there are countries where trading it is illegal. Still, crypto-currencies remain associated with plenty of risks that go beyond their volatility. Many people store their bitcoins in online exchanges and should these be hacked or go bust, which has happened more than once, then the money is often lost forever. With all the technical ups and downs of crypto-currencies – their changes and potential to split into new currencies for example – there is also a significant degree of complexity that can leave less informed investors bewildered. A new area of excitement, known as initial coin offerings (ICOs), are also beginning to worry some experts. ICOs allow owners of crypto-currencies to invest in fledgling companies, with many using Ethereum as their digital coin of choice. However, ICOs have already been associated with a number of scams and hacks, and China just banned them, calling ICOs 'illegal fundraising'. “I think the main thing we’re seeing in ICOs is straight-up fraud,” says Todd. He is concerned about efforts by regulators to clamp down on this because such an approach could backfire and encourage scammers to become more sophisticated. “It’s when things look legit that they get dangerous,” he says, pointing out that a few years ago Bitcoin and other digital tokens had more of a “Wild West” feel to them, which perhaps meant people were less likely to be duped since scams were crude and easy to spot. As more and more investors get involved in crypto-currencies, scams can get slicker and the natural wariness that can keep people cautious may also diminish. Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies are gradually cementing their stated position – providing a radical new alternative to the investment options that existed before them. But there is no certainty as to how this massive experiment will play out. Though when did that ever stop hopeful investors taking a punt?

Volatility,Ambitious Aussies take the wheel,2024-09-25,2016-01-05,Phil Mercer,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20151222-meet-australias-new-go-it-alone-investors,"It’s not for the faint-hearted, going solo with your life savings. But in search of a more prosperous retirement, that’s exactly what two million Australians have decided to do. They’ve taken matters in to their own hands, ditching traditional professional investment services in favour of (either completely or partially) running their pension plans by themselves. They’re hoping to hit the jackpot: a comfortable retirement. To be sure, taking this kind of risk may offer big rewards but the downside can be devastating. There’s some indication that what’s happening down under could be the start of a wider global trend for self-directed retirement savings. Government measures, known as “pension freedoms” came into force in Britain in April 2015 giving individual a lot more control over their retirement cash.   The number of go-it-alone investors in Australia has been climbing over the last decade, according to Lisa Greig, from Taxpayers Australia, a nonprofit organisation representing tax accountants and small businesses. Official statistics show self-managed funds now account for almost a third of all superannuation, or pension, nest-eggs in Australia. A decade ago that figure stood at just 10%. The reason? Australia’s ageing population and rising living costs are putting huge pressure on household budgets, (as people live longer lives they still need to accumulate enough savings to pay for food, utilities, insurance.) In addition, more Australians want a greater say in how their finances are managed. These self-funded retirees believe they can get better returns by spreading their money between assets such as property, debentures (debt products issued by large firms) vintage cars or even fine art, in addition to stocks. Large pension funds don’t offer investors this breadth of investments and often rely more heavily on equities performance to generate returns. While the majority of Australians trust their retirement income to funds run by specific companies or industries (education and health care account for 19% of the superannuation market), or retail funds managed by financial institutions or the insurance sector (around 28% of all superannuation), doing it yourself is clearly not for everyone. Those taking the plunge must be financially literate and willing to do their research, Greig said. “It comes down to the effort you want to put in,” she explained. “You’ve got to put the training in if you want to run a marathon, well, you’ve got to put the training in if you want to get the right result from your self-managed superannuation fund. The buck stops with you so you’ve got to take that responsibility.” Tim Harcourt, an economist at the University of New South Wales Business School said, “The main pitfall is you have to do the administration yourself and be more vigilant in watching the markets — instead of sitting back and letting the professionals do it for you. It’s not necessarily more risky — self-managed super funds (SMSF) have been performing well compared to industry and retail funds but you have to be engaged and have a good grasp of financial information to be successful.” Pensions deconstructed Australia has various provisions for those approaching old age. Most people over the age of 65 are entitled to an age-pension, which is means-tested and they don’t have to contribute to. Designed as a measure to prevent poverty, about a quarter of retirees aren’t eligible to receive the benefit because they are too wealthy. In 1990 Australia introduced a compulsory pre-funded pension plan called superannuation, a scheme that employers must pay in to on behalf of their workers. Those contributions currently equate to 9.5% of an employee’s wage, this will likely rise to near 12% by July 2025. The scheme was created by the government to provide the country’s ageing and longer-living population with a decent income in retirement. It’s a similar structure to schemes run in Chile and Sweden. Compulsory superannuation, introduced more than 25 years ago, has thrown up new challenges for retirees. Never before have so many older Australians had the opportunity to shape their financial futures. Since the compulsory system came into effect the superannuation industry has amassed funds worth more than A$1tn (US$717.8bn), and laws allowing self-managed funds handed over power to Australians that previous generations never had. In their own hands These self-funded retirees say caution is key and a clear long-term strategy and an aversion to unnecessary risk are crucial. A sense of calm is needed, too. Arnie Bates, who migrated from Britain in 1985, said it has been important to learn not to panic. “You must not be too nervous when things go the wrong way in the market,” Bates said. “Yeah, you win some, you lose some. On average we are ahead but at the moment to make more than the cost of living is very, very hard and it is pushing a lot of retirees into risky investments, unfortunately.” Bates, in his late 60s, retired after a long career in the textile, footwear and clothing industry in 2011. It was a five-year stint working in Indonesia that convinced him that he had the knowledge and confidence to take control of his money in retirement. Bates said he holds at least two year’s worth of living expenses in cash to weather downturns in the stock market. Not everyone is so fortunate or so savvy. For those who want to learn more about investing, the Australian Tax Office offers advice to retirees, while information services such as the Eureka Report and professional financial advisers offer guidance. The risks For many investors, the thought of handling their own finances may fill them with fear. “The real risk is people taking control of their [superannuation] funds without any formal or appropriate advice, and thinking they know a little bit about everything, which is dangerous,” explained Jason Sourasis, managing director of Strategic Financial group, which encourages self-managed portfolios for Australians with funds only in excess of A$500,000 (US$360,000). In Australia, many retirees who go solo with their finances hand-pick an advisor to help them navigate through a complex maze of regulations and rules, and tax legislation that can be hard for outsiders to follow. “A lot of people probably take [on] too much risk at the wrong times not knowing anything about the investment markets or the volatility that comes with different asset classes,” Sourasis told BBC Capital. Professor John Piggott from the University of New South Wales Business School worries that some self-funded retirees might find themselves out of their depth. “It is not a responsibility that previous generations have faced. That contributes to its lack of familiarity amongst people of this age and its scariness.  It leads to a lot of apprehension and, in some cases, very poor decision-making,” he said. Successes and failures Neville Daynes, a former school principal in Melbourne, says his portfolio, which comprises cash accounts, property and shares, incurs accounting and audit costs of less than 1%, well below the 2.5% charged by larger institutions. Daynes says he is organised and stays on top of his paperwork.  Like fellow retiree Arnie Bates, he takes a cautious approach and says he never holds more than 5% of his portfolio in any one share or investment. “There were a couple of times when I got hit during the credit squeeze …,” said Daynes. “It takes quite a bit of work and you have to work on a strategy, so it is not for everybody.” Though taking the driving seat is an increasing popular approach to retirement planning, there are horror stories. A decade ago, Kerry Koliadis, an immigrant from Greece, retired after a 44-year career in the cardboard-box making industry. After seeing friends and colleagues lose money in the stock market, the 74-year old retiree from Sydney ploughed most of his retirement money into the local taxi industry, buying licences that allow him to run taxi services. Koliadis said competition from ride sharing service Uber has had a catastrophic effect.  “I bought three taxi licences for approximately A$250,000 (US$179,000) each but now the price has dropped by more than A$100,000 (US$72,000) each,” he explained. “This is not the right thing for somebody in retirement to face, and I say my prayers, my friend.” To comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Capital, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter."
Volatility,Twitter pop? Know this about IPOs,2024-09-25,2014-11-03,Constance Gustke,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20131106-pop-goes-the-ipo-or-does-it,"The eagerly anticipated Twitter initial public offering debuts on the New York Stock Exchange Thursday.  Amid excitement and demand for the shares, the social network has already boosted its estimate of the shares’ value by 25% — a signal to some that IPOs are again heating up in the United States as investors look for fresh, potentially high-growth stocks.     According to real-time information provider Dealogic, 190 IPOs have listed on US stock markets so far this year and most saw their share price rise on the first day of trading. Container Store shares, for instance, rose 101% the day they began trading 1 November. IPOs in Europe, mainly in the UK, have also been strong as markets there rebound. Royal Mail, a UK postal service company, rose 38% on the first day of trading on the London Stock Exchange, although most first-day pops among European IPO stocks are more muted. “Everyone is trying to find the next great IPO performer,” says Jim Krapfel, an equity strategist at investment research firm Morningstar.  “When people clamour for company shares, though, the deal is more likely overhyped.”  That’s one big reason why experts say it is often better for average investors to avoid the siren call of the next hot IPO — at least at the start. What’s more, big institutional investors may get the bulk of the available shares for popular offerings and have access to more up-to-date financial information than do individual investors. Buying a first-day IPO can be fool’s gold, say some experts, since many fall after a brief rise. Prosensa Holding NV, a Dutch biotech company, popped 48% its first day on the Nasdaq exchange in late June. Since then, the company’s shares have dropped 72%, according to Dealogic data. “IPOs are meant to pop the first day,” explained John Edmunds, a professor of finance at Babson College in Massachusetts. The danger, though, is that a fast start means that future growth is already priced into the stock and investors who buy early on may end up seeing their sure thing turn into a disappointment. Wait and see Part of the IPO allure is getting in on the ground floor of owning a company. The day an IPO starts trading, investors are finally able to buy stock in companies that have usually been held only by private investors. Those private investors have often invested tens of millions in the fledging firm but don’t usually like to have their money tied up forever. Plus, they want to rake in the profits they’ve been waiting for. Most IPOs allow those early investors — and employees who are granted shares before the IPO as incentive or compensation — to sell their stock after a few months. When they do, it almost always drags down the price of the stock because so many shares are coming into the open market at once, according to Robert Emens, a principal at GW & Wade Asset Management Company in Palo Alto, California. “In reality, you’re coming in on something like the fifth floor,” explained Brian Hamilton, chairman of Sageworks, which analyses private company financials. “Other parties have almost always invested earlier at lower prices. You could be late to the party.” If you’re really keen on owning a stock, “wait to buy when others aren’t looking”, said Krapfel. That is usually at least 25 days after an offering is listed.    Behind the curtain Gauging a company’s true, non-hyped IPO value can be hard to do. Newly public companies lack a long-term track record of revenue or profits, and have no analyst ratings to help investors compare the firm to any benchmark. Huge, hotly-anticipated offerings of big names like Facebook — and even Twitter — are more likely to be significantly overpriced compared to the actual value of the firm more than some other IPOs, Edmunds said. Coltish IPOs are also more volatile during the first two years they’re listed. “IPOs can also get slammed 30% in one day,” said William Smith, chief executive officer at Renaissance Capital in Greenwich, Connecticut. That high volatility can impact future performance. According to a study by the University of Florida, IPOs issued between 2000 and 2011 underperformed similar firms by 18% the first year and 6.3% the second. Five years later, however, that gap was nearly erased as the firms became more established and built a smoother track record.  Despite the early price pop effect, today’s IPOs are still better quality — sporting better revenues and stronger profits — than companies that debuted during the dot-com era. “Back then, there was a feeding frenzy,” said Edmunds. Several company IPOs rose over 100% their first day of trading, and some didn’t even have positive cash flow at their IPO. That’s also the case with Twitter, which is one reason experts say investors should be cautious. These days, investors are counselled to look for two essential IPO ingredients: revenue growth and profitability.  These ingredients help buoy an IPO’s stock price after the early excitement wears off. For example, Chipotle Mexican Grill, which was profitable before going public in 2006, is now trading at $543 per share. Its stock debuted at $22 per share.    Remember, the stock market punishes companies — even big, exciting, next-best-thing ones — if they can’t sustain or produce earnings. When couponer Groupon went public in 2011, it wasn’t profitable and still isn’t. Shares now hover 50% below their offering price, said Hamilton. As for Twitter, the company isn’t making money and recent reports about the decline in the number of new users worries onlookers. “Growth might be slowing,” said Edmunds. “So what are investors really being offered?” Edmunds asked.

Volatility,The CEOs of tomorrow,2024-09-25,2013-10-18,Unknown,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20131017-the-ceos-of-tomorrow,"What does US National Football League star quarterback Peyton Manning have in common with the best chief executives of today and the future? Is it intelligence? The ability to command a room? To think fast on his feet? It may be all of the above. What it takes to be a leader — and what future executive suites may look like — was a topic several LinkedIn Influencers weighed in on this week, from quarterback-as-CEO to the end of the white, male executive to the future of women in the upper echelons of corporations. Here is what some of them had to say. Gary Burnison, Chief Executive Officer at Korn/Ferry International Peyton Manning, quarterback for the NFL’s Denver Broncos has been “flawless so far this season. He and his team find a way to win,” wrote Burnison in his post Peyton Manning Would Make an Even Better CEO. His stats speak for themselves: He has thrown 20 touchdowns in the five games that have been played this season and has a 150-70 win-loss record over his 15 seasons of play. “At any leadership level, like President, CEO, or sports figure — the great leaders rise above and represent the team more than themselves. Leaders demonstrate that they are in charge and in control. And part of being in charge is their belief they will overcome the odds and win — and they do,” Burnison wrote.  “Much of this is driven by their aura of confidence, a presence that permeates the culture. This is apparent in Peyton Manning’s deep belief that he and his team will make it.” So what might Manning look like as a CEO? “In running a business, he would have the company ahead of projections month after month. He would anticipate issues and adjust the company to a changing environment — like calling an audible at the line of scrimmage,” Burnison wrote. Manning has one characteristic in particular which is becoming increasingly important for leaders. That trait is “learning agility”. “Learning agility is the willingness and ability to learn from experience and then apply those lessons to succeed in new situations,” wrote Burnison. “Leaders who are learning agile continuously seek new challenges, solicit direct feedback, self-reflect, and get jobs done resourcefully.” Steve Tappin, Chief Executive Officer at Xinfu, host of BBC CEO Guru Are the days of the white male chief executive coming to an end? That’s the question Tappin addressed in his post End of Days For White, Male, Stale CEOs? His answer: a resounding yes. “We are about to witness an unprecedented leadership shift over the next decade,” Tappin wrote. “Expect a transformation: the two-thirds of Western CEOs who are really professional managers — incrementally optimising their companies around the short-term — will go. They’ll be leapfrogged by a new breed of CEOs running on an emerging market fuel, powered by dreams, entrepreneurship, innovation and belief.” One need only look at market predictions about global companies to get a sense of why, he wrote. “According to a new report from McKinsey Global Institute, Urban World: The Shifting Global Business Landscape, an amazing 70% of the predicted 88% growth in large companies between now and 2025 will come from the emerging markets.” “Where will future leaders come from, and what will this mean for the white, male-dominated elite currently running the show in America and Europe?,” asked Tappin. “I believe that we will see a rise of global entrepreneurs building sustainable value.”   Where will these new CEOs come from? Tappin pointed to the BRICs — the block of emerging market countries comprised of Brazil, Russia, India and China. “The BRIC countries all have their challenges, but they could be set to turn these to their advantage. Their entrepreneurs are more likely to have suffered hardship in their upbringing, and don’t underestimate their driving determination to secure a legacy for their families, future generations and their country,” he wrote.  “Their companies are often younger, and a stronger family orientation can mean that, like the South Koreans and Japanese who rose before them, they are able to set their time horizon over the longer term.” Sallie Krawcheck, former head of Merrill Lynch and Smith Barney With her investment in women’s networking group 85 Broads, Krawcheck has become outspoken on the lack of women in executive and board roles. Now, she wrote in her post What Winning Companies Get… And Others Won’t, “We are in a bull market for advice to women on how to get ahead in their companies.” “Smart companies…are recognising that the inherent differences among genders and cultures are not things to be fixed, but are instead sources of strength. It is exactly these differences that drive the higher returns, lower volatility and greater innovation that accrue to more diverse companies,” Krawcheck wrote. What will this look like? Krawcheck wrote that “smart companies will embrace and draw on these differences… They will change their evaluation systems to eliminate “cascading bias,” in which the qualities of the existing (typically white, male) leadership team are reinforced and other types of skills are undervalued.” By doing this, more women will reach higher levels and executive roles. “It won’t happen quickly. But companies that don’t take this action will increasingly lose out,” Krawcheck wrote.

Volatility,China’s wine hangover,2024-09-25,2014-02-20,Rob Budden,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20140220-chinas-wine-hangover,"Understanding wine funds There are around a dozen or so specialist wine funds worldwide which can be bought and sold through brokers or direct. You’ll pay a one-off subscription charge of around 5% and funds charge annual management fees — typically between 1.5% and 2% of your total investment― for access. Some funds also charge performance fees of about 20% of any gains above a set return, typically 6% per annum. While a fund diversifies the investments in types of wine, which can lower volatility, some risks remain. Some funds, most notably the Vintage Wine fund in the Cayman Islands, have been forced to close down after a spate of redemptions by investors. This fund peaked at over 100m euro ($137 m) and was invested heavily in Burgundy wines but is now liquidating its portfolio. Funds that adopt an open-ended structure, which means the fund's size expands or contracts depending on whether investors are buying or selling, are most at risk. Rapid sales by investors can shrink the fund so much that annual management charges no longer cover the fixed costs of running the fund.  Is 2014 the year wine merchants and investors are finally able to snap up bargain bottles of excellent vintages? It’s a question many are asking after what wine market experts describe as a clear plateau for prices. Fine wine prices are still reeling from Chinese buyers souring on the market. Those buyers and others across southeast Asia helped lift prices to record highs back in late 2008. But since then, the market has experienced its toughest period on record, with traded prices―typically cases of wine― falling for a third consecutive year. According to London-based data analysis firm, Liv-ex, which tracks wine prices for professional investors around the globe, the market fell 15% in 2011, followed by a 9% decline in 2012. Although in 2013, the market saw only a 1.4% dip. The fine wine market, estimated to be worth several billion dollars annually, remains dominated by the big household names ―Bordeaux, Burgundy and Champagne― and attracts both drinkers and investors. Indeed wine analysts say how important both consumption and investment demand are in driving prices up or down. While the attractions for consumers are obvious, what draws investors in to the sector are a history of double digit returns and another way of diversifying their investments. Chateau Lafite Rothschild was the poster child of this China boom with even “poor vintages” soaring to around £8,000 ($13,000) a case from around £2,500 ($4,125) before the Chinese started entering the market in 2008, according to Justin Gibbs, co-founder of Liv-ex. Prices paid by an investor today for similar vintages have now settled back to around £5,000 ($8,250) a case, he said. Even so, over the last 30 years wine has produced 12% compound annual returns according to Liv-ex. “Ultimately wine is a play on global growth,” said Gibbs. “As people get richer they consume more fine wine.” With global wealth generally on the rise, wine analysts expect prices to resume their upward trend later in 2014. Even so, that trend will be fuelled not by Chinese investors. Few expect the Chinese to return in their droves – many stopped buying in mid 2011 put off by a proliferation of fake wines filtering through to the market and the beginnings of a crackdown on giving wine as corporate gifts by a new government. Wine experts say the next big buyers of fine wine will likely come from India, Africa or possibly even South America. In previous decades, when major regions entered the fine wine market it led to a bull-run for prices. Buyers from the United States in the 1960s and '70s helped send prices up around six-fold in the 15 years to 1975.And from the beginning of the 1990s to the peak of the market in October 1997, buyers from Japan helped usher in more dramatic price increases of around 24%annually. Buying smart There are two primary ways of investing in wine: buying actual cases or bottles and storing them until sale or simply putting money into wine funds. Fine wine expert Matthew Tipping of London-based wine merchant Berry Brothers and Rudd said investors who buy wine directly should ensure that it is stored professionally to maintain its value (you will pay, typically, £12 to £15 or $20 to $25 per year, to store a case). Look for a wine merchant with a long history and ensure the wine is stored in your own name, offering protection for the investment should the merchant go bust. Tipping also recommends buying and holding full cases; selling individual bottles can significantly reduce value. Also, keep in mind you will also incur transaction costs (private buyers will typically face spreads of 10% to15% on sought after wine cases, even higher on less mainstream stock). The main exit routes for investors are selling via auction or through a merchant or wine broker. For those looking to buy wine to store and later sell, the key is choosing the right region, maturity, vintage and wine grower, according to wine fund managers and analysts. Wine funds can offer the advantage that they allow people with more modest sums to invest a greater diversification across vintages, regions and growers and hence less volatile performance. These investors also gain access to an investment professional who is constantly monitoring prices and selecting wines they hope will outperform the wider market. Tipping, of Berry Brothers — which has traded wine since 1698 — said that 18 months ago, around 90% of the investing and trading market was purely in Bordeaux wines. The remainder was made up largely of Champagnes, Burgundies and so-called 'Super Tuscans', a label for more forward thinking wines from the Chianti region, said Tipping, which means the producers adopt more flexible rules for blending wine varieties and grapes. Today Bordeaux trading has fallen to just 78% of the entire market for trading as investors have switched to other varieties such as Burgundy, according to Liv-ex. This is an unusually low figure and has seen Bordeaux prices sink 30% from their peak in June 2011. Some wine investors, however, predict this year could see Bordeaux return to favour, opening an opportunity for savvy buyers. This type of volatility is problematic, though, for the average investor, and highlights the risks of wine investing in the medium term, although many wine experts continue to extol the virtues of the asset class as a longer-term diversification tool for conventional share and bond investment portfolios. Over shorter periods of two to three years or less, wine as an asset class displays remarkable correlation with stock markets according to Liv-ex's Gibbs. Since 2011, fine wines have closely tracked the Shanghai Composite index for example, China's main equity benchmark, Gibbs added. While wine has displayed an even closer correlation with Japanese equities, said Chris Smith, investment manager at the London-based Wine Investment fund, which holds around $50m of stock. Since 2008, wine prices have closely tracked Japan's Nikkei stock market index, he said, with only small signs of diversion over the last year. This close correlation may be a sign of the country's continued influence on the fine wine market globally. After the UK, Japan remains one of the biggest buyers of fine wines in the world and Tokyo has more Michelin-starred restaurants than London, Paris and New York combined, Smith said. Some investors are betting that quantitative easing initiatives in the UK, US and Japan, will herald a return to inflation and could also impact wine pricing. They believe global markets are yet to feel the full force of the extra dollars pumping extra liquidity in to the economy which could lead to a delayed reaction and the return of inflation. At which point inflation-busting asset classes such as gold – and wine – would likely return to favour. While a nightmare for central bankers, this scenario would likely favour fine wines “starting investors looking to inflation proof assets,” Smith says. Gibbs of Liv-ex is full of optimism on the wine market, but he said it might take longer for other merchants to feel safe investing in the market in a big way again. Many wine investors are still licking their wounds following the sharp correction experienced over the last few years. Gibbs concedes: “you won't find many optimistic merchants out there”."
Volatility,Market madness: Mind your money,2024-09-25,2014-11-03,Vikram Barhat,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20140717-market-madness-mind-your-money,"A shaky global economy and jittery stock indices are making investors nervous these days. Having barely recovered from a sharp decline on 10 July amid concerns about the financial health of Portuguese lender Banco Espirito, the focus of world’s stock markets has now shifted to record high stock prices and economic weakness in North America, of which the US Federal Reserve warned on Tuesday and the Bank of Canada on Wednesday. Though this hasn’t triggered a sustained rout in global equities, money managers across the developed world are taking this opportunity to warn investors that markets in North America have been building toward an inevitable slump and that they should brace themselves for as much as a 20% plunge. A sharp decline of between 5% to 20% or more, called a “correction” in market parlance, would be completely normal given that it’s been nearly three years since the last major pullback, said David Rosenberg, chief economist and strategist at Canadian wealth management firm Gluskin Sheff and Associates Inc. “In terms of how big a correction, I would say between 5% and 10%,” he said adding that “in this historic period of ultra-low volatility, it will feel more like 20%.” Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Harris Bank in Chicago has been predicting a similar downdraft in the US equity market. “A correction is entirely possible, certainly from a valuation perspective [for] the S&P is trading at about 25% above its median price-to-sales ratio” he argued. “A 10% correction isn't out of the question. All major equity markets could be susceptible to a correction.” An eye on global economies The view from Europe isn’t any better. Jason Hollands, managing director of business development and communications at Bestinvest Ltd brokerage in London has been urging caution for some months. “The US market looks particularly expensive,” Hollands said. “The extreme levels of money printing in recent years by the US Federal Reserve and other central banks, combined with ultra-low interest rates, has turbocharged markets and inflated asset prices.” Globally, central banks have embarked on a journey that will eventually result in more “normal” monetary policy. The Bank of England ended its own Quantitative Easing (asset purchase programme) in 2012, while the Fed has been scaling back its stimulus since the start of this year. As well, leaders of the world’s most important central banks, including Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, and Janet Yellen, head of the US Federal Reserve have been indicating interest rates could start to rise again soon. Higher interest rates could hurt many S&P 500 companies whose earnings growth in recent years has come, predominantly, from the ability to refinance debt very cheaply. Hollands said these are indications that “some steam coming out of the pressure cooker is a possibility.” He doesn’t see a stock market crash deeper than 10% but said “when a wild party comes to an end, it'll leave some with a hangover.” A set of triggers Triggers for a drastic market correction — such as an interest rate shock and steep stock prices in the US, overheated housing market in Canada, geopolitical events in the Middle East and Ukraine, economic slowdown in emerging markets, and fears of recession in Europe — are all there, yet market volatility (a measure of how widely prices swing) has been eerily low, said Hollands. “This feels like there’s too much complacency,” he said. “You could think of it as the calm before the storm.” Increased interconnectedness within key global markets means that the meltdown will likely spill over into other regions, regardless of where it begins. “There's a saying that when America sneezes, the rest of the world catches a cold,” said Hollands. “Were the US market to experience a slide, you might see contagion to other exchanges.” Similarly, the Greek debt crisis and fears of hard landing in China in the recent past showed that a macroeconomic event can have a knock-on effect on financial markets far from its epicenter. “All major equity markets could be susceptible to a correction,” said Ablin but asserted that “US small caps appear to be among the most precariously positioned markets now, due to their high valuations.” Small capitalisation stocks are companies that have revenue of more than $300m but less than $2bn. These companies, said Rosenberg, have been selling for 20 times their earnings versus the historic average of 15 times. Large-cap stocks, companies that are larger than $10bn, have been selling for 15.5 times their earnings relative to the long run average of 13.5 times, he added. At biggest risk When US investors panic, they have a tendency to sell the assets they hold overseas and bring their cash home. That means that emerging markets, including Mexico, Turkey and Indonesia, are often the first casualty. Currently, emerging markets appear calm, but Hollands said trouble could be brewing underneath the surface. “The big risk remains in China,” said Hollands. “Its economic growth rate is slowing, but it has only scratched the surface so far in terms of its need to rebalance its economy away from construction and infrastructure investment and towards the consumer.” Yet in India, the other key member of the economic bloc, positive macroeconomic data and political developments have kept the market buoyed. Bengaluru, India-based Kunal Kumar Kundu, vice president and India economist at French financial firm Societe Generale doesn’t foresee a meaningful decline in India. “The Indian equity market is close to be fairly valued and offers a compelling story supported by relatively high growth and a strong government,” he said. “[India’s new] government is expected to usher in some much-desired reform measures. Within the emerging markets space, India looks a safe bet.” But things can change pretty quickly in emerging markets. Rosenberg said markets that bear the brunt during turbulent times are generally those that are the riskiest and have the highest beta — a measure of a stock’s risk relative to the overall market. “I would expect emerging markets to suffer the most in a downdraft,” he added. Andrew Hamlin, vice president and portfolio manager at Aston Hill Asset Management Inc in Toronto said if history repeats itself, a sell-off could be closer than we think. “Summer months are traditionally slower months for the equity market and August is usually a dreadful month for investors,” he said. “Equity markets in the last three of four years in August have been down months with the smallest down being about 3%. We’re heading into that so there could very well be a sell-off in the market.” If the correction is sparked by a rate shock or an economic setback, “the sectors most vulnerable would likely be financials, homebuilders, utilities and capital goods,” Rosenberg said. Ablin said when equity markets tumble, the momentum sectors — lead by technology and consumer discretionaries — could suffer more than others due to a colossal bubble in asset prices. What should investors do? It’s time for investors to rebalance their portfolios not just to weather the storm by taking some risk off the table, but also to strategically ramp up or down certain weightings, said Hamlin. Now, he asserted, is a prime time for investors to take a good look at their holdings. “If you’ve got some big winners in your portfolio, take some gains by selling them,” he urged. “Don’t be afraid to build a war chest of cash, so when a correction does occur you’re able to buy back your favourite names at cheaper prices.” Investors should take time to build a shopping list of stocks or bonds they want to own when they get cheaper as a result of market spasms, he added. As for stock selection, Rosenberg said to focus on high-quality companies with earnings visibility. “We are moving through an era of deflation to reflation to inflation, so I would be hedged by having exposure to energy, gold and basic materials in general,” he said. When markets fall, investors tend to flee to larger, dividend-generating companies with robust balance sheets. “These are safe-haven blue-chip stocks such as utility companies and tobacco firms,” Hollands said.  This story was produced under the BBC's guidelines for financial journalism.

Volatility,How busyness leads to bad decisions,2024-09-25,2019-12-02,Brigid Schulte,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20191202-how-time-scarcity-makes-us-focus-on-low-value-tasks,"When we’re under pressure our mental bandwidth narrows – and that means we focus on the wrong tasks. So what’s the remedy for unproductive ‘tunnelling’? With offices closed in nations around the world, many of us are grappling with how to stay productive and on task as we work from home. To help provide insight on how to manage this, BBC Worklife is updating some of our most popular productivity stories from our archive. Let’s see if this sounds familiar: You churn through the day at work under deadline pressure, racing to meetings, dashing off emails, feeling busy, purposeful and a little breathless. Yet as the end of the traditional workday draws near, you realise with a sinking feeling that you haven’t even begun the big project you meant to tackle that day. So you bring work home, or decide not to and can’t stop feeling guilty about it. Either way, your work is spilling over into the rest of your life, stealing time and mental bandwidth away from family or rest or fun, and leaving you feeling exhausted and a little resentful. You resolve that tomorrow will be different. But come morning, you inevitably find yourself back on the treadmill of busyness. That’s a pattern Antonia Violante has seen a lot at workplaces she’s been studying in the United States for a project on work-life balance. Behavioural scientists and researchers like her call it “tunnelling”. When we’re stressed and feeling pressed for time, Violante explains, our attention and cognitive bandwidth narrow as if we’re in a tunnel. It can sometimes be a good thing, helping us hyper-focus on our most important work. But tunnelling has a dark side. When we get caught up in a time scarcity trap of busyness, a panicked firefighting mode, we might only have the capacity to focus on the most immediate, often low-value tasks right in front of us rather than the big project or the long-range strategic thinking that would help keep us out of the tunnel in the first place. “We see people end up tunnelling on the wrong thing,” she says. Why email offers false rewards Email certainly falls under that category. To Violante, a senior associate at ideas42, a non-profit firm with offices across the US and in New Delhi that uses behavioural science to solve real-world problems, email is the perfect addictive “attention slot machine”. Our brains are wired for novelty, so we actually love being interrupted with every random ping and ding of a new message. And humans enjoy feeling busy and productive. Combine time scarcity with that pull of novelty and our busyness craving and it’s easy to see how we end up focusing our time and attention on whatever’s right in front of us, which, these days, is email.   Busy-loving humans have such an aversion to idleness, in fact, that one study found people preferred giving themselves electric shocks rather than have nothing to do. “So it’s easy to be swept up trying to keep on top of your email inbox,” Violante says. “It allows us to be busy, which feels good. But it leads to a false reward.” Like mistaking busyness for productivity. To get out of that particular busyness tunnel, Violante suggests experimenting with checking mail on a schedule. That idea, which Violante herself has adopted, is based on research that found smokers given a smoking schedule had greater success quitting than through other methods. The reason, researchers surmised, is that a schedule not only gave people practice and confidence in not smoking, but also broke the link between habitual smoking cues and actually lighting up. A similar idea holds true for email: a 2015 study found that people who check their email on a schedule felt happier and less stressed out than those who checked constantly – which many of us do, spending about five hours a day nosing about our inboxes.   Violante also suggests that teams set communication protocols for when a response is expected and agree to send emails out only during work hours. To preserve mental bandwidth, she recommends an email mindset shift. “It’s not about having, literally, zero emails in your inbox, but having no ambiguity about what’s in there and having a plan for what’s most important to respond to,” she explains. Though she recognises it’s not easy. “Even behavioural scientists have addiction problems with email.” How scarcity shrinks mental bandwidth The concepts of scarcity and tunnelling were first described in behavioural science research on poverty. Anandi Mani, a professor of behavioural economics at the Blavatnik School of Government at Oxford, and her colleagues wanted to understand what led poor people to make bad choices with their money, such as borrowing at high interest rates or playing the lotto, that can keep them trapped in poverty. They studied sugar cane farmers in India, and gave them cognitive tests both when the farmers were flush with money right after harvest and when, months later, money was scarce. The researchers found that scarcity itself created such a tax on mental bandwidth that the farmers’ IQ tests dropped 13 points between flush and scarce times. “There is a direct parallel between scarcity of money and scarcity of time,” Mani says. “With money, we do what’s urgent – we pay this bill, we try to make the budget work, even when we know it’s more important to take time to be a good parent or talk to your mom. At work, it’s the same. We get captured by whatever’s in front of our face, and we don’t give ourselves the space or introspection to think about what might be more meaningful to do.” To step out of the time scarcity tunnel, Mani suggests first becoming aware of how you may be trapped in busyness. If you can, you might try smoothing your workload or spreading it out over time, much like research on how income smoothing helps those with money scarcity better weather financial volatility and keep from falling into episodic poverty. Then work with others to create and enforce group norms around taking breaks – at work, during the week, at the weekend.   “The old rules – you don’t work on the Sabbath – creating forced slack in our schedules, has real value,” Mani says. She herself is experimenting with 15 minutes of meditation every morning. “It’s making me more aware during the day,” she says. “Honestly, this is a topic which pushes me to a lot of soul searching.” Plan your time with greater care Anuj Shah, a professor of behavioural science at the University of Chicago, says scarcity creates its own mindset. His research, in which participants played online games and were either “rich” or “poor” in the number of guesses or attempts allowed, was surprising. Those who were “poor” were actually much more accurate or careful with their resources. But because scarcity narrowed their bandwidth, they were so focused on the current round, they were unable to strategise about the future and made disastrous choices, like borrowing at exorbitant rates, that wound up costing them dearly.   So to keep from tunnelling on the wrong thing or neglecting important tasks that seem less urgent at the moment but will pay greater dividends in the long run, Shah says, people need to recognise that time and bandwidth are limited resources and begin to think of choices around them as trade-offs. For instance, he says, when we look at our calendar six months from now, it often appears wide open and free of all commitments. So we can overcommit ourselves, which can lead to more time scarcity and tunnelling in the future. “But we know that in six months, that week is going to look a lot like this week, which is usually pretty busy,” Shah says. “So you need to think – how would I fit this in this week? What would I have to give up to do it? We need to realise that slack in the future is an illusion.” It’s a practice he follows as well. Shah’s colleague Sendhil Mullainathan suggests thinking about our schedules as less like a pantry that we cram anything and everything into, and more like an art gallery where we intentionally decide what is most important and how to arrange it so that everything fits. He recommends setting alerts to help us remember what’s important when we start to fall into the scarcity trap. “Once we’re short on time, we’re already in a bad situation,” Shah says. “But if we learn to manage the time beforehand, we can keep that from happening in the future.” Brigid Schulte is a journalist, author of Overwhelmed: Work, Love and Play when No One has the Time, and director of the Better Life Lab at New America  "
Volatility,Why service workers are quitting,2024-09-25,2021-10-13,Mark Johanson,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20211007-the-service-roles-that-lead-to-burnout,"Long days and low pay already hurt service-sector workers. But since the pandemic, angry customers and staff shortages have made things even harder. When two Category 5 hurricanes hit the US Virgin Island of Saint John in quick succession in 2017, it was the most devastating thing to happen to restaurant owner Karen Granitz in her 50 years in the service industry. But then the 65-year-old picked up the pieces, reopened her business and carried on. “I could see a light at the end of the tunnel,” she recalls.  Covid-19 has been another beast entirely. “There’s no end in sight and we’re not in control, which is very unnerving,” says Granitz. The unprecedented circumstances created by the pandemic ultimately forced her out of business. “I closed the restaurant this past February, not because of a desire to be secluded from Covid, not because we weren’t busy enough, not because I couldn’t get supplies and not because of the shocking misbehaviour of the minority of the masses of tourists we got,” she says. The problem: staff were so burnt out they stopped showing up to work.  “Rude customers were causing tension in house, wearing masks was exhausting and my people were scared, whether they admitted it or not,” she says. When staff didn’t show up for work, Granitz was left to pick up the slack. “I am too old to be carrying on working 16-hour days and doing the work, physically, of six people, so I said I would walk out at the top of my game before a stretcher had to carry me out.”  The World Health Organization recognised burnout as an “occupational phenomenon” in 2019. While it’s often discussed in reference to office workers, studies show service-sector workers are uniquely affected by burnout, thanks to a combination of factors including long workdays, odd hours and a lack of regular time off. In many nations, including the United States, they are often under-paid, under-resourced and undervalued, with no sick pay or holiday-pay provision.  Right now, service-industry burnout could be worse than ever, due to a volatile mix of added stressors brought on by the pandemic, including unruly customers and dire staff shortages. It’s possible these high levels of burnout could play an important role in helping companies better understand the phenomenon and make changes that could lead to better workplaces. Yet that will be of little comfort to those experiencing daily hardship in customer-facing roles.    'Roll-your-eyes horrible’ customers  Many service-industry workers can hardly remember the early days of the pandemic, when they were lauded for their labour as essential workers. These days, people are more likely to come across news of attacks on workers in restaurants, stores and airplanes – often as a result of their new role as enforcers of Covid-era health rules. Of course, one of the quintessential tasks of a customer-facing job is dealing with problems, making these workers uniquely positioned to have hostile interactions during the pandemic.  Granitz says the past few months on Saint John have been the most volatile she can remember, with tourists fighting to get on ferries, misbehaving on tours and putting restaurant staff on edge each shift. “You’d have 100 fabulous, amazing people and then five would show up that were unbelievably, roll-your-eyes horrible,” she says.  In a recent survey of UK retail workers, 91% of managers said they’d noticed an increase in mental-health issues among staff. Chief among the reasons: 88% of frontline retail respondents said they had experienced verbal abuse in 2020, and 60% reported being threatened by customers. Jennifer Moss, author of new book The Burnout Epidemic, says this is likely the result of 20 months of being in a state of crisis, where workers are stressed out and, when they interact with the public, are being met with high levels of stress in return. “We’re always sort of at the edge right now and we’re not taking moments of pause before we react,” the Ontario, Canada-based expert explains. “So, there is just a level of volatility that those in the service sector haven’t necessarily dealt with before.”  Moss says this increased friction can lead to heightened levels of cynicism and hopelessness among service-industry workers as well as a sense that things are out of control. As a result, they may become disengaged, anxious or experience a negative personality change – all symptoms of burnout that are often misconstrued as poor performance.  The cycle of burnout and staff shortages  Studies show burnout is a key driver of employee turnover. So, it’s perhaps no surprise that the service industry has been among the hardest-hit by the Great Resignation.  Hospitality workers in the US have left their jobs in droves since shutdowns began in early 2020. Job vacancies in the UK hospitality industry are at the highest levels since records began, with many leaving the workforce to study or re-train in a new field. A lack of service industry workers in Australia has led to bidding wars in which chefs offered up to AU$200,000 ($143,520; £106,911) salaries just to accept a gig. As a consequence of these worker shortages, many businesses in the US have attempted to raise wages to lure them back. Studies show they aren’t interested. According to a Joblist report, former hospitality workers are transitioning out of the industry in search of a different work setting (52%), higher pay (45%), better benefits (29%) and more schedule flexibility (19%). Meanwhile, half of former hospitality workers looking for other work say no pay increase or incentive would make them return to their old restaurant, bar or hotel job.  Kevin Oliver is the manager of a variety store in the US state of South Carolina, who has lived the consequences of severe staff shortages. The 54-year-old, who has worked in retail since he was 21, says he’s logged an average of 60 to 70 hours each week this past year. There was a period of nearly eight months during which the only way he could take a day off was to ask the other manager-level employee to work a 16-hour shift.  “With those kinds of occurrences becoming more and more common, it’s no wonder some of us have been burnt out,” he says. Instead of having work-life balance, “for the bulk of the pandemic it's been mostly work, pretty unbalanced”. Oliver is leaving his job this month to take on a new position with a non-profit that he says offers fewer hours and higher pay.  Industry exodus  Moss says the pandemic has made it easier for burnt-out workers like Oliver to make career changes. “We’ve all gone through 20 months of facing our own mortality,” she says. “We have questioned, intentionally, what we want to do with our lives, what we want to do with work. We’ve also learned high levels of emotional flexibility, which makes you much more open to change.” If companies in the service industry want to keep their employees, they may need to start playing a major role in combatting burnout. Among entry-level staff, Moss says the relationship has long been transactional. “There is an expectation that they are going to leave, and we need to stop thinking like that,” she explains. “That means changing the way that we support those employees.”  This could be allowing workers to share their gripes openly without fear of repercussions, ensuring all assigned workloads are sustainable, checking in with employees to gauge their wellbeing and making workers aware of clear steps for career advancement.  “We’re in a paradigm-shifting moment in our workforce right now,” adds Moss. “Those companies that did a good job of listening to people, caring about their mental health, providing them with the support they needed, developing trust, building two-way communication and feedback – those types of organisations are the ones that will see their employees stay.”  Moss hopes the current situation may serve as a wake-up call, heightening awareness of burnout and its effects not just in office cubicles and hospital wards but also behind café counters and store registers. And with more attention to the problem, perhaps all of us can begin to reflect on our own interactions with service industry workers and start the process of de-normalising the poor behaviour reported in recent months, too."
Volatility,Snapshot shows economic strategy progress,2024-09-25,2023-12-24,By Alex Blake,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-isle-of-man-67801940,"The Manx government's economic strategy has shown ""signs of growth"" in its first year, the chief minister has said. The 10-to-15-year plan was launched in November 2022 with a number of targets to grow the working population. Alfred Cannan said the report was an ""overarching snapshot"" of  ""early indicators of progress"".  He said despite the ""economic challenges"" the report had shown things were moving forward positively. However Mr Cannan said there was ""still work to do over the coming years to ensure long term security, vibrancy and sustainability"", and the ""full value"" of the strategy would be ""felt over the long-term"". Government hopes to grow the population to 100,000 by 2037 and create 5,000 new employment opportunities.  The report said jobs had risen by 3% since November 2022 with 1,500 new roles, and there was a ""general trend of population growth"" with an average 90 to 100 more people each quarter. The plan's next target is to reach 1,800 new jobs by 2026. The first year report outlined that government had received an estimated £40m ahead of what was budgeted in income tax receipts, however a final figure on that would be announced in February's budget. It also stated market volatility and ""some large expenditures"" had effected the government's ""externally invested reserves"", which had fallen from more than £2bn in 2021 to £1.7m in 2023. Next year's focus was redesigning the Department for Enterprise's support schemes, which were ""a key factor"" in attracting and growing businesses, the report stated. Treasury Minister Alex Allinson said the year had seen ""growing numbers of people employed, new housing developments going through planning approval, and increasing tax receipts"". While the island had tackled cost of living challenges throughout 2023, he said there were positive signs of economic strength. The report will be presented to Tynwald in January.

Volatility,When do millennials get to be rich?,2024-09-25,2018-12-06,Meredith Turits,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20181205-with-boomers-wealth-to-inherit-will-millennials-get-rich,"If boomers are the wealthiest generation ever, then millennials should be poised to become rich through inheritance. The principle is correct – but the reality is more complicated. With matters of money, millennials have an uphill climb. That is the story we hear: millennials digging out from record student loan debt – expected to soar above £1tn ($1.27tn) in the UK over the next 25 years alone – and scrambling to pay rent with globally rising living costs and lower wages. And the numbers corroborate the story. Generation-on-generation wealth is declining, and millennials are financially worse off than those before them. None of this is exactly surprising, however. We have known for years that the 2008 global financial crisis hit millennials hard, with many graduating directly into a troubled global economy – from which some countries are still struggling to rebound entirely. Slow wage growth, high living costs and a lack of retirement savings mean millennials will be playing catch-up well into retirement. That’s if they can afford to quit working at all. The World Economic Forum predicts that by 2050, when millennials in the world’s eight largest pension markets start to retire, the retirement savings gap will be $427tn. That’s more than six times the 2015 figure of $67tn. Driving this shortfall are things like longer life expectancy, the deceleration of a long-term growth environment and poor savings rates, coupled with low levels of financial literacy. This doesn’t paint a hopeful picture for the future – but maybe there is a scenario that is not so bleak. Could a windfall from the richest generation – baby boomers – reverse the fortunes for millennials? Shelter from the storm Unlike millennials, baby boomers are the wealthiest generation in history – and will remain that way until roughly 2030. According to a wealth transfer report by the Royal Bank of Canada, when this group passes on their assets to younger family members, analysts expect them to leave $4tn of wealth to millennials within the UK and North America alone. This ‘inheritance boom’ will position millennials who have baby boomers in their families to receive record sums of inheritance. Is the solution to millennials’ money woes, then, to wait for the wealthier baby boomer generation to die out and inherit their assets? It’s an argument made by Paul Donovan, UBS Wealth Management’s chief global economist, who earlier this year predicted that millennials will actually become history’s wealthiest generation. Speaking to Business Insider, he argued that wealth doesn’t evaporate from the economy. And, since baby boomers are a larger generation than millennials, wealth will consolidate as it is passed down through the generations. Simply: fewer people, the same amount of wealth distributed among them. All in the family It’s not that simple, says Moritz Schularick, professor of economics at the University of Bonn in Germany. He says that the intergenerational wealth transfer model in which millennials become the wealthiest generation on record is a “global top 1% model”. “It applies to people who have so much they can never spend their wealth,” he says. “Normal people – and standard economic models – assume that people save for old age and then use their savings [and] wealth to pay for things when they have no income. At the end of their lives there is some inheritance, but not that much.” Lowell R. Ricketts, lead analyst for the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis’s Center for Household Financial Stability, agrees. He says that only a minority of baby boomer families will pass on “significant wealth”. (June 2018 figures from the US Federal Reserve confirm this: between 1995 and 2016, only 2% of bequests equaled $1,000,000 or more – yet this money comprised upwards of 40% of wealth transferred.) Although some assets by nature do retain value or even appreciate, Ricketts says, we cannot assume that baby boomers will hold onto assets until bequest. “A home and the property it’s built on may need to be liquidated in retirement to maintain a standard of living. Therefore, even if those assets don’t disappear from the economy, they might not be retained and passed on.” Tried-and-true plan B Even if the transfer of assets occurred and it also significantly impacted millennial wealth, says Ricketts, timing is a crucial factor. In the St. Louis Fed’s Demographics of Wealth summary, researchers write that American wealth accumulation for households headed by someone born in the 1980s are 34% percent below expectations. “These families are approaching important financial milestones (homeownership, raising children, saving for retirement) with diminished wealth accumulation,” says Ricketts. “A windfall in the future won’t help these families meet their current financial obligations. In other words, the promise of a transfer in the future won’t help meet the down payment required for a mortgage.” If you are among the millennials crossing your fingers for surprise cash infusion, then Donovan’s model likely doesn’t apply to you. Waiting on a windfall can’t be your plan A – and, even then, you might be waiting too long. As elder generations continue to struggle with retirement savings and live longer on less, millennials looking to save for retirement might want to keep courting the tried-and-true option: socking away money with lower-volatility vehicles. The silver lining of higher interest rates in the economy is not nearly as thrilling as found wealth, sure. But aren’t millennials used to taking what they can get?"
Volatility,Why parenting is so scary now,2024-09-25,2021-12-16,Kate Morgan,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20211215-is-parenting-scarier-than-ever,"In an uncertain world, young people are grappling with the question: to have children or not? When 37-year-old Heather Marcoux was expecting her son several years ago, she and her husband assumed it’d be the first of multiple pregnancies. “We certainly thought we’d have more than one,” says Marcoux, who lives in Alberta, Canada. But today, the parents are very clear that their now-primary-school-aged son will never have a sibling. “We can offer our one child a pretty good standard of living,” she says. “But if we added any more kids, it would go down significantly.”  It’s in part a financial decision; even with Marcoux and her husband’s incomes combined, childcare is a struggle, and saving in any significant way is impossible. But it also has to do with a lack of support and doubt about the future. “I feel like another child would be a burden we just could not handle,” says Marcoux. “Nobody wants to think of their growing family as a burden. That’s messed up to even say. But some days we just think it feels so impossible what we’re trying to do with one. How could we make [our day-to-day lives] work with more? Some family members are disappointed by our choice, but the world is just different now.”  The global birth rate is falling. That’s not necessarily news; it’s been on the decline since 1950, according to data collected by Washington, DC-based non-profit Population Reference Bureau. But the decline in more recent years has been especially stark: in 2021, the global fertility rate is 2.3 births per woman; in 1990, it was 3.2. A new Pew Research Center survey found that a growing percentage of childless US adults ages 18 to 49 intend to remain that way. In every single European nation, fertility in 2021 was below the 2.1 births per woman generally considered the “rate of replacement” for a population. In a number of those countries, birth rates hit record lows. It’s not hard to imagine why young people are hesitating to have large families. Financial stability is more difficult to achieve than ever. One in 10 non-retired Americans say their finances may never recover from the pandemic, and significant inflation could be looming in Europe. In many places, home ownership is all but a pipe dream. Political and civil unrest is rampant across the world, and climate is in crisis. It’s easy to adopt a dismal view of the future. “The central explanation is the rise of uncertainty,” Daniele Vignoli, professor of demography at the University of Florence, said in his keynote address at a research workshop hosted on Zoom by the European University Institute. “The increasing speed, dynamics and volatility” of change on numerous fronts, he explains, “make it increasingly difficult for individuals to predict their future”. And while the global unemployment rate rebounded post-recession, it hasn’t rebounded evenly across industries and levels. “There’s been a decline of good jobs for people in lower and middle-income households – union jobs, construction, manufacturing – those jobs were not coming back, and they’re stable, good jobs for people with lower levels of education,” says Gemmill. A 2019 US study showed the loss of certain jobs, including manufacturing, had a greater impact than overall unemployment on total fertility rate. Gemmill adds the rise of gig work and shift work – jobs that don’t generally come with family benefits, like childcare or healthcare in privatised countries – also creates questions around future stability, and influences decision-making around parenting. And economic uncertainty extends past employment, to housing uncertainty. A recent study by researchers at the Centre for Population Change at the University of Southampton, UK, showed the usual assumption that people would own a home before having children – one that was backed up by data until about 2012 – no longer holds true. In fact, financial realities may now mean young people have to choose between owning a home or having one or more children. “This disconnection between owning a home and becoming a parent has significant implications for parenthood in general,” said lead researcher Professor Ann Berrington in a press release. “If it is the case, as we propose, that homeownership is increasingly competing with the costs of having children, then it is likely that those who do manage to buy a home might well postpone or even forego having children.”  Marcoux says the pressures of paying a mortgage and maintaining a home are part of the reason she won’t have more children. It’s scary, she says, to think that something catastrophic could happen and throw the family into financial crisis. On top of that, adds Marcoux, she worries that she isn’t providing enough for her son. ‘Community has really eroded’ For would-be parents, these financial concerns can be compounded by worries over political and civil unrest, both local and global – fears that can be further exacerbated by the constant presence of media in our lives, which can amplify conflict and division. And while wars and political issues have been a reality for nearly every generation, everywhere, parents today arguably face a world that seems much scarier than that of their own parents or grandparents. Despite higher-than-ever life expectancy, improved technology and access to modern healthcare, omnipresent media means we’re more hyper-aware of all the world’s terrifying goings-on, from food shortages to school shootings. Data from the most recent Global Peace Index, an annual report compiled by the Sydney-based Institute for Economics & Peace, shows civil unrest has more than doubled in the world over the past decade, with a significant spike in 2020 alone, when it increased globally by 10%. Forty years of data across nations that experienced civil conflict shows fertility rates typically fall by up to one-third during periods of instability. People have fewer children, says Gemmill, when they’re terrified by what their progeny might have to contend with. Marcoux also feels divisiveness impacts people at the neighbourhood level, too. There’s a lack of community, she says, that makes parenting a lot harder – and lonelier – than it used to be. “When I was a kid in the early 1990s, all the moms on the block were stay-at-home-moms. Everybody was always around, you knew your neighbours and you had community support,” she says.   Family Tree This story is part of BBC's Family Tree series, which examines the issues and opportunities parents, children and families face today – and how they'll shape the world tomorrow. Find more on BBC Future. Marcoux says she doesn’t feel that support, and being isolated in her own community adds to the fears of modern parenting. In one 2018 study, two-thirds of US millennials surveyed reported feeling disconnected from their communities – unfortunate findings, considering social ties are one of the strongest predictors of happiness. “We don’t even know our neighbours. I think community has really eroded,” says Marcoux. “And now, especially, the political issues are really coming to the fore and some people are losing relationships with people we might’ve counted on in the past, because our beliefs, morals and ethics are just not compatible.” A climate of uncertainty In the Pew Research survey, when people who said they were unlikely to have children in the future were asked why, 5% cited environmental reasons. A 2019 poll by Business Insider showed close to a third of Americans, including nearly 40% of those aged 18 to 29, thought couples should “consider the negative effects of climate change when deciding whether or not to have children”. It's not just that a growing population increases humanity’s carbon footprint. Marcoux says she fears the next generation will suffer with the worst effects of climate change, and she worries about the version of the Earth her child and potential grandchildren will inherit.  She says the climate crisis only reinforces her choice to keep her son an only child. “Why would I bring another child into the mix when I sometimes think about the future and am just terrified for him? I do lay awake at night thinking about what his future will be like,” she says. “This is another thing my husband and I talk about nonstop. He wonders, did we make the right choice? Are we burdening our child with having to deal with the consequences? Were we being selfish?” They’re questions plaguing entire generations as they decide how many children to have, or whether to have any at all, in the face of increasingly desperate reports about the state of the planet. “It didn't occur to me that the climate’s tipping point might present itself during my own ovarian prime time,” writes Sierra adventure editor Katie O’Reilly in a 2019 piece for the magazine about grappling with the choice to pursue motherhood as an environmental journalist in the era of climate crisis. “It's become impossible to ignore the fact that things are looking increasingly grim for my generation's offspring. How could I look my hypothetical child in the eye and acknowledge that I willingly brought them into a chaotic, increasingly uninhabitable world, that I knew all their favourite picture-book animals were going extinct?” An uncertain optimism  As I write this, my own first child squirms and hiccups inside me. I’ve had a blessedly uncomplicated pregnancy, physically speaking, but mentally and emotionally, I’m knee-deep in murky, mixed-up feelings about impending parenthood. I thought that, at 31, I’d be in a different place financially. My student loans aren’t paid off, and, barring major legislative action, I’ll likely keep carrying them around until my kid is in kindergarten, at least. I live in rural Pennsylvania, US, where the cost of living is low and I have easy access to healthy, affordable local food. But my home is rented, I’m far from my family, and while I have a loving community of neighbours, it’s tough to shake the feeling of impermanence. I am anxious about birthing a child into a pandemic, and into a country where the political peace feels – to me – tenuous. I am anxious about so many things. Overpowering the fear is a deep, visceral excitement and an unmistakable optimism. I can’t wait to walk with my child in the natural world, battered though it may be, pointing out the preciousness of the Appalachian hardwood trees and the moths and mussels, and the deep snow on the ski hill.  I tell myself we’ll simply do our best to familiarise – not scare – our baby with the world’s problems, and then empower them to believe they can help right the ship. Parenthood is terrifying, but feels like exactly the right choice for me. Somehow, it seems, both things can be true."
Volatility,The battle over an accent mark,2024-09-25,2016-02-16,Agnès Poirier,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20160215-the-circumflex-a-battle-over-an-accent-mark,"A controversy brewing in France over a decision to eliminate the circumflex highlights fears about ‘English taking over’. Agnes Poirier takes a closer look. It took France completely by surprise. On 4 February the French learned that a spelling reform  – approved in 1990 but never implemented – would be taught in schools starting in September and will be featured in all new school manuals. The French are notoriously touchy, or sentimental, about their language but on realising that the circumflex accent was at risk of disappearing from 2000 French words (ie 3% of the French lexicon), they reacted with anger. Social networks were suddenly inundated with the hashtag #Circonflexe and #JeSuisCirconflexe, in a nod to #JeSuisCharlie, which became a rallying cry of defiance after the 2015 terrorist attacks against the satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo. What the French quite literally meant was that they took this spelling reform as an attack on their language, which they deem as serious as an attack on their freedom of speech. Used by the state as a unifying tool, the French language was instrumental in the birth of the modern French nation. It is a powerful ingredient of the French identity and one the French people have always felt passionate about. What is the circumflex accent? Indicated by the sign ^, it is placed over a vowel to show that the vowel or syllable containing it must be pronounced in a certain way. In French, the vowel so marked has a certain grave and long sound quality. The circumflex accent adds a certain musicality to a word; some would argue it confers poetry to words. More practically, it can also change the meaning of a word. ‘Mûr’ means ‘mature’, while ‘mur’ means ‘wall’; ‘jeûne’ means fasting while ‘jeune’ means young.The spelling reform put forward in 1990 by the Conseil supérieur de la langue française (High Council of the French Language), and vetted by the Académie Française, never actually aimed to kill the circumflex or to become compulsory. It originally proposed to “fix some anomalies” and to somehow standardise and simplify certain quirks of the French language. For instance, it suggested to remove the circumflex from above the letters ‘i’ and ‘u’ where the accent does not change the pronunciation nor the meaning of the word, as in ‘paraître’ (to appear) or ‘coût’ (cost). It also recommended to regroup compound nouns and get rid of the hyphen as in ‘porte-monnaie’, thus becoming ‘portemonnaie’ (purse). ‘Compound nouns without a hyphen? Looks ugly and lazy’ was the universal reaction on social networks, as if it was an admission that textspeak is now the norm.Word warThe French felt a pang in the heart at the thought of the disappearing circumflex and hyphens but the last straw came when they heard the suggestion that the ‘i' in ‘oignon’ (onion) should be dropped. The controversial Education Minister Najat Vallaut-Belkacem, attacked and accused on social networks of wanting to dumb down the French language, fought back by replying that the reform didn’t come from the Ministry but the Académie Française itself.The Académie, in turn, snapped back that it had only approved certain aspects of the proposal issued by the High Council of the French Language, an independent body. It reminded the French public that it was always on the side of the language, against all spelling simplifications for the sake of it, and that the actual usage of a language couldn’t simply be passed by decrees and laws. In football, they would call this argument a draw.

In football, they would call this argument a draw. In fact, French dictionaries already carry both old and new spellings, and teachers have been advised to accept both old and new spelling as correct. So many ask, “Why change?” “It will only confuse teachers and pupils even more,” deplored the well-known French literary critic Bernard Pivot. “And further confusion will spring from the fact that pupils will be taught one thing at school and will read another in novels.” Who will they trust more: their manuals or Balzac? This very French controversy however travelled fast and far, and seemed to strike a chord with France’s neighbours. The German media, for instance, seemed fascinated by the French circumflex. Perhaps because it reminded them of their own botched spelling reform of 1996, the Rechtschreibreform, opposed by a majority of teachers, writers and newspapers such as the prestigious Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. The reform originally aimed to systematise the correspondence between sounds and letters and simplify hyphenated spellings. A battle ensued, international committees of German language experts were formed, campaigners even brought the matter to the courts and in 2004, a purged version of the reform was implemented and old and new spellings were both deemed acceptable. The passion and volatility around languages may also increasingly have to do with the creeping presence and use of English terms in European languages. Italians, for instance, have always been very liberal in their use of English words, and seemingly unconcerned by the slow impoverishment of their language. They now feel however, that they might have gone too far. Their Prime Minister, the 40-year-old Matteo Renzi, has an English word for every reform he proposes, and almost every financial topic he debates in Parliament: ‘Jobs Act’, the ‘Stepchild Adoption’, ‘Bail In’ and ‘Spending Review’ to name but a few. This is beginning to get on many Italians’ nerves. In February, Italy’s daily centre-left newspaper La Repubblica ran a double page with the headline “In altre parole” (in other words), suggesting that Anglicism should be nipped in the bud, and not be used by politicians and legislators in official texts, especially when Italian equivalents exist. This only encourages the wider public to use them too, and it becomes impossible to counter them. A campaign and petition with the hashtag #DilloInItaliano (Say it in Italian) gathered 70,000 signatures in just a few hours. There was one time though in the early 17th Century when the Italian language was considered the malevolent influence. If Cardinal Richelieu founded the Académie Française in 1635, it was primarily to fight back the rampant Italianisation of the French language.

Volatility,The world’s VIP shoppers,2024-09-25,2015-08-25,Virginie Mangin,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20150824-the-worlds-most-influential-shoppers,"When Ling Zhang, a 36-year-old engineer visited Europe for the first time she did not hesitate to make Paris her first stop. “All my friends told me it was a ‘must-stop.’ They told me it was romantic, beautiful, full of elegant people,” she said, adding she will definitely return in the next five years. France’s capital is China’s new favourite holiday destination. Between 600,000 and 800,000 Chinese tourists visited Paris in 2014, an increase of nearly 20% on the previous year. The Paris region tourist board is confident this trend will continue. While painful, even the recent shares nosedive and  devaluation of the Chinese currency looks unlikely to dent the Chinese passion for luxury shopping. So while economists agonise over deceleration of growth, retail analysts aren’t convinced it will have an immediate impact on the buying trend. BNP Paribas, group chief economist, William de Vijlder, draws a distinction between the super-wealthy, and other Chinese tourists in Paris. He said that although the latter will be more impacted by stock market declines in China, “at this level it won’t make a dent in their spending patterns.” de Vijlder added that once “people decide to travel they have already looked at the numbers, they don’t then pause in front of a luxury shop considering which purse to buy, or not to buy.” Paris has rolled out the red carpet for its shopaholic visitors. The city as a whole has stepped up the charm offensive with hotel discounts; shopping experiences; Mandarin-language mobile phone applications and luxury products catered to Asian tastes from skin whitening creams to limited edition handbags and Cognac, some specifically launched during Chinese New Year. To improve communication with Chinese tourists, the tourist board has recently published a booklet called Do you speak tourist for taxi drivers, hotels and restaurants with advice on how to be more welcoming. Born to shop What makes the Chinese traveller so worth accommodating in particular is their deep love of luxury shopping, from watches to leather goods and fashion. And it’s taken very seriously, planned like a strategic operation. “I recall the first time I went to Paris, our group spent more than eight hours in shopping malls, including Galleries Lafayette,” said Wang Wei, 37, who visited in 2006 with a tour group and has since returned four times. “Chinese tourists look online, compare prices, see what products have not come out in China yet. They know exactly what they want to buy”. The Comité Régional du Tourisme estimates that on average a Chinese tourist spends roughly 1100 euros per trip, more than any other nationality, the only other that comes close are the Russians, who spend around 1076 euros per person. “It’s compulsory for them to come back with gifts made in France. A Chanel bag bought in Paris is just not the same as if it was bought in Beijing,” said Francois Navarro, the managing director of Comité Régional du Tourism. Other incentives for Chinese travellers to spend more overseas, include lower sales tax, favourable exchange rates and the certainty that the product they’re buying is authentic. Visitors can reclaim value added tax (VAT) back after leaving European Union countries. And, as luxury products are heavily taxed in China (with levies such as a consumption tax between 5-20% and import tariffs that can reach an eye-watering180%) this means some luxury goods can be up to half-price in Europe. Spend-a-holics Chinese tourists currently account for a staggering 40% of all luxury sales in France, according to an HSBC report published in February, so many of Paris’ retailers will continue to do whatever it takes to draw them in. The “grands magasins” – the equivalent of Harrods in London or Bloomingdales in New York – as well as the shops on the Champs Elysées, plus the luxury boutiques and jewellers around Place Vendome are all using a number of subtle and not so subtle tactics to cater to Chinese shopping whims. They provide free wi-fi; Mandarin-speaking staff; VIP lounges and dedicated express shopping lanes. The space is reserved specifically for tourists and the lanes are decked with a selection of Chinese shoppers’ favourites. Often Chinese tourists are in Paris just a day and half which leaves little time to walk idly through the vast shopping malls. “All Chinese clients are personally welcomed by a hostess speaking Chinese. Shopping items are delivered to their hotel directly. We continuously adapt so that their shopping experience is tailored to their needs,” said Marie Bart, deputy director of relations with clients of the Bon Marché, a high-end department store in the seventh arrondissement of Paris. Their typical Chinese client is a high-net-worth individual who does not hesitate to splurge on niche French luxury brands such as Roger Vivier shoes or bags and accessories from Moyna, which are harder to find in China. Bon Marché has created a VIP de-tax bureau, where certain shoppers can have VAT reimbursed on-site in a dedicated lounge. The store even offers extended hours in the in-house restaurant which allows continuous service for jet-lagged shoppers who need to refuel. Similar perks are offered at Paris’ other big department stores such as Le Printemps or the Galleries Lafayette, (the latter is still considered the holy grail for the first-time visitor). According to consultant, 3E, Chinese tourists now represent more than 30% of the Galleries Lafayette’s total revenues. Galleries Lafayette declined to comment. High-speed shopping lanes? The months following Christmas and January sales used to be a slow time for Paris. Not anymore. During Chinese New Year, Galleries welcomes as many as 100 busloads of Chinese tourists a day. That’s potentially 4,000 tourists walking through their doors daily. Treated as VIPs, they’re ushered through their own private entrance and offered a personal assistant. The shop is thought to pay some commission to the agent that accompanies these tourists but it declined to comment. “These shops are going towards a model where shopping space is more and more segmented and efficient. There are the shopping tills for the first-time tourist which only has an allocated amount of time and a shopping list to go through, and the VIP lounge for the more wealthy consumer that does not want to mix with the crowd”, said Erwan Rambourg, head of consumer and retail equity research at HSBC and author of The Bling Dynasty. The way these mega-brands show off their new products has also changed over the past five years, driven largely by Chinese buyers. These clients can now see the same items in shop windows in Paris, Beijing and Shanghai. “Paris stores are selling very little to locals, and as travel restrictions [from China] ease, I believe this will only go one way,” Rambourg said. He is confident the recent market volatility will have little impact on the trend. “A weaker currency obviously will have an influence on the propensity to buy from Chinese tourists, but not much at the current levels."" Rambourg believes there will be a negligible impact given how much cheaper and how much more exciting Paris will still seem to the Chinese traveller. Some stores saw the Chinese takeover coming. A controversial redevelopment of closed department store, La Samaritaine, purchased by luxury holding LVMH (which owns Louis Vuitton), proposed several years ago was mired for years in a planning dispute but has finally been given the go-ahead. The business plans a major renovation project to create France’s first downtown, luxury, duty free store complex with Chinese tourists in mind, as well as a palatial hotel.  To comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Capital, please head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.    "
Volatility,Why batteries are the new power plants,2024-09-25,2020-12-18,Cheryl Katz,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20201217-renewable-power-the-worlds-largest-battery,"The advent of ""big battery"" technology addresses a key challenge for green energy – the intermittency of wind and solar. The twin smokestacks of the Moss Landing Power Plant tower over Monterey Bay. Visible for miles along this picturesque stretch of the north Californian coast, the 500-foot-tall (150m) pillars crown what was once California's largest electric power station – a behemoth natural gas-fired generator. Today, as California steadily moves to decarbonise its economy, those stacks are idle and the plant is largely mothballed. Instead, the site is about to begin a new life as the world's largest battery, storing excess energy when solar panels and wind farms are producing electricity and feeding it back into the grid when they're not. Inside a cavernous turbine building, a 300-megawatt lithium-ion battery is currently being readied for operation, with another 100-megawatt battery to come online in 2021. These aren't the only super-sized batteries that will soon be operating at the Moss Landing plant. An additional 182.5 megawatts produced by 256 Tesla megapack batteries are scheduled to begin feeding into California's electric grid in mid-2021, with plans to eventually add enough capacity at the site to power every home in nearby San Francisco for six hours, according to the Bay Area utility, Pacific Gas and Electric, which will own and operate the system. Elsewhere in California, a 250-megawatt storage project went online this year in San Diego, construction has begun on a 150-megawatt system near San Francisco, a 100-megawatt battery project is nearing completion in Long Beach, and a number of others are in various stages of development around the state. California is currently the global leader in the effort to balance the intermittency of renewable energy in electric grids with utility-scale batteries, but the rest of the world is rapidly following suit. Recently announced plans range from a 409-megawatt system in South Florida, to a 320-megawatt plant near London in the UK, to a 200-megawatt facility in Lithuania and a 112-megawatt unit in Chile. Driven by steeply falling prices and technological progress that allows batteries to store ever-larger amounts of energy, grid-scale systems are seeing record growth. Many of the gains are spillovers from the auto industry's race to build smaller, cheaper, and more powerful lithium-ion batteries for electric cars. In the US, state clean-energy mandates, along with tax incentives for storage systems that are paired with solar installations, are also playing an important role. The mass deployment of storage could overcome one of the biggest obstacles to renewable energy – its cycling between oversupply when the sun shines or the wind blows, and shortage when the Sun sets or the wind drops. By smoothing imbalances between supply and demand, proponents say, batteries can replace fossil fuel ""peaker"" plants that kick in for a few hours a day when energy demands soar. As such, widespread energy storage could be key to expanding the reach of renewables and speeding the transition to a carbon-free power grid. ""Energy storage is actually the true bridge to a clean-energy future,"" says Bernadette Del Chiaro, executive director of the California Solar and Storage Association. You might also like: How quickly that future arrives depends in large part on how rapidly costs continue to fall. Already the price tag for utility-scale battery storage in the US has plummeted, dropping nearly 70% between 2015 and 2018, according to the US Energy Information Administration. This sharp price drop has followed advances in lithium-ion battery chemistry to significantly improve performance. Battery capacity has expanded too, with facilities able to store and discharge energy over ever-longer periods of time. Market competition and rising battery production also play a major role; a projection by the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory sees mid-range costs for lithium-ion batteries falling an additional 45% between 2018 and 2030. ""We're almost entirely piggybacking on the growth of lithium-ion battery technology, which is driven mostly by electric vehicles and consumer electronics,"" says Ray Hohenstein, market applications director for Fluence, an energy storage technology provider with projects totalling nearly 1 gigawatt (1,000 megawatts) set to come online in California within a year. The money put into research for those applications is driving down costs across the board, says Hohenstein. ""It's just like what we saw with solar panels."" In California, falling battery prices, coupled with the state's aggressive push toward a carbon-free electrical grid by 2045, have led to a packed pipeline of storage projects. A 2013 bill set a target of 1.325 gigawatts of storage to be commissioned for the state's grid by 2020. With 1.5 gigawatts of projects now approved – including more than 500 megawatts installed so far – that goal has already been surpassed, according to the California Public Utilities Commission. When the gigantic Moss Landing project becomes fully operational in mid-2021, it will more than double the amount of energy storage in California. Several other states are also now embarking on major energy storage projects. Among them: New York's 316-megawatt Ravenswood project will be able to power more than 250,000 homes for up to eight hours, replacing two natural gas peaker plants in the New York City borough of Queens. And the 409-megawatt Manatee system planned for South Florida will be charged by an adjacent solar plant. The facility, which utility Florida Power and Light says will be the world's largest solar-powered battery system, replaces two aging natural-gas-fired units. As a whole, the US's utility-scale battery power is set to grow from 1.2 gigawatts in 2020 to nearly 7.5 gigawatts in 2025, according to Wood MacKenzie, a natural resources research and consulting firm. Kelly Speakes-Backman, chief executive of the US Energy Storage Association, says that battery storage additions doubled in 2020, and would likely have tripled had it not been for construction slowdowns caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. Europe has been slower to get on board with storage. ""In general, Europe is a bit more conservative"" when it comes to such developments, says Daniele Gatti, analyst for IDTechEx, a UK-based market research firm specialising in emerging technology. Energy storage development in Europe has been hindered by a restrictive electricity market dominated by government auctions that tend to undervalue storage, she says. Still, some big-battery projects are now taking shape, including the 320-megawatt Gateway system to be built at a new port facility near London. Globally, Gatti projects rapid growth in energy storage, reaching 1.2 terawatts (1,200 gigawatts) in the next decade. Key players include Australia, which in 2017 became the first nation to install major battery storage on its grid with the 100-megawatt Hornsdale Power Reserve, and is now planning to add another 300 megawatts near Victoria. The new system will dispatch electricity between states on an as-needed basis, maximising the efficiency of existing transmission infrastructure and reducing the need for building new power lines that would sit idle most of the time. A similar projects are gearing up in Baden-Württemberg, south-west Germany. And while the US's Moss Landing is set to be the world's largest battery, it may be so for long. Saudi Arabia has just announced a bid for that title, with a massive solar-plus-storage system on the country's west coast. The facility will provide 100% renewable energy around the clock to a resort complex of 50 hotels and 1,300 homes being built along the Red Sea. With a recent report concluding that most fossil fuel power plants in the US will reach the end of their working life by 2035, experts say that the time for rapid growth in industrial-scale energy storage is at hand. Yiyi Zhou, a renewable power systems specialist at Bloomberg NEF, says that renewables combined with battery storage are already an economically viable alternative to building new gas peaker plants. Pairing electricity generation with storage works especially well with solar energy, which generally follows a predictable daily pattern. And, says Zhou, as more solar energy enters the grid, the cost of operating gas plants actually goes up. ""That's mainly because [gas plants] are forced to cycle on and off much more now because of solar penetration,"" Zhou says. ""This adds wear-and-tear, and shortens their lifetime."" Batteries are even beginning to reach a size – around 200 megawatts – that enables renewables to replace small- to medium-sized natural gas generators, says Fluence's Hohenstein. ""Now we're able to truly build these hybrid resources – solar, storage, wind – and do the job that was traditionally done by fossil fuel power plants,"" says Hohenstein, whose company is seeing a surge of interest in large projects. Adding storage also makes renewable energy more profitable, says Wesley Cole, an energy analyst with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. ""One of the challenges of renewable energy is the more you put on the grid, the more the value declines,"" Cole says. Storage helps deal with that by soaking up excess energy that would have been lost in the middle of the day, when electricity demand is lower, and moving it to a time when it is more valuable. While energy storage is thriving in high-value markets, such as California, battery prices still need to come down more to reach large-scale global deployment.

Volatility,Time to invest in the Eurozone?,2024-09-25,2013-08-16,Bryan Borzykowski,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20130815-time-to-invest-in-the-eurozone,"European policy makers, central bankers and the region’s citizens surely felt relief on Wednesday when Eurostat, the eurozone’s statistics agency, revealed that the 17-country European Union had finally come out of its year-and-half-long recession.  There’s another group of people who should thrilled to see the eurozone economy finally growing again: retirement savers.  Over the last two years European stock markets have lagged a number of other markets. Since May 2011, which was shortly before the recession and just prior European markets tanking, the US’s Standard & Poor’s 500 index is up 34%, while the Euro Stoxx 50, an index that tracks blue-chip eurozone companies, is down 5%. Individual country performance has been mixed — but still below the S&P — with Spain’s Ibex 35 falling about 14%, France’s CAC 40 up 8% and Germany’s DAX up 21%. But as the eurozone begins to grow again, retirement accounts around the globe could get a big boost. Public companies, and their stocks, are likely to see some gains as the economy improves, investment professionals said. Most diversified investment portfolios will have some exposure to Europe and because European stocks have been seen by some as cheap, it’s likely that exposure has increased since the eurozone recession began. That could be a boon for retirement savers who have added European stocks to their portfolios. Investors adding European stocks Two years ago Mouhammed Choukier, chief investment officer at London-based Kleinwort Benson, which manages US$7.4 billion, had no client money exposed to Europe. He began adding European stocks in the first quarter of 2012 and now his clients’ equity portfolios have about a 20% allocation to the region, excluding the United Kingdom. Choukier is confident that his clients will see their savings tick higher the healthier Europe becomes. “Without a doubt we think returns will increase,” he said. “We think that over the next couple of years European equities could push ahead and realize some value.” Norman Raschkowan, vice-president of investments for Toronto’s Mackenzie Investments, has also increased his allocation to European stocks. The region now accounts for about 20% of the non-Canadian equity portion of his funds, up from less than 10% two years ago. According to EPFR Global, a Cambridge, Massachusetts-based firm that tracks global mutual fund inflows and outflows, over the last six weeks $7.1 billion has flowed into European funds. That’s the best six-week run the region has had since April 2008. Investor confidence and an improving economy has a lot do with the change in fund flow direction, but if you have a diversified portfolio your allocation to Europe — both in personal portfolios and pension funds — has also been increasing because the region is cheap relative to other markets. On a price-to-book basis, Europe is trading at a 25% discount to its long-term average, said Choukier. Spain is trading at a 45% discount, while Germany is trading at a 15% discount. On a 2014 price-to-earnings basis — a key valuation that shows how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of a company’s earnings — the Stoxx 50 is trading at 10 times earnings, while the Dow Jones Industrial average is trading at 11.7 times earnings. Stephen Lingard, managing director of Franklin Templeton Multi-Asset Strategies, manages funds for Asian and European clients and he, too, has increased his allocation to Europe. He believes that as valuations climb closer to their historical norms — something he said should happen over the next 6-to-12 months — investors will get a good boost in returns. But Lingard cautions investors not to get too carried away. Just because Europe has had a couple of quarters of growth doesn’t mean the region is problem free. Lingard is still concerned about high unemployment and worries that improving markets could cause policy makers to take their eye off many issues that are still pressing. Still, Choukier believes that over the next seven years, Europe will give investors an annualized 8% total return per year, versus the 5% he projects for American markets.   Not too late For investors who have little or no exposure to the region, Choukier said it’s not too late to buy in. He recommends purchasing an exchange-traded fund that tracks the main European indexes. Raschkowan said that certain sectors, such as auto parts or pharmaceuticals, offer opportunities, too. If you want to own individual company stocks, Lingard said the best bet is to look for companies with a headquarters in Europe, but business and product sales around the world. These companies tend to be less susceptible to volatility because they operate in other jurisdictions. “The best time to own risky assets, like Europe, is when a country is coming out of a recession,” said Lingard. Take the US, for instance. Since the recession ended in June 2009, the S&P 500 is up 81%.   “When you get better economic data, you get big gains,” he said."
Volatility,"Scottish Water could hike prices further, boss says",2024-09-25,2024-02-05,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-68204002,"An 8.8% rise in water bills this April could be followed by future hikes in the coming years, Scottish Water's chief executive has warned. Alex Plant said the scale of the challenge facing the publicly-owned company meant further investment would be needed. However, he denied hikes have been agreed for 2025 and 2026, stressing that increases are decided on annually.  Rates had already risen by 5% in 2023 and by 4.2% in 2022.  Asked on the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme if Scots should be planning for rates increases in the coming years, Mr Plant pointed out that in 2021 the Water Industry Commission for Scotland, an independent regulator, had recommended above-inflation rises until 2027.  He said that changes to rates in 2022 and 2023 had been reduced due to the pandemic and associated cost of living pressures.  Asked whether people should be planning for price hikes, Mr Plant said: ""If you look at the scale of the challenge in front of us, yes that is the general sense - we're going to have to, as a nation, find ways in which we continue to invest at a greater rate than we have been thus far. ""So that is the kind of future we are facing.""  Water charges are collected along with council tax in Scotland meaning bills will rise in April despite the Scottish government's council tax freeze. The size of the water bills varies with council tax bands, but Scottish Water said the average household would see an increase of £35.95 a year, or about 70p per week. Mr Plant said Scottish Water's infrastructure, some of which was built in the Victorian era, was not designed to withstand ""volatility"" in the weather caused by climate change. He cited recent flooding, as well as droughts.  He said: ""This is all about putting the investment in place that can mean we can keep providing resilient services to customers across the country."" The chief executive said last year's 5% increase had been below inflation. He added: ""At some point you can't keep kicking the can down the road because otherwise services suffer and you'll be leaving future generations having to pick up the tab for the investment we should be making now.""  Mr Plant said decisions about rates were made annually and ""whatever circumstances may prevail at the time would be taken into account by the board"". "
Volatility,"Scottish prisons are full, 'we can't take any more'",2024-09-25,2024-02-05,By Lucy Adams,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-68152057,"The head of the Scottish Prison Service has said the jails are too full and she may soon have to say ""enough is enough, we cannot take any more"". Teresa Medhurst told BBC Disclosure prisons were reaching a ""tipping point"" and emergency powers could be needed to release inmates early. She said if numbers continued to rise, drastic measures could be needed as soon as next month. The prison boss said ""all options would need to be on the table"". There are currently about 8,000 people behind bars in Scotland but that is projected to rise to 8,700 this year. Ms Medhurst said that if the numbers went above 8,500 then the Scottish government would have to consider releasing hundreds of prisoners with no restrictions placed on them like it did during Covid. ""If I have to say enough is enough then it is because we are at a tipping point,"" she said. ""We cannot take any more. Prisons become very unsafe. The atmosphere, the tension, the volatility increases. Levels of violence increase, levels of self-harm increase.""  The prison chief said the prison service was looking to double the number of inmates released early on electronic tags to reduce numbers - and considering pre-fab housing blocks to increase capacity.  She also said Police Scotland was being asked to look at how it could divert more people away from court and efforts were being made to tackle the backlog in prisoners on remand. The number of people in prison awaiting trial in Scotland has increased to record levels and almost a quarter of inmates have not been convicted. This is one of the reasons the overall population is rising. David Gray is in HMP Perth on remand, awaiting trial, and said overcrowding and mental health problems were a bad combination. ""They just don't have the numbers or manpower to deal with the scale of the problem in here,"" he said.  ""Another part of it as well is toxic masculinity where men, especially the kind of men in here, don't want to talk about their problems.  ""It's a bad mix, services not being there if people do want to talk, and ones who just don't want to in general. Combined with drug use."" Ms Medhurst told Disclosure: ""At the moment I'm confident that we can manage between now and the spring time.""  But she said projections for March-April made her ""less comfortable"" that the service could cope. To see the impact of overcrowding we were allowed unprecedented access to film in HMP Perth for five days, Over the past 20 years I've been into many of Scotland's prisons as a journalist but the access is usually highly restricted.  For this programme, I was allowed into every part of the prison and much of the week was spent walking about the halls talking to prisoners - many of whom have not been convicted and are awaiting trial.  Residential manager and prison officer Craig Stewart was one of those who escorted me around the jail, Scotland's oldest, which still uses halls built by French prisoners during the Napoleonic Wars. The ratio of staff to prisoners on the halls is about one officer to 23 prisoners.  Officers and inmates tell us hyper-vigilance is a necessary part of everyday survival. During recreation time all the men are out of their cells.  While walking around C hall with Officer Stewart, there were 42 men, some getting showered or playing table tennis and pool.  Officer Stewart explains that this particular hall has every type of prisoner from petty thieves to serious organised criminals and murderers.  My camera operator, producers and all the other officers were behind a grill gate at the far end of the hall about 50m away as we walked around the hall.  The mood was calm but Officer Stewart says it can turn to violence with the ""flick of a switch"" and for just a moment, I got a sense of how frightening and volatile it can be. The most startling thing is the constant noise of the place and how every person seems less menacing and more human than you would ever imagine if you read what they had done in the past.  Many of them speak of remorse and wanting to make amends.  Chris Martin is one of those who says he wants to leave his mistakes behind him. He started doing heroin when he was 15 and has been in prison more than 30 times.  He has gone through recovery in HMP Perth and is getting out soon.  ""I'm getting a job. I want to start a family,"" he said. ""That is living to me. That is life."" ""I want to just be able to live a normal lifestyle."" Brian Kinloch is in HMP Perth remand awaiting trial. He was one of the 662 prisoners in Perth when we went in. The prison capacity is 630. He grew up in care and has seen the impact of self-harm and suicide during his time here. ""Since I've been in I've been trying to access mental health which has been very difficult. It'll be a seven-month waiting list,"" he told the BBC.  ""It's difficult for most people. There was a suicide just there. A young boy, 24-year-old. This is more like a mental health facility than a prison. Like I said, the boy down there didn't have seven months in him."" Perth & Kinross Health & Social Care Partnership said Brian was offered mental health input but disengaged with services.  It said the current waiting times for routine mental health appointments could be up to seven months. Urgent patients are seen within 24 hours. Prisons On The Brink is available here on BBC iplayer. Lucy Adams investigates the impact of overcrowding, drugs and suicides on inmates and staff, and asks whether our crumbling prison estate can cope much longer. Watch now on BBC iPlayer (UK Only) or watch on BBC One Scotland at 20:00 on Monday 5 February.  Prof Sarah Armstrong at the University of Glasgow published figures at the end of 2022 showing Scotland has a significantly higher rate of suicides and drug deaths in jail than England and Wales.  Last year she found there were 41 deaths in Scottish prisons.  ""I do feel like the state of the prison system right now at this moment is not safe,"" she said. ""Over the last three years there have been suicides in every single prison within Scotland, every single one. That's unusual. I mean, that is not something to be proud of."" Figures obtained by BBC Disclosure show self-harm in Scottish prisons is up by almost 40% in the past year - from 587 incidents to 818. Ms Medhurst said that was because of growing tensions as a result of overcrowding.  Inside Perth prison, we met Kieran Wallace in a cell that was built in the early 1800s which he shared with another inmate. Kieran is on remand, awaiting trial.  ""It would be hard enough for one person, never mind two,"" he said.  The European Committee for the Prevention of Torture says that cells shared by prisoners need to be above 8m² so they are not inhuman and degrading.  Kieran's cell is less than 7m² and he spends 19 hours a day locked inside it with another prisoner. Andy Hodge, the governor at Perth, said: ""The pressure of population is forcing us to put more people into one room. That's a real stretch. Two adult men into a room where you've got one TV, one kettle, tensions start to build, people start to fall out. ""Violence amongst the residents starts to go up."" He said there was contingency planning which could see the Scottish government beginning an early release scheme if the numbers get too high. Kate Wallace, the head of Victim Support Scotland, said inmates were reoffending when they leave prison because many of them were not managing to get onto rehabilitation programmes. BBC Disclosure has found there are 698 prisoners currently on a waiting list. ""Victims overwhelmingly tell us that the most important thing,"" she said.  She said rehabilitation was vital to prevent offenders creating more victims when they come out of prison. Justice Secretary Angela Constance said ministers were looking at contingency measures and investing in community sentences to try to reduce the prison population. She said: ""I would very much accept that as a consequence of a rising prison population, that that has an impact on progression, it has an impact on rehabilitation. And that is why addressing a rising prison population is also a matter of community safety."" Additional reporting by Katie McEvinney and Mona McAlinden. Prisons On The Brink will be on BBC One Scotland at 8pm on Monday 5 February and is available here on BBC iplayer."
Volatility,House prices see biggest drop in 14 years - Halifax,2024-09-25,2022-12-07,By Kevin Peachey,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63886983,"UK house prices saw their biggest drop in 14 years in November, falling 2.3%, reflecting ""volatility"" in the market, according to mortgage lender Halifax. November marks the third month in a row during which prices have fallen with potential buyers playing safe by delaying purchases. The average UK house price in November was £285,579. Higher mortgage rates, economic uncertainty, and the rising cost of living are all affecting the market. The annual rate of growth in property prices has now dropped from 8.2% to 4.7%. Kim Kinnaird, director of Halifax Mortgages, said: ""While a market slowdown was expected given the known economic headwinds - and following such extensive house price inflation over the last few years, this month's fall reflects the worst of the market volatility over recent months. ""Some potential home moves have been paused as homebuyers feel increased pressure on affordability and industry data continues to suggest that many buyers and sellers are taking stock while the market continues to stabilise."" However, she said that the falls should be put into context, given the rapid increase in property prices in the last few years. Property prices were up more than £12,000 compared with this time last year, and £46,403 higher than in March 2020 when the Covid pandemic began. The Halifax said Wales and the South West of England had recorded particularly sharp slowdowns in annual house price growth.  Both had been at the forefront of house price inflation during the pandemic, when the so-called race for space among buyers boosted demand for rural or coastal properties. The Halifax survey, based on the lender's own data, comes shortly after the rival Nationwide Building Society said prices fell 1.4% from October to November - the largest month-on-month fall since June 2020. Mortgage rates are much higher than at any time during the last decade, although earlier this week, the average rate on a new, fixed-rate two or five-year deal fell below 6% for the first time for two months. Tomer Aboody, director of property lender MT Finance, said: ""With another fall in property prices in November, buyers and sellers are clearly demonstrating more caution due to higher mortgage rates and the ever-rising cost of living.  ""As with any fall in pricing, buyer sentiment and confidence is key. But considering the macro-economic and seasonal factors affecting all consumers, along with the month-on-month increases seen over the past 18 months or so, the decline needs to be put into context as it is still minimal."""
Volatility,UK exports to Ireland show 'sharp improvement',2024-09-25,2021-06-11,By John Campbell,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-57443434,"Trade between the UK and Ireland showed a sharp improvement in April, official figures suggest. UK goods exports to Ireland were worth just over £2bn according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). That was up 11% from £1.8bn in March and up by 43% on April last year. The April 2020 performance will have been unusually low due to the pandemic, but the April 2021 figure was still higher than that month in 2019 or 2018. The ONS figures do not break down UK exports between those originating in Great Britain and those coming from Northern Ireland. Ireland's Central Statistics Office does provide that breakdown and its figures suggest that since the start of the year a steep fall in imports from GB is being partly compensated by a rise in imports from NI. NI is still in the EU's single market for goods meaning that, unlike GB, it still has frictionless trade with Ireland. UK imports from Ireland were worth £1.1bn in April, little changed either on a monthly or annual basis. The ONS figures suggest that Ireland-UK trade has not suffered the same volatility as trade flows in the other direction. That may be because the UK has not yet started implementing border controls on goods."
Volatility,Where does Rishi Sunak stand on the NI Protocol?,2024-09-25,2022-10-25,By Luke Sproule & Jessica Parker,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-63384244,"Boris Johnson promised to ""Get Brexit Done"" but his successor inherited a bogged-down dispute about special arrangements that were agreed for Northern Ireland.  Liz Truss lasted just 49 days in office, during which time talks with the EU restarted. Now Rishi Sunak has the keys to 10 Downing Street, he too will face the ongoing row over the Northern Ireland Protocol - part of the post-Brexit deal between the UK and EU. Mr Johnson's government introduced a bill in Parliament which could override parts of the protocol - and make it easier for some goods to flow from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. It was passed by the House of Commons and is currently being debated in the House of Lords. If passed, the bill would not only affect the UK's relationship with the EU, but also rules for businesses in Northern Ireland and the future of Northern Ireland's devolved government at Stormont. It collapsed in February after the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) walked out in protest against the protocol, pledging not to return unless its concerns were addressed. So where does Mr Sunak stand on the protocol? The Northern Ireland Protocol keeps Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods, preventing a hard border with the Republic of Ireland. But it means new checks and controls on commercial goods which come into Northern Ireland from other parts of the UK, creating a trade border in the Irish Sea. It is opposed by Northern Ireland's unionist parties, who say it undermines their place in the UK. Other parties - including Sinn Féin, Alliance and the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) - say the protocol is a necessary compromise to mitigate the effects of Brexit in Northern Ireland. The treaty was signed by Boris Johnson in January 2020, as part of the Withdrawal Agreement.  The EU has put forward its own proposals to ease checks, insisting a wholesale renegotiation is neither possible nor necessary.  For the first time since February, meaningful talks between Brussels and London got under way in early October. It's understood progress is being made in some areas, such as trade data, but both sides are deliberately keeping discussions low key. Mr Sunak has previously been critical of the protocol and garnered recent endorsements from high-profile Brexiteers in the Conservative Party. However it has also been suggested that he favours a more conciliatory approach than some more hard-line Eurosceptic Tory MPs. In May, Mr Sunak told Bloomberg the way the protocol was operating was posing enormous challenges to ""the stability of the situation"" in Northern Ireland. He said it had become a barrier to re-establishing power sharing at Stormont. Mr Sunak said the government's preference was a negotiated settlement and added that he wanted to ensure Northern Ireland's place in the United Kingdom was secure. At the end of 2021, the Daily Telegraph reported that Mr Sunak urged Boris Johnson and his former chief Brexit negotiator Lord Frost not to ""blow up"" talks with the EU about the protocol. The paper said Mr Sunak raised concerns over the potential impact this would have had on the economy and that he did not have the same sense of ""urgency"" as others in cabinet about dealing with the protocol. The Treasury, Mr Sunak's ministry at the time, declined to comment. He did not vote on the protocol bill at its second reading but he later voted in favour at its third reading. After initially backing a return for Boris Johnson, Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris, a strong supporter of Brexit, supported Mr Sunak's bid for prime minister, and on Tuesday he was reappointed as secretary of state. Mr Sunak also garnered the support of prominent Eurosceptic and former chairman of the European Research Group Steve Baker, a junior minister at the Northern Ireland Office before the reshuffle. Rishi Sunak only made his first visit to Northern Ireland in the summer, attending the Tory leadership hustings at a hotel outside Belfast. While he spoke briefly about wanting to renegotiate the protocol, there was zero detail during a half-hour Q&A and he has yet to be tested on virtually all policies relating to Northern Ireland. Despite a view in Brussels that Rishi Sunak is more ""pragmatic"" than his two predecessors, there's not exactly a rush of joy at his arrival.  For one thing, diplomats are waiting to see whether this government can actually manage to stay in power, given the recent volatility.  If it can, officials aren't sure what they'll get from Mr Sunak, who backed Leave in the 2016 referendum. There's a belief he won't want the protocol dispute to escalate into a trade war, given his emphasis on economic stability. But there's also a fear he may still pursue a hard-line approach because of pressure from Eurosceptic Tory MPs.  Talks on how to fix issues with the protocol have been quietly bubbling along in recent weeks. And while the UK's tone did markedly soften, if you look at their purest demands it still appears impossible the EU would agree to them.  All the while, the controversial Northern Ireland Protocol Bill continues its passage through parliament.  It's part of Britain's twin-track approach; trying to re-write the treaty through talks with a back-up plan of unilaterally changing the rules if those talks don't work out (although some critics see the bill more as a crass, albeit high stakes, negotiating tactic).  But the faster that bill moves through parliament, the faster we head towards this row hotting up again.  If the legislation however gets conveniently stuck, discussions between the two sides could drag on accordingly.  The other alternative is a breakthrough in negotiations but that will, in the end, require some serious compromises, not to mention real focus from Mr Sunak who - if you go by his words on Downing Street - doesn't seem to have put this issue at the top of his in-tray.  Brussels views the protocol bill as a clear breach of international law and has urged the UK to ""step back"" from its approach.  Senior EU figures have warned that Britain risks damaging trust as well as its reputation abroad. The European Commission has launched legal action over Britain's alleged failure to implement parts of the treaty. If the bill becomes law and ministers do start changing parts of the treaty, the EU has suggested it could also impose trade sanctions.  This is why you might have heard warnings of a possible ""trade war"".  UK access to the EU's Horizon research programme has also been described as collateral damage in the dispute. There is currently a block on the UK re-joining the £81.2bn funding scheme. "
Volatility,McIlroy questions FedEx Cup format,2024-09-25,2019-08-22,BBC Sport,https://www.bbc.com/sport/golf/49431617,"Rory McIlroy is fifth in the FedEx Cup standings and will start the Tour Championship on five-under par Rory McIlroy says he is unsure about the new format at the season-ending Tour Championship and has questioned the $15m prize on offer for the winner. Only the top 30 on the PGA Tour's FedEx Cup points list qualified to play in Atlanta, with players' starting scores then staggered by their position. It means Justin Thomas, who won the BMW Championship on Sunday, begins at 10 under par with a two-stroke advantage. Northern Ireland's McIlroy, fifth in the standings, starts at five under. ""You can shoot the best score of the week and not win the golf tournament,"" McIlroy said. ""If that happens to someone it's going to be hard for them to wrap their head around."" Patrick Cantlay is second in the standings and will start at eight under par on Thursday at East Lake Golf Club, with fellow American and world number one Brooks Koepka at seven under. Starting scores then work on a sliding scale down to the players in 26th to 30th, who begin on level par.  ""There isn't a person on the planet that's experienced this before, for the stakes it's for,"" said American leader Thomas. ""I'm just going to try to deal with it the best I can."" The ""Starting Strokes"" format has been introduced with the intention of eliminating the confusion of past FedEx play-offs, when the winner of the final tournament was often different from the series champion. World number three McIlroy, 30, says he has spoken to sponsors about how the FedEx Cup's ""legacy"" compares to golf's four majors. Referring to the PGA Tour's intention for the tournament to have a legacy as the final element of the 'season of championships', the run of tournaments that takes in the Players Championship, four majors and then FedEx Cup, McIlroy queried whether having players start on different scores was ""the best way to do it"". ""I get it from a fan experience point of view,"" he said. ""I get it from giving guys that have played better throughout the year an advantage, but I don't know... come back to me on Monday and I'll tell you if it has worked or not."" The Tour Championship winner will take home $15m (£12.3m), increased from $10m last year, but McIlroy says ""it doesn't need to be about the money, it should be about the prestige of winning an event that you'll be remembered for"". ""Who knows what the winner wins at the Masters? I don't know because that's not what it's about,"" he said. ""The money's great but I'll get more satisfaction from winning the golf tournament and playing well. I don't think the money needs to be front and centre because I don't think that's what the fans care about. ""It's definitely a thought that came into my head, 'how can we make ourselves more relatable to the fans?', and having $15m front and centre isn't probably the best way to do it."" Masters champion Tiger Woods and Open winner Shane Lowry both failed to qualify for the top 30 over the course of the season. ""I want to emphasise the fact that what Tiger and Shane did this year, those are two of the greatest stories of the year. So would you want them here? 1,000%,"" said PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan. ""But you look at every other sport and their play-off format, and you'll have top teams that fall out early. You'll have some things that you may not have predicted, particularly at the moment when they won those two big events. ""You've got to play exceedingly well over the course of an entire season, and, with volatility, there's risk."" PGA Tour European Tour LPGA Tour Ladies European Tour"
Volatility,McIlroy happy to escape major 'hype',2024-09-25,2015-06-16,BBC Sport,https://www.bbc.com/sport/golf/33158833,"This video can not be played McIlroy refreshed for US Open challenge US Open Venue: Chambers Bay, Washington Dates: 18-21 June Coverage: Live commentary on BBC Radio 5 live from 22:00 BST on Saturday and Sunday and live text updates of all four days from 19:00 on the BBC Sport website. Rory McIlroy believes he is in a better frame of mind heading into the second major of the season at the US Open.  The 26-year-old world number one says he could not escape the ""hype"" at the Masters in April as he attempted to complete a career Grand Slam. ""It has been nice not to have all the attention on me. I felt that is what it was at Augusta and I couldn't get away from it,"" McIlroy told BBC Sport. He finished a best-ever fourth behind winner Jordan Spieth at the Masters. McIlroy, whose first major win was the US Open in 2011, is hungry to repeat that triumph after a two-week break from the game. ""I will be disappointed if I do not win a major this year,"" added the Northern Irishman. ""My seasons now are based on major wins. ""I have won three times this year which is great, and lead the world rankings."" Rory McIlroy missed the cut at the Royal County Down Golf Club - a tournament he was hosting McIlroy followed up a victory at the Wells Fargo Championship in North Carolina with back-to-back missed cuts at the PGA Championship at Wentworth and the Irish Open in May. ""Volatility in golf is actually a good thing,"" said McIlroy, who starts as favourite at Chambers Bay, with 21-year-old American Spieth second. ""If your good weeks are really good, it far outweighs the bad weeks. ""I feel a lot better coming into this tournament than I did going into the last two. The two weeks off helped to refresh the mind a little bit. I had not played five weeks in a row for a long time.  ""This is hugely important, a chance to win a second US Open and my fifth major. There was just so much hype and so much attention around Augusta."" Two-time Open champion Greg Norman on attributes of Rory McIlroy ""His attitude as a person allows him to play the way he does. He'll make a mistake and he'll laugh about it, stand up to it, apologise for it. ""Rory believes in himself. He came back from two very interesting situations in his private life, with his fiancee and the lawsuit, and he managed those extremely well for a young kid. His personality is perfect for what the game of golf needs, and that's why golf is in a fantastic state."" McIlroy said he liked the links-style course at Chambers Bay and that there would be opportunities for players to post under-par rounds.

Volatility,EU clubs together on energy and invites UK,2024-09-25,2022-09-08,By Katya Adler,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-62822368,"""Gasmageddon"" is bearing down on Europe this winter.  It may sound like the stuff of nightmares. But this is no science fiction. The number of households facing energy poverty has doubled across the EU, according to financial services provider Allianz.  Gas shortages could drive up retail prices by 200%. Three-quarters of companies in the bloc's economic powerhouse, Germany, say they're experiencing ""severe strain"" from spiralling energy prices. In the UK, energy bills have gone up 80%. The word ""recession"" is whispered everywhere.  Vladimir Putin is not only using conventional military weapons in Ukraine, he is also weaponising energy to try to intimidate the West, as he seeks to readjust the balance of power in Europe to Russia's favour.  On Wednesday, he railed: ""We will not supply anything at all if it is contrary to our interests. No gas, no oil, no coal, no fuel oil, nothing."" Squeezing the EU had looked to the Kremlin like a piece of cake. The bloc relied on Russia for 40% of its gas and a third of its oil before Mr Putin invaded Ukraine. Big EU powers Germany and Italy were even more dependent. The Russian president has been switching gas supplies on and off at whim for months and the colder months are fast approaching. Even countries traditionally less reliant on Russian energy, such as France, Spain and non-EU UK, are affected by the volatility and price hikes on the global energy markets.  With businesses threatened with bankruptcy and vulnerable voters facing a choice of paying for food or fuel this winter, political and social tensions have soared alongside prices. Prague saw mass demonstrations last weekend, with angry crowds protesting against the cost of living crisis and demanding an end to sanctions against Russia.  Bear in mind that the Czech Republic has, till now, always been hawkish towards Russia and outspoken about the need to defend Ukraine. But the economic pain at home is biting hard. As they did at the start of the Covid crisis, EU countries tried to find their own, national, solutions.  Spain slapped limits on air conditioning in public buildings and Germany tried to discourage people from using their cars by reducing fares on public transport, while in Italy, a Nobel prize-winning physicist sparked a furious cultural debate, suggesting people could cook pasta with the heat off to save energy and cost.  A number of member states have hastily assembled financial packages to help struggling households and/or businesses. Their aim: both to reduce energy consumption and to keep costs down for consumers.  German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has become fond of peppering his (German-language) news conference with the English words of the song You'll Never Walk Alone, popularised by Gerry and the Pacemakers.   But the focus now is on finding a European solution. And not a few EU figures, French President Emmanuel Macron included, have said they'd love the UK to be part of a plan. More on that later. The drive for the common EU approach is manifold. In part, it comes from the same post-Covid crisis realisation that as part of a single market, when the economies of some member states suffer, it pulls everyone down.  There's also an appreciation that there's strength in numbers. Countries such as Italy and Germany have been busy trying to find alternative energy suppliers - in Algeria and the UAE, for example. But if the EU as a whole, with its economic clout, makes the energy deal, the conditions are likely to be more favourable.  ""We have to achieve that we only pay the world market price, rather than a higher price,"" said Mr Scholz on Wednesday. His Belgian counterpart, Alexander De Croo, pointed out that gas prices in Europe are currently double those in Asia and 10 times as much as in the US. EU purchasing power would also avoid one member state trying to outbid another in their scramble for energy. Not a good look when it comes to EU unity. There is, too, a very sincere desire in the EU to stop pouring energy money into Russia's war chest. It's true, the majority of member states have drastically reduced their reliance on Russia by now. But as one very irritated EU diplomat pointed out to me, sky-high energy prices mean EU countries still pay almost the same daily amount of money to Moscow, although they currently receive so much less. ""Putin has to be roaring with laughter at us,"" he said.  EU energy ministers have been summoned to an emergency meeting in Brussels on Friday to discuss a raft of proposals to jointly combat the crisis.  ""Russia is manipulating our energy markets,"" tweeted EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen, ""[but] we have the economic strength, the political will and unity to keep the upper hand.""  EU countries have already reached agreements on reducing Russian oil imports and Russian gas reliance. The Commission established joint gas purchasing capabilities back in April and planned sufficient energy storage ahead of this winter.  Proposals for this Friday include: But EU leaders are far from united in their priorities or energy planning. Unanimous or immediate agreement is unlikely on Friday. Germany is still iffy about capping Russian gas prices, for example. Poland wants all extra-EU gas sources to have a price cap.  And there are other tricky issues such as if/when to decouple the gas and electricity markets (a similar debate rages in the UK) and how to ensure consumers understand the long-term need to change habits and consume less energy, even if governments intervene to keep prices lower. European Green parties are also extremely uneasy about the EU rush to replace Russian fossil fuel supplies with others elsewhere. The German Green Party is a senior government coalition partner. Its co-chair, Robert Habeck, is deputy prime minister and economics minister.  He's been travelling cap in hand to the United Arab Emirates, keen as keen for fossil fuel deals - an irony not lost on his opponents. German Green MEP Ska Keller admitted to me that yes, Green politicians had big plans, ""but then governing happens."" She insisted that polls in Germany indicate voters understand that the Greens are being ""responsible and pragmatic"" in a time of energy crisis, but that they haven't forgotten the climate emergency. European Commission energy spokesman, Tim McPhie, is quick to underline when that it comes to energy, there are ""short-term fixes and longer term fixes"". The EU Green Deal and climate goals are a huge source of pride in Brussels.  Mr McPhie says long-term European security is not about replacing Russian gas with gas from somewhere else - it's about renewables' energy efficiency.  And what about that invitation for UK co-operation on energy that I mentioned earlier, repeated to me again this week by the French Europe Minister, Laurence Boone? Her predecessor, Nathalie Loiseau, says that in these times of crisis, co-operation makes more sense than post-Brexit ""splendid isolation"". But while it could make economic sense for the UK to join together with the EU to try to benefit from lower prices on the global market, new PM Liz Truss, even if tempted, might find that co-operation politically awkward with some parts of her Conservative party. There is, though, an aspect of energy and the EU that Prime Minister Truss won't be able to ignore. And that's to do with Northern Ireland. The island of Ireland has a single electricity market, interconnected to Great Britain, says Mary Starks, former director at GB energy regulator Ofgem, now energy specialist at Flint. But the Republic of Ireland is an EU member state, theoretically subject to EU common energy regulations. ""So what this means for both Northern Ireland and the Republic will come into focus at some point,"" says Ms Starks. And if wholesale energy prices are successfully reduced on one side of the Channel, but not the other? Ms Starks told me that normally, energy flows very freely across electricity and gas interconnectors, but if the EU, for example, managed to lower prices before the UK, then Brussels would ""need to take steps to ensure its cheaper power and gas did not 'leak' to the UK"". While Ms Starks says it would be highly unlikely that the EU would shut the interconnectors unilaterally, there would have to be some sort of regulation of trading and flows, in order to prevent leakage. And that would necessitate dialogue. "
Volatility,Emirates will fly to Russia unless owner stops it,2024-09-25,2022-04-18,By Sameer Hashmi,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-61140802,"Emirates' boss says the airline will keep flying to Russia unless its owner, the Dubai government, tells it not to. ""If we are told to stop we will stop, unless we are told otherwise, we will continue,"" Sir Tim Clarke told the BBC. Most major international airlines pulled out of Russia amid sweeping sanctions imposed by Western countries since the war began in Ukraine.  But Emirates is one of the few carriers that is still operating flights to Moscow and St Petersburg.  When asked if the airline would reconsider its position, Emirates president Sir Tim said that ""it was not his call"" but a decision that the United Arab Emirates (UAE) government would take.  As well as carrying passengers, the airline also transports cargo including humanitarian goods, food and medical supplies, which are not on the sanctions list.  Sir Tim added that it was important to recognise the Russian population may not be part of the war in Ukraine.  And that the diplomatic core of other countries, who have missions in Moscow need to be able to function by moving in and out of the country. He said: ""We are catering to people who are on the periphery of the main issue here, and that is probably the way the [UAE] government looks at it."" The United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia have rejected calls from western governments to impose sanctions on Russia.  Abu Dhabi has also not severed economic ties with Moscow. It was one of only three countries, along with China and India, to abstain in a United Nations Security Council vote in February to condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine. It also abstained in a General Assembly vote on 7 April to suspend Russia from the UN Human Rights Council. Since the outbreak of the war, Moscow has faced a barrage of unprecedented sanctions, including bans on Russian aircraft using airspace and airports in the US, the EU, the UK and Canada.  International flights by Russian airlines have been severely curtailed due to the sanctions. National carrier Aeroflot has suspended all international flights, except for its service to the Belarus capital Minsk, due to the sanctions.  Sir Tim believes that the war in Ukraine could spell long term implications for the global airline industry, especially if Russia is excluded by the West from the global economy. ""This [war] will have major manifestations of perhaps disadvantage for both sides. And this will have an impact on the industry,"" he said. Sir Tim said Emirates was seeing strong demand despite high oil prices. The airline has passed on the cost to consumers by adding a fuel surcharge to airfares but that hasn't impacted bookings.  ""Irrespective of that, people are ready to pay the prices that we have to charge to cover this enormous increase in the fuel price,"" Sir Tim said. He added that the airline industry was used to dealing with high oil prices but said he felt that budget carriers would find it difficult get through this without taking a financial hit. Brent, one of the main benchmarks for oil, has been trading above $100 for nearly two months since the Russia-Ukraine war triggered volatility in global energy markets.  The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has warned that the airline industry's overall financial performance in 2022 is likely to worsen due to the challenge of higher oil prices. Jet fuel makes up about a quarter of an airline's costs.  Despite the recent setbacks, Sir Tim said that Emirates had returned to profitability over the last six months due to ""roaring"" demand.  The carrier expects to report improved annual earnings this year after it posted a loss of $5.5bn in the 2020-2021 fiscal year as the Covid-19 pandemic ravaged the global aviation industry.  The Dubai government injected $3.1bn into Emirates to bail out the state-owned airline, which was forced to ground flights and lay-off thousands of employees after the outbreak of the pandemic. Sir Tim said the airline was now looking to hire 3,000 to 4,000 cabin crew and additional pilots on the back of booming travel demand. ""If we can have all our aircraft flying today, 270 of them then we would. I can't because I am just short of crew,"" he said."

Volatility,Why one of world’s poorest countries adopted Bitcoin,2024-09-25,2022-06-05,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-61565485,"The Central African Republic's decision to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender came as a surprise to many, but the government argues that it will secure an independent financial future for the country, as the BBC's Damian Zane and Guy Bandolo report. The president seemed to be following the Elon Musk style of cryptic cryptocurrency tweets. Under the teasing heading ""More to follow"" CAR President Faustin-Archange Touadéra typed ""Vires in Numeris"" - a Latin motto meaning ""strength in numbers"" that has been associated with Bitcoin. Then came his nation's motto. This was shared with the world a month after the CAR became only the second country, following El Salvador, to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender. The mineral-rich nation is ranked as one of the poorest in the world - a situation complicated by a near-decade-long civil war which has devastated much of the country. The government has recruited the Russian mercenary Wagner group to help in its fight against rebels. The CAR's Bitcoin announcement left many scratching their heads and some wondering if it had more to do with a political shift away from France and towards Russia. There has certainly not been a sudden explosion in the capital, Bangui, of businesses such as shops or cafes accepting Bitcoin as a means of payment. According to an estimate from 2020, nine out of 10 Central Africans do not have access to the internet - a prerequisite for using Bitcoin. That, along with a patchy and unreliable electricity supply, led some to question whether the CAR was the right country to test the theory that cryptocurrencies were set to replace traditional forms of money. The initial decision, announced on 27 April, was accompanied by little explanation except that it would open up ""new opportunities for our country"". The ""more to follow"" that President Touadéra was referring to in his May tweet was the announcement of a project called Sango - named after one of the country's official languages. This ""visionary"" plan would create ""a fantastic opportunity for anyone who believes in crypto investing"", according to a government press release. However, the website that the press release encouraged people to visit to find out more is opaque to say the least. To go on an investor waiting list, the visitor is encouraged to sign up to receive a ""secret code"". The code provides access to a flashy slide presentation that declares that the CAR wants to build the ""first legal Crypto Hub recognized by a country's parliament, that welcomes businesses and attracts global crypto-enthusiasts"". Sango is a ""Crypto Island… the first island in the metaverse that is backed by reality"".  The people behind the presentation used a lot of ""big words"" but ""the document was not very clear on exactly what they want to do"", says Stone Atwine, a crypto-specialist who runs digital financial services company Eversend. Among the jargon seems to be a plan to allow people to invest in mining and other industries using Bitcoin and a promise that no income or corporation tax will be charged. Mr Atwine believes that this could have potential as ""a lot of cryptocurrency enthusiasts are looking for great places to build where things are legal"". The CAR has significant deposits of diamonds and gold, as well as other minerals, and Bitcoin is being seen as an easier way to attract investors to the country. ""Impenetrable bureaucracy keeps us stuck in systems that don't give us the ability to perform. The solution was to rethink our economic philosophy,"" President Touadéra said in reference to the Sango project. The plan cannot be faulted for its ambition but when it comes to cryptocurrency and ordinary Central Africans, more publicity  - and infrastructure - are clearly needed. ""I don't understand what cryptocurrency is,"" Edith Yambogaze, who sells cassava in Bangui, told the BBC. ""I have a smartphone, but I do not have good enough internet to be able to use cryptocurrency. Also, I do not trust cryptocurrency because there are people who do scams on the internet."" This scepticism seems to be matched by some in El Salvador, where President Nayib Bukele promotes Bitcoin with a missionary zeal. ""El Salvador has had problems with the take-up of the Chivo Wallet,"" said Ganesh Viswanath-Natraj, an academic at Warwick University specialising in cryptocurrencies. The Chivo Wallet is a government-developed app to make Bitcoin transactions easier, but recent research suggested that while there were a lot of downloads when it was launched last year, there have been virtually none in 2022. Some people told researchers that they did not trust Bitcoin. Backers of CAR's adoption of the cryptocurrency, however, are asking people to be patient. MP Jean Galvanis Ngassiyombo, who is on the National Assembly's economic, planning and finance commission, admitted that the technological infrastructure was not yet in place in the country. But he told the BBC that a fibre optic network would be installed by the end of next year which could give everyone internet access. The CAR has signed a deal with neighbouring Cameroon to share its fibre optic network in 2023. ""What the [Bitcoin] law did is anticipate that technology so, in fact, we can be ready when that technology is available to us,"" Mr Ngassiyombo said. He is a cryptocurrency investor himself and told the BBC how he gets regular updates about price fluctuations on his phone. ""I made money today,"" he laughed as he showed how the app works. It is argued that in a country where few people have bank accounts, the adoption of Bitcoin will help encourage savings and offer a safe place to store and transfer money.  But many are sceptical. Dr Viswanath-Natraj argues that while there are advantages, investor concern about the country's financial stability could in fact drive up interest rates and the volatility in the Bitcoin price could damage savings. The Cameroon-based Bank of Central African States (BEAC) oversees the CAR's currency, the CFA franc, which is backed by France and is shared by five other countries in the region. It was not happy when the law was passed. A damning letter sent in April from the bank's governor, Abbas Mahamat Tolli, to CAR's Finance Minister Hervé Ndoba said the Bitcoin law indicated that the country wanted to establish a currency that could compete with or replace the CFA. He urged CAR to scrap the law, saying it could affect financial stability in the region. The International Monetary Fund was also critical, saying that it raised ""major legal, transparency and economic policy challenges"", the financial news agency Bloomberg reported. Supporters of Bitcoin, which is hailed as a disruptive force that improves the lives of ordinary people, may not be surprised by the attitude of established economic institutions.   But the criticism and where it is coming from also indicates that the CAR's move may have political motives as well as economic ones. While France's involvement with the CFA and the fact that it is pegged to the euro ensures its stability, critics also see it as a form of neo-colonial control. They argue that it stymies economic independence and allows France, the former colonial power, to retain its influence. The Jeune Afrique journal has reported that some government ministers have a strategy of trying to break away from France. Despite the fears of the BEAC, it is highly unlikely that the CAR would give up the CFA ""as this would cause major economic disruption"", analyst Nathan Hayes from the Economist Intelligence Unit told the BBC. ""It's a populist announcement from the government, rather than a serious shift in monetary policy,"" he said. It could also signal a move towards Russia. After President Touadéra came to office in 2016, the country started shifting its strategic alliance from France. As part of this, mercenaries from the Russian Wagner Group have been used to help fight rebel forces. There has been speculation that they are paid through the awarding of mining contracts but Bitcoin ""would be a way to circumvent any restrictions on payments if they wanted to move away from this in the future"", Mr Hayes said. But for the MP Mr Ngassiyombo, the move towards cryptocurrency has nothing to do with Russia. ""The way we conduct our business… depends on what the president of this country is trying to build for its own people."" And if the glossy Sango presentation is to be believed, he wants to create ""a digital future of endless possibilities""."
Volatility,Musk loses world's richest title as Tesla falters,2024-09-25,2021-02-23,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56174404,"Tesla boss Elon Musk has lost his title as the world's richest person after a recent slide in the electric carmaker's shares, the main driver of his wealth. Tesla shares have tumbled more than 20% since hitting a high of more than $880 in early January. They suffered especially steep falls this week, tied to the firm's recent risky $1.5bn (£1bn) investment in Bitcoin. The drop returned Amazon boss Jeff Bezos to the top spot on the rich list. The risk of being associated with the notoriously volatile Bitcoin - which has fallen sharply in recent days - may have prompted some Tesla investors to sell their shares, even if the firm has not been hurt by the declines, Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said. ""By Musk and Tesla aggressively embracing Bitcoin... investors are starting to tie Bitcoin and Tesla at the hip,"" he said.   ""The recent 48-hour sell-off in Bitcoin and added volatility has driven some investors to the exits on this name in the near-term.""  Bitcoin's value jumped nearly 50% in the weeks after Tesla revealed it had purchased $1.5bn of the currency and planned to accept it as payment.  But since climbing above $57,000 on Sunday, the cryptocurrency has dropped nearly 20%. It was trading at less than $48,000 on Tuesday - still higher than when Tesla disclosed its bet. Just as Mr Musk was credited with helping to fuel Bitcoin's rise, he may also have himself to blame for some of the recent Bitcoin declines.  In an exchange on Twitter over the weekend Mr Musk wrote that the price of Bitcoin did ""seem high lol"". Also driving the cryptocurrency lower were comments from US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who sounded a warning on Bitcoin on Monday. She called it an ""extremely inefficient way of conducting transactions"". The comments follow a recent surge of interest in Bitcoin, after major US firms such as Mastercard and Bank of NY Mellon followed Tesla's lead in announcing plans to incorporate the digital currency into their operations. Mr Musk's attention to Bitcoin comes as Tesla faces other challenges.  The firm recently halted most sales of the lowest-priced version of its Model Y SUV, with Mr Musk citing a desire to improve the car's range. Earlier this month, Chinese regulators summoned the firm over safety and quality issues, after reports of battery fires and abnormal acceleration. Rival carmakers such as General Motors and Volkswagen have also stepped up their focus on electric vehicles in recent months. The struggles follow an astonishing rise in Tesla shares in 2020, when prices leapt from less than $90 to more than $700. The increase propelled Mr Musk past Amazon boss Jeff Bezos in the world's richest rankings for the first time in January, while also raising questions about whether that value made sense for a firm that produces a fraction of the cars of its rivals.  The two billionaires have been vying for the top spot in the weeks since.  The more than 8% decline in Tesla's share price on Monday was the biggest since September and wiped more than $15bn off Mr Musk's net worth, according to Bloomberg. Shares fell a further 2% on Tuesday. Mr Musk's tweets have also famously triggered sharp moves in Tesla shares, including last year when the firm lost $14bn in market value after he wrote that its share price was too high."
Volatility,Can a rubberstamp parliament help China's economy?,2024-09-25,2024-03-04,By Stephen McDonell,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-68402147,"The Chinese government is under massive pressure to come up with solutions for its troubled economy. So people will be watching the National People's Congress to see what's on offer as it kicks off on Tuesday.  Nearly 3,000 NPC delegates are now gathering inside Beijing's cavernous Great Hall of the People to pass laws, approve personnel changes and delegate the operation of government to smaller groups which meet throughout the year. It is, for the most part, a week-long political performance which rubber-stamps decisions already made behind closed doors.  But given that the messages delivered have been thought through by those in power, analysts will be looking out for any change in the official Party line and what it might mean for China and the world. For example, a certain new phrase might signal a change in industrial policy or a potential new law governing investment rules. Crucially, the lens through which to view all of this is that there is nothing more important to the Communist Party than ensuring the longevity of its rule in China. For the current leader, Xi Jinping, it is absolutely paramount in virtually all aspects of life. This has not seemed like much of a struggle in recent decades, as business boomed and living standards improved for most, year after year. But now Asia's engine of growth is locked in a real estate crisis which has dissolved the life savings of many families who paid for flats which were never delivered; it has armies of university graduates who can't find good jobs and it is burdened by huge amounts of local government debt, which has robbed policymakers of the ability to inject funds into infrastructure in the same way they used to be able to, whenever times were tough.  It had been the case that a new road project, or a series of bridges, could soak up a lot of unemployment, unused steel and excess concrete capacity. But this is a period of much more uncertainty. ""This year's NPC will be held at a time of unusual ferment and volatility, particularly over economic policy,"" says Richard McGregor, author of The Party, which examines China's structures of government. He told the BBC that ""there is widespread unhappiness about the state of the economy, and in turn about the direction Xi Jinping has set for the country"". In the past, when enormous changes generated great concern - like the flooding of entire historic areas to make way for the Three Gorges Dam project - there have been protest votes registered at the NPC.  But it would take an exceptionally brave Party representative to try that under Xi Jinping. Mr McGregor said he doesn't expect denunciations of leadership during this Congress, as ""all of the delegates have learnt to stay very much on message"". However, he added that ""even critical murmurs will be significant"".  Professor Ann Lee from New York University said the session could see legislation providing more support to the private sector.  ""This is a tacit recognition that China's economy needs more entrepreneurial investment in order to meet Xi's high-quality growth goals,"" she said. A phrase Mr Xi has been using since the end of last year in reference to the direction of the country is ""new productive forces"". This is likely to be peppered through speeches in coming weeks as well. But what does it mean? Dr Jon Taylor from the University of Texas at San Antonio said that Mr Xi is referring to ""an emphasis on the development and commercialisation of technology and science, digitisation, and high-end manufacturing centring on emerging intelligent and eco-friendly technologies"". He added that, while this is a ""quite interesting catchphrase"", it is going to take time for these types of industries to take off, partly because ""these sectors of China's economy are relatively small"", and ""the problem is that China faces some serious challenges, thanks to an underperforming economy"". He said that the new emphasis on technological innovation may pay off in the long term, but that ""in the short term, China remains dependent on infrastructure spending and a wobbly property market"". One interesting aspect of Mr Xi's ""new productive forces"" was when he told the Politburo in January that such forces would be ""freed from traditional economic growth mode and productivity development paths"", which would seem to suggest that the coming high-tech breakthroughs could be organised by and for the Party. According to the former Chief Economist at multinational investment bank UBS, George Magnus, ""this emphasises the party's leadership, control and power to leverage 'new productive forces' for ideological work. This, in turn, means an industrial policy that serves to strengthen the Party's dominance in the economy's core digital and scientific spaces"". Professor Lee sees the use of this phrase as important because it shows that ""Xi is determined to reinvigorate the Chinese economy after setbacks from its real estate sector and the ongoing trade tensions with the West"" and said that it ""may signal a turning point"". This mass political gathering starts with a marathon speech from the Premier, in which he reads out the Government Work Report, which summarises - in a very formulaic fashion - how China has performed over the past 12 months over a wide range of areas: the economy, the environment, in agriculture and so on.  Then it moves on to what the Party's plan for the next year is. This is a key place to pick up any shifts in government thinking, but a magnifying glass may be required to spot it amongst the mountain of jargon. During the NPC, there will also be a series of highly choreographed press conferences in which only screened questions are permitted and virtually all answers rehearsed.  Over recent years, the Party has also placed fake foreign correspondents into these press briefings, who seemingly represent the international media but are really from front companies based overseas but controlled by Beijing. ""The days of relatively candid press conferences from various ministries and provincial delegations on the side lines of the Congress are pretty much gone,"" said Mr McGregor. This vast meeting may be an elaborate show - with loyal delegates head down in turgid reports - but that doesn't mean it will be without important developments. According to Dr Taylor, ""while the Congress tends to be a decidedly performative autocratic exercise, there are elements of policy innovation and promulgation that bubble up"". These are trying times for China, he said.  The country ""faces several challenges that it will continue to struggle with this year: encouraging foreign direct investment in the midst of decoupling, systemically addressing local government debt, restoring private sector confidence, developing greater technological and scientific self-reliance, and ramping up consumer demand"". There are significant problems facing this superpower and the moment for answers is upon it."
Volatility,Chief executive of troubled council to leave role,2024-09-25,2024-03-13,Josh Sandiford,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgev51qwl0zo,"The chief executive of crisis-hit Birmingham City Council has announced she will stand down at the end of the month.  Deborah Cadman OBE was appointed to the role in March 2021.  In an email to staff on Wednesday, she said she was ""incredibly disappointed with the council’s current financial position"". Professor Graeme Betts CBE, Ms Cadman's deputy, will be acting chief executive while a permanent replacement is sought, the authority said.  This month the council signed off on a wave of cuts to services ahead of a 21% rise in council tax over two years. It came after bosses announced last September that they could not afford to meet their financial obligations. Facing an immediate budget shortfall of £87m, it was forced to issue a section 114 notice - effectively declaring itself bankrupt.  The council currently faces a budget gap of £300m over two years, is £1.25bn in debt to the government, has to face equal pay liabilities of up to £867m and worked up an overspend of more than £130m on an under-fire IT system. In the message to staff, Ms Cadman said she was appointed three years ago with a brief of delivering the Commonwealth Games in the city.  She said the international sporting event was an outstanding success and one of the best ever held.  But the council boss, who previously served as the chief executive of the West Midlands Combined Authority, admitted it was always her intention to leave once the 2024-25 financial budget was agreed. “I joined the council after a period of significant volatility that saw the organisation have four chief executives in only two years,"" Ms Cadman told staff.  ""I have endeavoured to bring stability to the organisation including making permanent appointments to senior roles such as the directors of children’s services and housing, which has led to improvements in performance.""  Ms Cadman added it had been the honour of her life to serve the city where she was born and raised. Her last day at the authority will be 22 March.  Council leader John Cotton said: ""These have been incredibly difficult times and no one can doubt Deborah’s commitment to the council, the city and the region.” Lead commissioner Max Caller, brought in by the government to oversee the council's financial rescue operation, said Ms Cadman had responded effectively over the last six months. ""I wish Deborah well for the future as she continues her long and distinguished career in public service,"" he said. A spokesperson for the council confirmed Ms Cadman had resigned.  A statement added she would not receive any financial package ""in excess of her contractual entitlement and her pension has not been enhanced"".  Two months ago I sat across a table from Birmingham City Council’s chief executive and asked her, on camera, if she had considered leaving her role. The response was an unequivocal and resounding no. She spoke of her pride in being Birmingham-born and her desire to lead the organisation through this unprecedented crisis. So what’s changed?  It’s true we have reached an obvious milestone with the budget signed off this month. A nice tidy point in time to announce ""my work is done, time for someone else"". We know there have been calls for heads to roll over the financial crisis at the council. We know there’s an inquiry on the horizon into who is to blame. But just eight weeks ago, there was no flicker of doubt in the chief executive’s eyes.

Volatility,House prices see biggest drop in 14 years - Halifax,2024-09-25,2022-12-07,By Kevin Peachey,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63886983,"UK house prices saw their biggest drop in 14 years in November, falling 2.3%, reflecting ""volatility"" in the market, according to mortgage lender Halifax. November marks the third month in a row during which prices have fallen with potential buyers playing safe by delaying purchases. The average UK house price in November was £285,579. Higher mortgage rates, economic uncertainty, and the rising cost of living are all affecting the market. The annual rate of growth in property prices has now dropped from 8.2% to 4.7%. Kim Kinnaird, director of Halifax Mortgages, said: ""While a market slowdown was expected given the known economic headwinds - and following such extensive house price inflation over the last few years, this month's fall reflects the worst of the market volatility over recent months. ""Some potential home moves have been paused as homebuyers feel increased pressure on affordability and industry data continues to suggest that many buyers and sellers are taking stock while the market continues to stabilise."" However, she said that the falls should be put into context, given the rapid increase in property prices in the last few years. Property prices were up more than £12,000 compared with this time last year, and £46,403 higher than in March 2020 when the Covid pandemic began. The Halifax said Wales and the South West of England had recorded particularly sharp slowdowns in annual house price growth.  Both had been at the forefront of house price inflation during the pandemic, when the so-called race for space among buyers boosted demand for rural or coastal properties. The Halifax survey, based on the lender's own data, comes shortly after the rival Nationwide Building Society said prices fell 1.4% from October to November - the largest month-on-month fall since June 2020. Mortgage rates are much higher than at any time during the last decade, although earlier this week, the average rate on a new, fixed-rate two or five-year deal fell below 6% for the first time for two months. Tomer Aboody, director of property lender MT Finance, said: ""With another fall in property prices in November, buyers and sellers are clearly demonstrating more caution due to higher mortgage rates and the ever-rising cost of living.  ""As with any fall in pricing, buyer sentiment and confidence is key. But considering the macro-economic and seasonal factors affecting all consumers, along with the month-on-month increases seen over the past 18 months or so, the decline needs to be put into context as it is still minimal."""
Volatility,"Scottish prisons are full, 'we can't take any more'",2024-09-25,2024-02-05,By Lucy Adams,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-68152057,"The head of the Scottish Prison Service has said the jails are too full and she may soon have to say ""enough is enough, we cannot take any more"". Teresa Medhurst told BBC Disclosure prisons were reaching a ""tipping point"" and emergency powers could be needed to release inmates early. She said if numbers continued to rise, drastic measures could be needed as soon as next month. The prison boss said ""all options would need to be on the table"". There are currently about 8,000 people behind bars in Scotland but that is projected to rise to 8,700 this year. Ms Medhurst said that if the numbers went above 8,500 then the Scottish government would have to consider releasing hundreds of prisoners with no restrictions placed on them like it did during Covid. ""If I have to say enough is enough then it is because we are at a tipping point,"" she said. ""We cannot take any more. Prisons become very unsafe. The atmosphere, the tension, the volatility increases. Levels of violence increase, levels of self-harm increase.""  The prison chief said the prison service was looking to double the number of inmates released early on electronic tags to reduce numbers - and considering pre-fab housing blocks to increase capacity.  She also said Police Scotland was being asked to look at how it could divert more people away from court and efforts were being made to tackle the backlog in prisoners on remand. The number of people in prison awaiting trial in Scotland has increased to record levels and almost a quarter of inmates have not been convicted. This is one of the reasons the overall population is rising. David Gray is in HMP Perth on remand, awaiting trial, and said overcrowding and mental health problems were a bad combination. ""They just don't have the numbers or manpower to deal with the scale of the problem in here,"" he said.  ""Another part of it as well is toxic masculinity where men, especially the kind of men in here, don't want to talk about their problems.  ""It's a bad mix, services not being there if people do want to talk, and ones who just don't want to in general. Combined with drug use."" Ms Medhurst told Disclosure: ""At the moment I'm confident that we can manage between now and the spring time.""  But she said projections for March-April made her ""less comfortable"" that the service could cope. To see the impact of overcrowding we were allowed unprecedented access to film in HMP Perth for five days, Over the past 20 years I've been into many of Scotland's prisons as a journalist but the access is usually highly restricted.  For this programme, I was allowed into every part of the prison and much of the week was spent walking about the halls talking to prisoners - many of whom have not been convicted and are awaiting trial.  Residential manager and prison officer Craig Stewart was one of those who escorted me around the jail, Scotland's oldest, which still uses halls built by French prisoners during the Napoleonic Wars. The ratio of staff to prisoners on the halls is about one officer to 23 prisoners.  Officers and inmates tell us hyper-vigilance is a necessary part of everyday survival. During recreation time all the men are out of their cells.  While walking around C hall with Officer Stewart, there were 42 men, some getting showered or playing table tennis and pool.  Officer Stewart explains that this particular hall has every type of prisoner from petty thieves to serious organised criminals and murderers.  My camera operator, producers and all the other officers were behind a grill gate at the far end of the hall about 50m away as we walked around the hall.  The mood was calm but Officer Stewart says it can turn to violence with the ""flick of a switch"" and for just a moment, I got a sense of how frightening and volatile it can be. The most startling thing is the constant noise of the place and how every person seems less menacing and more human than you would ever imagine if you read what they had done in the past.  Many of them speak of remorse and wanting to make amends.  Chris Martin is one of those who says he wants to leave his mistakes behind him. He started doing heroin when he was 15 and has been in prison more than 30 times.  He has gone through recovery in HMP Perth and is getting out soon.  ""I'm getting a job. I want to start a family,"" he said. ""That is living to me. That is life."" ""I want to just be able to live a normal lifestyle."" Brian Kinloch is in HMP Perth remand awaiting trial. He was one of the 662 prisoners in Perth when we went in. The prison capacity is 630. He grew up in care and has seen the impact of self-harm and suicide during his time here. ""Since I've been in I've been trying to access mental health which has been very difficult. It'll be a seven-month waiting list,"" he told the BBC.  ""It's difficult for most people. There was a suicide just there. A young boy, 24-year-old. This is more like a mental health facility than a prison. Like I said, the boy down there didn't have seven months in him."" Perth & Kinross Health & Social Care Partnership said Brian was offered mental health input but disengaged with services.  It said the current waiting times for routine mental health appointments could be up to seven months. Urgent patients are seen within 24 hours. Prisons On The Brink is available here on BBC iplayer. Lucy Adams investigates the impact of overcrowding, drugs and suicides on inmates and staff, and asks whether our crumbling prison estate can cope much longer. Watch now on BBC iPlayer (UK Only) or watch on BBC One Scotland at 20:00 on Monday 5 February.  Prof Sarah Armstrong at the University of Glasgow published figures at the end of 2022 showing Scotland has a significantly higher rate of suicides and drug deaths in jail than England and Wales.  Last year she found there were 41 deaths in Scottish prisons.  ""I do feel like the state of the prison system right now at this moment is not safe,"" she said. ""Over the last three years there have been suicides in every single prison within Scotland, every single one. That's unusual. I mean, that is not something to be proud of."" Figures obtained by BBC Disclosure show self-harm in Scottish prisons is up by almost 40% in the past year - from 587 incidents to 818. Ms Medhurst said that was because of growing tensions as a result of overcrowding.  Inside Perth prison, we met Kieran Wallace in a cell that was built in the early 1800s which he shared with another inmate. Kieran is on remand, awaiting trial.  ""It would be hard enough for one person, never mind two,"" he said.  The European Committee for the Prevention of Torture says that cells shared by prisoners need to be above 8m² so they are not inhuman and degrading.  Kieran's cell is less than 7m² and he spends 19 hours a day locked inside it with another prisoner. Andy Hodge, the governor at Perth, said: ""The pressure of population is forcing us to put more people into one room. That's a real stretch. Two adult men into a room where you've got one TV, one kettle, tensions start to build, people start to fall out. ""Violence amongst the residents starts to go up."" He said there was contingency planning which could see the Scottish government beginning an early release scheme if the numbers get too high. Kate Wallace, the head of Victim Support Scotland, said inmates were reoffending when they leave prison because many of them were not managing to get onto rehabilitation programmes. BBC Disclosure has found there are 698 prisoners currently on a waiting list. ""Victims overwhelmingly tell us that the most important thing,"" she said.  She said rehabilitation was vital to prevent offenders creating more victims when they come out of prison. Justice Secretary Angela Constance said ministers were looking at contingency measures and investing in community sentences to try to reduce the prison population. She said: ""I would very much accept that as a consequence of a rising prison population, that that has an impact on progression, it has an impact on rehabilitation. And that is why addressing a rising prison population is also a matter of community safety."" Additional reporting by Katie McEvinney and Mona McAlinden.

Volatility,"Scottish Water could hike prices further, boss says",2024-09-25,2024-02-05,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-68204002,"An 8.8% rise in water bills this April could be followed by future hikes in the coming years, Scottish Water's chief executive has warned. Alex Plant said the scale of the challenge facing the publicly-owned company meant further investment would be needed. However, he denied hikes have been agreed for 2025 and 2026, stressing that increases are decided on annually.  Rates had already risen by 5% in 2023 and by 4.2% in 2022.  Asked on the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme if Scots should be planning for rates increases in the coming years, Mr Plant pointed out that in 2021 the Water Industry Commission for Scotland, an independent regulator, had recommended above-inflation rises until 2027.  He said that changes to rates in 2022 and 2023 had been reduced due to the pandemic and associated cost of living pressures.  Asked whether people should be planning for price hikes, Mr Plant said: ""If you look at the scale of the challenge in front of us, yes that is the general sense - we're going to have to, as a nation, find ways in which we continue to invest at a greater rate than we have been thus far. ""So that is the kind of future we are facing.""  Water charges are collected along with council tax in Scotland meaning bills will rise in April despite the Scottish government's council tax freeze. The size of the water bills varies with council tax bands, but Scottish Water said the average household would see an increase of £35.95 a year, or about 70p per week. Mr Plant said Scottish Water's infrastructure, some of which was built in the Victorian era, was not designed to withstand ""volatility"" in the weather caused by climate change. He cited recent flooding, as well as droughts.  He said: ""This is all about putting the investment in place that can mean we can keep providing resilient services to customers across the country."" The chief executive said last year's 5% increase had been below inflation. He added: ""At some point you can't keep kicking the can down the road because otherwise services suffer and you'll be leaving future generations having to pick up the tab for the investment we should be making now.""  Mr Plant said decisions about rates were made annually and ""whatever circumstances may prevail at the time would be taken into account by the board"". "

Volatility,Biden promises 'no new Cold War' with China,2024-09-25,2022-11-14,By Tessa Wong,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-63628454,"US President Joe Biden has promised there will be no ""new Cold War"" with China, following a conciliatory meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping. He also said he did not believe China would invade Taiwan. It was the first in-person meeting between the two superpower leaders since Mr Biden took office. The pair also discussed North Korea and Russia's invasion of Ukraine at the talks in Bali, a day before the G20 summit on the Indonesian island. Both said they opposed the use of nuclear weapons in Ukraine. Mr Xi, who has been urged to talk down Vladimir Putin, reiterated China's calls for peace while adding there was ""no simple solution to a complex problem"". Mr Biden said in his press conference ""it's difficult to say that I'm certain that China could control North Korea"". But he also told Mr Xi that China had ""an obligation"" to dissuade Pyongyang from engaging in another nuclear weapons test. Taiwan was a major focus during their three-hour meeting at a luxury hotel shortly after Mr Xi's arrival. Claimed by Beijing, the self-governed island counts the US as an ally, and has always been a thorny issue in US-China relations.  Tensions spiked in August when US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan. China responded with large-scale military exercises around the island, prompting fears of a possible conflict between the US and China. A readout to Chinese state media on Monday said Mr Xi had stressed that Taiwan remained ""the core of China's core interests… and the first red line in US-China relations that cannot be crossed"". In recent weeks US officials have warned that China may escalate plans to invade Taiwan.  Reporters on Monday asked Mr Biden if he believed this to be true, and if he thought a new Cold War was brewing. ""I absolutely believe there need not be a new Cold War. I have met many times with Xi Jinping and we were candid and clear with one another across the board. I do not think there is any imminent attempt on the part of China to invade Taiwan,"" he said. ""I made it clear we want to see cross-strait issues to be peacefully resolved and so it never has to come to that. And I'm convinced that he understood what I was saying, I understood what he was saying."" Mr Biden said the two leaders had agreed to set up a mechanism where there would be dialogues at key levels of government to resolve issues. Secretary of State Antony Blinken will also be visiting China soon, he said. He added that he had made it clear to Mr Xi that ""our policy on Taiwan has not changed at all. It's the same exact position that we have had"".  Mr Biden has repeatedly said the US will defend Taiwan if it is attacked by China. It has been seen as a departure from the long-held US policy of ""strategic ambiguity"" over Taiwan, under which it does not commit to defending the island. Officials have rowed back on his statements.   Mr Xi, in China's readout, called on the US to ""be consistent with its words and actions"" over Taiwan. The US has long walked a tightrope over the Taiwan issue. A cornerstone of its relationship with Beijing is the One China policy, where Washington acknowledges only one Chinese government - in Beijing - and has no formal ties with Taiwan. But it also maintains close relations with Taiwan and sells arms to it under the Taiwan Relations Act, which states that the US must provide the island with the means to defend itself. Mr Biden also raised concerns about human rights issues in China, including the treatment of the Uyghurs in Xinjiang, Hong Kong and Tibet. Both leaders strove to signal to each other - and to the rest of the world watching their meeting - that they were aware that global stability rested on relations between their two countries, and that they would act responsibly. In recent days Mr Biden and US officials have been at pains to signal their aim of conciliation, stressing repeatedly that the US does not want conflict with China, while maintaining a sense of strong competition. Mr Xi appeared to be on the same page, acknowledging in the meeting's opening remarks that ""we need to chart the right course for the China-US relationship"", given that ""the world has come to a crossroads"". Later in the Chinese readout, Mr Xi said that ""China-US relations should not be a zero-sum game in which you rise and I fall… the wide Earth is fully capable of accommodating the development and common prosperity of China and the United States"". Wen-ti Sung, a political scientist who teaches with the Australian National University's Taiwan Studies programme, noted that there were ""few substantive agreements"". Both leaders get a win, he said. ""Xi shows he's not intimidated by Biden, like US and China are true equals."" Meanwhile Biden is given a pass on ""the US pushing the envelope on Taiwan, and the two sides agreeing to improve dialogue reassures other countries"".  Political scientist Ian Chong of the National University of Singapore said: ""The tone I think was overall positive. There's some recognition that there's common interests, and these include not letting the relationship spiral out of control.  ""But I would still be somewhat cautious. Given the volatility in China-US relations, they have starts and stops."""
Volatility,Covid patients in hospitals at highest levels yet,2024-09-25,2020-12-10,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-55259497,"The number of Covid patients in hospital in Wales is the highest yet recorded. There were 1,936 Covid-19 patients in hospital beds on Wednesday, this was 153 more patients than the week before - according to the latest NHS Wales figures. It has risen in all areas, with Aneurin Bevan seeing the biggest increase and it has the most patients too - 592. They include a record number - 585 - who are recovering from the virus.  Recovering patients were not counted until the end of May but the numbers in hospital are now at the highest levels since then.  Covid-19 patients make up about 24% of all patients in hospital. This compares with about 18% at the end of May and the proportion has been slowly increasing. But hospital admissions are holding steady - at an average of 71 a day over the past week. NHS Wales said Covid admissions had ""generally decreased"" since the start of November although there was volatility and fluctuations. There were 75 patients in critical care - slightly more than the week before. With new records being set each day, it's easy to understand why the NHS, especially in parts of Wales, is struggling. Staff are facing a triple whammy of pressures. Firstly, they're having to deal with the increasing burden of Covid - with rates of new infections surging across the country. Secondly, many of their own colleagues are either off work because they have Covid or having to isolate because of infections in their households - with one in 10 NHS staff here now estimated to be off work. The impact of stress and exhaustion is also having an effect. And thirdly, the NHS having approaching the time of year when usual winter pressures are at their most severe. In a typical winter, hospitals struggle when people medically fit enough to leave can't because of delays in arranging social care. It means hospitals quickly fill up, because patients are flowing in more quickly than beds are becoming available. This year there's an added pressure of course - with hundreds (record numbers) of hospital beds now filled with patients who are taking a long time - several weeks or more -  to recover from the virus."
Volatility,South Africa uproar as minister sacked,2024-09-25,2015-12-10,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-35059563,"This video can not be played Impact of sacking of Nhlanhla Nene The decision by South Africa President Jacob Zuma to sack the finance minister has been widely criticised. South Africa's currency fell close to a record low against the dollar on Thursday morning as the markets were digesting the news. BBC Africa business reporter Lerato Mbele says that Nhalnhla Nene's attempt to rein in spending may have unsettled some people loyal to the president. The sacking comes as South Africa's economy is struggling to grow. Africa Live: BBC news updates President Zuma said Mr Nene was being moved to ""another strategic position"", external, but did not elaborate on the reasons behind the decision. He has replaced him with the relatively unknown David van Rooyen. The rand fell to below 15 to the dollar on Thursday morning and stock prices also fell in Johannesburg as trading began, Reuters reports. ""The removal of a technocratically sound, decent, hard-working, well respected, fiscally conservative and reform-minded finance minister is a  serious blow,"" Peter Montalto, an analyst at  Nomura, told the AFP news agency. South Africa's main opposition leader Mmusi Maimane criticised the sacking on Twitter, external saying that Mr Zuma ""has again proven himself to be a President incapable of making the right decisions"". Another opposition party, the Economic Freedom Fighters, said the president appointed Mr Van Rooyen because he knows he ""will not stand up to him when he wants to do wrong things, external"". President Jacob Zuma has been widely criticised over the sacking Shock, surprise and sarcasm dominate the reaction to the sacking of Mr Nene.  A cartoon called ""Zuma's wrecking ball"" of the president's head, cast in stone, butting everything in sight is being widely shared on social media. The general feeling is that President Zuma has dismissed a minister who stood for integrity and prudence in managing the country's finances. Although Mr Nene was finance minister for just over 18 months, he has already been able to stand his ground on issues of wasteful government expenditure. He has openly criticised wage increases for public servants; questioned the management of public utilities; opposed a bailout for the national airline and did not approve a proposal to buy the president a new private jet. In the main, investors regarded him as a safe pair of hands steering South Africa's economy in uncharted waters, especially in the midst of the recent global volatility and the steep decline in commodity prices. South Africa's finance ministry has come under ""the most intense political pressure in recent months"", reports the economic news website Fin24, external. It suggests that Mr Nene's removal was down to his lack of ""politcal clout"".

Volatility,SA rift over finance minister sacking,2024-09-25,2017-03-30,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-39451040,"This video can not be played South Africa's night of the long knives South Africa's Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa has described the sacking of Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan as ""totally unacceptable"".  His late night dismissal on Thursday led to a 5% plunge in the value of the currency, the rand. Mr Gordhan was seen as a bulwark against corruption in an administration that is facing growing criticism. He was one of several victims as President Jacob Zuma conducted a major overhaul of his cabinet. Mr Zuma said the midnight reshuffle was about a ""radical socio-economic transformation"". Mr Ramaphosa told public broadcaster SABC that he would not resign in response to the sacking but continue to ""serve the people"". Africa Live: Updates on this and other stories Fallout from South Africa's ministerial 'massacre' Mr Gordhan remained defiant in the wake of his sacking Pravin Gordhan was seen by many as a safe pair of hands when it came to managing the economy. He was keen to keep a tight rein on spending and resisted calls from the president to increase government expenditure. This was Mr Gordhan's second stint as finance minister after first serving from 2009 to 2014. He was reappointed in 2015 to replace little-known David van Rooyen. Mr Van Rooyen's selection was controversial and he was in place for less than a week. It is unclear why Mr Gordhan was sacked but local media are pointing to an alleged intelligence report which accuses him of working with foreigners to undermine Mr Zuma's administration.  In a spirited farewell press conference at the treasury's office in Pretoria, Mr Gordhan defended his economic record, and dismissed speculation that he had recently held meetings in London aimed at undermining the president. Referral to his dismissal and that of his deputy Mcebisi Jonas he said: ""Our souls are not for sale."" Mr Gordhan and Mr Zuma did not see eye to eye on government spending, the BBC's Milton Nkosi reports, and that led to a rift between them. Ultimately, though, this is being seen as a political issue with the president rewarding loyalists. Earlier this week, the president recalled his finance minister from planned events in the UK. Last October, Mr Gordhan was charged with fraud, but the charges were later dropped. He has described the allegations as politically motivated. Cyril Ramaphosa, Jacob Zuma and Pravin Gordhan pictured just last month on budget day Comments by the Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa that Mr Gordhan's sacking was ""totally unacceptable"" captures the overwhelming sentiment of some top leaders in the ruling African National Congress (ANC).  ANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu said Mr Gordhan and his deputy Mcebisi Jonas had integrity and were incorruptible. The Anglican Archbishop of Cape Town, Thabo Makgoba, has said the cabinet sackings ""constitute an assault on the poor of South Africa"".   ANC Youth League leader Collen Maine has however praised the cabinet changes calling the new Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba ""experienced and intelligent"". Demonstrators came out in the capital, Pretoria, in response to the news of Pravin Gordhan's sacking The rand is experiencing a setback just when it had started to recover from the political uncertainty and international volatility that plagued it in the past year.  The bond markets, this is where government debt is sold and the values are directly linked to the prospects of the economy have also reacted negatively. For foreign investors that is a boon, but for South African taxpayers subsidising the state it does not represent value for money.   Ultimately ordinary people will feel the pressure of these political moves, a weaker currency means the cost of basic imports such as fuel and some foods will go up.  A country whose reputation is dented, may ultimately lose face with international ratings agencies and finally be downgraded to ""junk status"" when the economic assessments are done again in June.   Apart from the nine ministers who have been affected by the changes Mr Zuma also appointed 10 deputy ministers.  Sfiso Buthelezi will become Deputy Finance Minister, replacing Mcebisi Jonas. ""I have directed the new ministers and deputy ministers to work tirelessly with their colleagues... to ensure that the promise of a better life for the poor and the working class becomes a reality,"" President Zuma's said in a statement.

Volatility,UK economy shrinks after rain and strikes hit,2024-09-25,2023-09-13,Michael Race,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-66785572,"The UK economy shrank more than expected in July, driven by strike action by NHS workers and teachers, according to official figures. Wet weather also hit the construction and retail industries, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said, causing the economy to contract by 0.5%. The figures were worse than analysts had predicted and continue a trend of weak economic growth in the UK. But the ONS said the ""broader picture"" for the country looked ""more positive"". Darren Morgan, director of economic statistics at the ONS, said that while July saw the economy shrink, output across the services, production and construction sectors had grown 0.2% in the three months to July. He said ""a busy schedule"" of sporting events and increased theme park visits had provided a slight boost to the economy. The drag on the economy for July was partly due to a fall in output from the services sector, which includes the NHS. The ONS said the drop was driven by the industrial action, with senior doctors and radiographers striking over pay on two days each, and junior doctors walking out on five days in the month. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said the latest economic figures showed ""many reasons to be confident about the future"" and that the UK economy was now on course to grow faster than Germany, France and Italy. The figure produced by the ONS to show the health of the UK economy is known as gross domestic product (GDP). GDP is a measure - or an attempt to measure - all the activity of companies, governments and individuals in a country. If the figure is increasing, it means the economy is growing and people are doing more work and getting a little bit richer, on average. But if GDP is falling, then the economy is shrinking which can be bad news for businesses. If GDP falls for two quarters in a row, it is typically defined as an economic recession. The UK is currently not in recession, but there have been concerns over the economy's weak performance in recent months. Rachel Reeves, Labour's Shadow Chancellor, said the new statistics on Wednesday marked ""another dismal day for growth"" and that the ""Conservatives' low growth trap"" was ""leaving working people worse off"". Annie Rose, owner of horse riding company Cumbrian Heavy Horses, said July's wet weather affected her business because about 40% of her customers are tourists. ""When they have consistently poor weather, they'll go and do other things that are inside or they'll go on low level walks around a lake, that's not going to cost them a lot of money. Not sit on a horse in the pouring rain,"" she told the BBC. She said many recreational riding stables had closed in the UK ""simply because horse riding is expensive"" and keeping the animals is proving too costly. She said the cost of hay to feed her horses had trebled from around £4,000 to more than £12,000 last winter, piling further pressure on her budget. Paul Dales, chief UK economist at forecaster Capital Economics, suggested that July's economic figures could mean a ""mild recession"" has begun. but added he expected the Bank of England to raise interest rates a final time from 5.25% to 5.5%. The Bank has been hiking rates in a bid to control the rate at which consumer prices in the UK have been rising, known as inflation.  The economic theory behind increasing rates is that by making it more expensive for people to borrow money, they will then have less excess cash to spend, meaning households will buy fewer things and then price rises will ease. But it's a balancing act as raising rates too aggressively could cause a recession. Inflation fell to 6.8% in the 12 months to July, but the level is still more than three times the Bank's 2% target. Households have been grappling with higher prices for everything from food to energy in recent times and wage growth, on average, has only just caught up with the rate of inflation for the first time in nearly two years. But with interest rates at the highest level for 15 years, the cost of borrowing including for loans such as mortgages has soared, although people with savings should benefit and get better returns on their money. The latest GDP figures released are an estimate of how the economy is doing by the ONS. It produces one of the quickest estimates of GDP of the world's major economies, about 40 days after the quarter in question.  At that stage, only about 60% of the data is available, so the figure is revised when more information comes in, and can change at a later date. Much as we all like to moan about the weather, there was more than abnormally heavy rainfall impacting July's GDP figures. While these are just an initial stab at estimating what activity was up to based on limited data, and could be a blip, the numbers are a reminder that we may be looking at a dampening for the economy.  Strikes - in health, education - impacted certain sectors. The pattern of bank holidays this year has caused some volatility in monthly numbers too. A wetter July for activity was perhaps inevitable after an economically glowing June. Such volatility is why economists prefer to look at trends over quarters - and activity did still perk up between May and July as a whole. It was consumer spending that drove a resilient economy in the first half of the year - and that continued in some areas in July. Attendance at the likes of sporting activities and festivals did well. But was that partly down to true grit, a determination to brave the weather after splashing out on tickets and to treat ourselves after the lockdown years? Or could it be a last splash? As fixed rate mortgages deals end, over half of residential mortgage holders and a bigger slice of landlords with buy-to-let loans have been exposed to higher interest rates, monthly repayments rising typically by hundreds of pounds. The forthcoming data will be scrutinised as closely as meteorologists do their weather charts. "
Volatility,UK economy shrinks for the first time since 2012,2024-09-25,2019-08-09,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-49290926,"The chancellor has told the BBC that he does not expect the UK to slide into recession after data showed the economy shrank by 0.2% between April and June. Sajid Javid was speaking after the Office for National Statistics said the economy had contracted for the first time since 2012. The surprise decline came after Brexit stockpiles were unwound and the car industry implemented shutdowns. The pound sank after the data was released, raising fears of a recession. Against the dollar sterling fell to $1.2025. Against the euro, it dropped throughout the day to €1.0736, a level not seen since the global financial crisis a decade ago. Rob Kent-Smith, head of GDP at the ONS, said manufacturing output fell and the construction sector weakened. A recession occurs when the economy contracts in two consecutive quarters. This is the first contraction since the fourth quarter of 2012. Economists had not been forecasting a contraction in the economy in the second quarter, but had expected it to stagnate, with the consensus forecast for 0% growth. The economy had shown 0.5% growth in the first quarter after manufacturers' stockpiling ahead of Brexit helped to boost output, when the manufacturing sector recorded its biggest quarter rise since the 1980s. The ONS said GDP had been ""particularly volatile"" so far this year because of the changes to activity sparked by the original Brexit date of 29 March.  The statistics body said its latest figures showed that those increased stockpiles had been partly run down in the second quarter and that a number of car manufacturers had brought forward their annual shutdowns to April as part of contingency planning, which also hit growth. Mr Kent-Smith said: ""Manufacturing output fell back after a strong start to the year, with production brought forward ahead of the UK's original departure date from the EU."" He added that ""the often-dominant service sector delivered virtually no growth at all"". Mr Javid told the BBC: ""I am not expecting a recession at all. And in fact, don't take my word for it. There's not a single leading forecaster out there that is expecting a recession, the independent Bank of England is not expecting a recession. And that's because they know that the fundamentals remain strong."" The Bank said earlier this month it expects the economy to grow by 1.3% this year, down from a previous projection of 1.5% in May. Asked about the impact of Brexit, he said: ""We saw some significant stockpiling by British businesses in anticipation of the Brexit that never was, and now they're using those stockpiles, they're coming down.  ""Of course, there are businesses out there that are taking Brexit into account when they're making decisions."" He said: ""No one will be surprised by today's figures."" The data comes at a time when there are signs other economies are slowing. For instance, data on Friday showed that French industrial output fell more than expected in June. Mr Javid said: ""This is a challenging period across the global economy, with growth slowing in many countries.  ""But the fundamentals of the British economy are strong - wages are growing, employment is at a record high and we're forecast to grow faster than Germany, Italy and Japan this year."" But John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said the ""dismal economic figures are a direct result of Tory incompetence"". ""The Tories' Brexit bungling, including Boris Johnson now taking us towards no-deal, is breaking the economy."" The Liberal Democrats were also concerned about the impact of a no-deal Brexit. ""Pursuing a no-deal Brexit is a political choice without a mandate: these figures show people's jobs and livelihoods are being sacrificed at the altar of political extremism, "" said Chuka Umunna, the party's Treasury and business spokesperson. Mr Javid said the best way to deal with Brexit uncertainty was to leave the EU on 31 October, with or without a deal. ""We're seeing volatility in the figures and one of the best ways to actually end this volatility is to bring certainty around Brexit and make sure we leave on 31 October."" The employers' body, the CBI, said the contraction was ""concerning"". Alpesh Paleja, CBI lead economist, said: ""Growth has been pushed down by an unwind of stockpiling and car manufacturers shifting their seasonal shutdowns. ""Nonetheless, it's clear from our business surveys that underlying momentum remains lukewarm, choked by a combination of slower global growth and Brexit uncertainty.  ""As a result, business sentiment is dire."" The Federation of Small Businesses - which is calling for an emergency Budget - said that if the Treasury delays action until after 31 October, the date for Brexit, its efforts are likely to prove too little, too late.    ""Time is of the essence. Unless the chancellor steps in imminently with radical action, we could be heading for a chaotic autumn - and a very long winter,"" said the FSB's policy and advocacy chairman, Martin McTague.  Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said the data showed ""an economy in decline and skirting with recession  as headwinds from slower global growth are exacerbated by a Brexit-related paralysis"". Geoffrey Yu of UBS Wealth Management said that while the global picture was ""becoming more gloomy"", anyone looking for positive signs for the economy could look to ""robust private consumption, reflecting a healthy labour market"". Household spending rose 0.5% on the quarter. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, agreed that household spending was still growing at a ""robust rate"" and said it was not time to panic. He said the stockpiling was dragging on the economy, which was ""sluggish and had not stalled"". The pound - which has been at two-year lows following Brexit uncertainty - fell after the data was released. The currency also falls if there are expectations that interest rates will be cut. Mr Tombs said the market now sees a 70% chance of an interest rate cut in January, when Mark Carney is due to leave as the Bank of England's governor."
Volatility,UK borrowing higher than expected in February,2024-09-25,2024-03-21,Tom Espiner,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68610677,"Government borrowing in February was higher than expected, according to official figures. Borrowing was £8.4bn, in part because of higher benefits payments such as cost-of-living support.  Economists had predicted that borrowing would come in at £6bn for the month. However, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the February number was £3.4bn lower than a year earlier, as the growth in tax receipts exceeded growth in spending. It was also the fourth consecutive month where borrowing was down on the previous year. The government tends to spend more than it raises in tax. To fill this gap it either borrows money, raises taxes, or cuts spending. To borrow money the UK government sells financial products called bonds or gilts. A bond is a promise to pay money in the future. Most require the borrower - the government - to make regular interest payments over the bond's lifetime.  Debt, which is the total amount of money owed by the government that has built up over years. remains at levels last seen during the early 1960s as a percentage of the UK's economic output. In February, debt was 97.1% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), which is a measure of output. However, in February interest payable on debt fell by £1.1bn to £6.8bn, mainly because interest on government bonds is linked to one of the measures of inflation - the retail prices index, which had dropped. One of the government's key pledges is that debt should be falling as a percentage of GDP in five years' time. According to the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) - an independent body that looks at the government's plans on tax and spending - that pledge is on track to be met. However, debt is forecast to keep rising until 2028-29. The larger than expected budget deficit in February was a result of a variety of factors including cost-of-living payments, an inflation-linked increase in benefits and a rise in government spending on goods and services as a result of higher inflation.  Chief secretary to the Treasury Laura Trott said that it was ""right that this government provided billions of pounds to support individuals and businesses during Covid, and pay half of people's energy bills after Putin's invasion of Ukraine"". She added: ""Because of the difficult decisions we have taken, the economy is turning a corner, inflation is falling and wages are up."" But Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell, said: ""Just weeks after Jeremy Hunt announced supposed vote-winning tax cuts amid speculation that further giveaways are in the offing, it emerges the government has had to borrow more than had been expected for the month of February."" While cost-of-living support payments are due to end, she said uprated benefit costs would ""have to be factored into the sums of any chancellor making tax and spend decisions for the future"".  Nevertheless, she said, with borrowing down for the fourth month in a row: ""There are tentative signs that the volatility created by the pandemic and the energy crisis is behind us, though the legacy left behind will weigh on public finances for generations to come."""
Volatility,Anger over 'unfair' A-level results,2024-09-25,2020-08-12,"Sean Coughlan, Katherine Sellgren, Judith Burns ",https://www.bbc.com/news/education-53759832,"There is anger among schools, colleges and students, after nearly 40% of A-level grades awarded on Thursday were lower than teachers' predictions. In England, 36% of entries had a lower grade than teachers predicted and 3% were down two grades, in results after exams were cancelled by the pandemic. School and college leaders are calling for a review and say all fees for appeals should be waived. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the results were a ""robust set of grades"". The overall results, across England, Northern Ireland and Wales, show record highs for A* and A grades. But David Hughes, chief executive of the Association of Colleges, said he had heard from a number of colleges where more than half of their school-assessment grades have been adjusted downwards following moderation. Paul Whiteman leader of the heads' union  NAHT said: ""The government must make sure that there is no financial barrier to a school or college making an appeal."" Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union said: ""While there had been an overall increase in top grades, there was a ""great deal of volatility among the results at school and student level."" He said students felt grades had been pulled down ""in a way that they feel to be utterly unfair and unfathomable"". He called on the government and exams watchdog Ofqual to review the moderation process in England ""as a matter of urgency"". ""We would warn them against simply digging in their heels, and insisting all is well. ""This results day must have been an absolute nightmare for many schools, colleges, and young people - it is a shambles."" For the top  A* and A grades, independent schools in England saw the greatest improvement on last year - up 4.7 percentage points. This compares with a 1.7, 2 and 0.3 percentage points improvement for top grades for England's academies, comprehensives and colleges respectively. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said pupils would be able to sit exams if they feel they could have done better.  ""Where pupils are disappointed, where they feel that they could have done better, where they feel that there's an injustice been done to them, there is the possibility of appeal and they can re-sit, they can take a re-sit this autumn as well."" ""But looking at the big picture, I think overall we've got a very robust set of grades, plus you've got the situation in which more pupils than ever before are getting their first choice course at university and more kids from disadvantaged backgrounds going to university."" Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said the ""majority of young people will have received a calculated grade today that enables them to progress to the destination they deserve, with the added safety net of being able to appeal on the basis of their mock results, as well as the chance of sitting autumn exams"". But Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said: ""Something has obviously gone horribly wrong with this year's exam results. ""Nearly 40% of young people have had their grades marked down and that's thousands of young people whose opportunities could have been dashed."" The exam results show: The proportion of entries getting an A* or A grade is at a record high this year - with the 27.9% above the previous highest of 27% in 2011. And there are increases in those getting A* to C - as the exam regulator had promised a more lenient approach. At Wilberforce Sixth Form College in Hull, while some students were celebrating, others were very disappointed. Abbi is one of those students who is not happy with her results, saying she had missed out on her place at Durham University to study engineering. She said she would now have to consider retakes or finding a clearing place at another university. ""It seems like some unfair grading. When I opened them I had a bit of a cry,"" she told the BBC. ""My future has been set back completely,"" she said. ""I had my heart set on Durham and it's now not an option for clearing because there's no clearing for my course."" ""I would have happily sat the exams but it was up to the government,"" she said, adding that she was angry her results had been affected by something out of her control. Principal Colin Peaks said he had never seen ""such a negative feeling"" on results day in all his years of teaching. Mr Peaks said there was ""something worrying across the board"", with many good students not getting the grades they would have expected. ""The anomalies within the system aren't right - I'm seeing anomalies across the piece that do not make sense to me."" He said basing results, in part, on last year's students' results was wrong because ""they're different"". ""We are going to see lots of appeals,"" he added. Students taking vocational exams have been getting estimated results over recent weeks - with more than 250,000 receiving their grades in BTec and Cambridge Technical qualifications which are equivalent to A-levels and strong GCSE passes. The Department for Education says vocational results are ""broadly in line with previous years"". Figures from the admissions service, Ucas, show that more students have been accepted onto UK degree courses this year. Among UK applicants, 358,860 have been accepted - a 2.9% rise compared with 2019. Of these, 316,730 have been accepted on to their first choice, up 2.7% on the same point last year. Clearing is an increasingly popular route for students to find a degree course, with leading universities among those offering last-minute places through the system, Ucas said. By Sean Coughlan, education correspondent  This is a strange year for A-level results in every way, with grades arriving for exams that were never taken. In more usual times the headlines would have been about this being a record year for top grades - with almost 28% getting A*s or As. But instead this has been an exam results day full of uncertainty, with head teachers warning about volatility below the surface of rising grades. Almost two out of every five results were lower than the grades predicted by their teachers - and heads are warning of a confusing pattern of where results have gone down. But, at the same time, those trying to get to university might find that they're able to get in with lower grades than in previous years, with the promise of ""super-flexible"" admissions. The confusion extends to what happens next. Because for those getting bad news today, it could still be good news through the appeals process. Have you got your A-level or BTec results today?

Volatility,Why so many US 'mass shooting' arrests suddenly?,2024-09-25,2019-08-23,Holly Honderich,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-49439539,"In the last three weeks US authorities have arrested at least 28 people accused of threatening acts of mass violence. What's behind this surge and could they all be convicted?  The threats ranged from posts on social media and video gaming sites to verbal comments to colleagues and friends. In at least two cases, suspects sent text messages to ex-partners. Hoards of weapons were also found in some cases. The FBI won't say what is behind the steep bump in apprehensions, some carried out by that agency, others by local police. It's not clear if it marks a growth in threats or simply a rise in awareness and tip-offs. But former FBI boss Andrew McCabe said on Friday there was undoubtedly a ""renewed awareness"" focused on the sort of threats that a few months ago might have been ignored by investigators mindful of the right to free speech as enshrined in the US Constitution. The first amendment offers broad protection of free speech, even if that speech is racist or of a violent nature. Prosecutions in the US are further complicated by the second amendment which safeguards the right to bear arms. So what can be done to stop a shooter before they strike?  More than two dozen people are reported to have been arrested for making threats to carry out mass violence since the 3 August shooting in El Paso. Many of the alleged plots foiled by US law enforcement included plans to target specific minority groups. But without any federal penalties in place for acts of domestic terrorism - like those that exist for international terrorism - the charges varied - false threats, terrorist threats, illegal possession of weapons and disorderly conduct.  It's unclear how these various cases will fare at trial. For charges asserting threats of violence, the threats must be highly specific, accompanied by evidence of imminent danger.  ""The whole test is whether something is a clear or present danger,"" says Martin Stolar, a civil rights lawyer based in New York. You must be expressing a clear intention to commit a crime, he continued, and close to committing it. A case in Vermont shows how tricky it can be to prosecute. Jack Sawyer, 18, was arrested in 2018 after he threatened to cause mass casualties at his former high school. A friend had informed police, who searched his car and found a 31-page diary entitled Journal of an Active Shooter.   The state's attorney charged Mr Sawyer with four felonies - two counts of attempted aggravated murder, and one count each of attempted first-degree murder and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, among the most serious charges in Vermont.  But within months, all four felony charges were dropped. Mr Sawyer walked free in April 2018 and has now been adjudicated as a youthful offender for carrying a dangerous weapon. He will remain under state supervision until he turns 22.  The court found that he had stated his intentions to commit harm but no action followed, says Vermont-based lawyer David Sleigh. ""Simply contemplating a crime is not a crime in Vermont.""  All states have laws that bar violent threats. Threats made by US mail or interstate commerce, for example, are considered criminal. But those threats generally must include the incitement or solicitation of specific violent acts to be considered criminal.  ""You don't criticise someone for speaking, you criticise people for picking up a gun,"" says Mr Stolar. ""When speech crosses the line.""  Without a designated target, an immediate timeline, or clear preparations to commit assault, violent words may be protected speech.  There must be ""action and imminent danger,"" Mr Sleigh says. ""As opposed to trying to criminalise evil or unpalatable thinking."" In terms of free speech protections, the US is singular.   ""In some countries, they've criminalised certain types of hate speech that are protected here,"" says Mary McCord, a former senior national security prosecutor, now legal director at Georgetown University's Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection.  ""They have a tool available in those countries to prevent some of the type of speech that can be used to recruit new adherents to an ideology.""  What about other countries? In the UK, for example, an expression of hatred related to a victim's race, religion, disability, sexual orientation or gender identity is illegal.  In Canada, too, there are more restrictions on free speech than in the US. The federal criminal code includes multiple provisions barring hate speech, including those that impose criminal sanctions against anyone who willfully incites hatred in public against an identifiable group, including those distinguished by race, sexual orientation, or mental or physical disability.  Such sensitivities ""present barriers,"" Ms McCord says, ""to effectively combat the spread of violent ideologies."" But in the US, she continues, ""we respect the first amendment.""  The implications of the first amendment are complicated by the second, which enshrines the right to gun ownership.  In many of the recent arrests, suspects were found in possession of firearms and other weapons. But even where suspects were found with a hoard of firearms - like 18-year-old Justin Olsen, who was found with more than a dozen rifles and 10,000 rounds of ammunition - the cache of weapons uncovered were legally acquired, and do not provide grounds to prosecute.  ""If a person's not prohibited for having a weapon, he could have a bunch of weapons, he could not be breaking any laws at all,"" says Ms McCord. She has drafted a proposal to criminalise the stockpiling of weapons for use in a domestic attack.  ""That would enable the government to prove his intent,"" says Ms McCord, giving law enforcement an additional tool to thwart potential offenders before they act. Without standing law specifically addressing domestic terrorism, ""law enforcement has to find something to charge [suspects] with because there's nothing that directly applies. They're cobbling things together to charge.""  Ms McCord is among a growing number of those within the intelligence community calling for domestic terrorism to be classified as a federal crime, giving law enforcement expanded preventative powers - similar to those that apply to international terrorist groups.  But some civil rights advocates and attorneys balk at giving the US government any more power. They argue that existing laws, when enforced, are sufficient.  ""I think the rush to try to expand police authority into regulating rights of free speech or rights to gun ownership should be taken very, very carefully,"" Mr Sleigh says.   Does the combination of the first and second amendment create a volatility that does not exist elsewhere, he asks.  ""I suspect it does. But it's been part of our national project to embrace that liberty and freedom, knowing that it comes with risk."" "
Volatility,New mortgage deals being pulled within days,2024-09-25,2024-03-18,Kevin Peachey,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68574065,"Mortgage deals are typically on offer for just 15 days before being pulled, despite homeowners and buyers having the widest choice for 16 years. This is the shortest shelf-life in six months, according to financial information service Moneyfacts. As a result, people have little time to decide when rates are volatile. One adviser said the situation was adding extra stress to a huge financial commitment and making customers feel pressured to make a decision quickly. ""When I recommend a rate - or sometimes a choice of rates - to a client, it's quite understandable and unsurprising that they want time to consider which one to apply for,"" said Jo Jingree, from Mortgage Confidence.  ""Some lenders only give a few hours' notice of a rate change. That creates a situation which is less than ideal because taking out a mortgage can be a huge financial commitment that could impact them for years to come."" The interest rate on a fixed mortgage does not change until the deal expires, usually after two or five years, and a new one is chosen to replace it. Doing nothing would leave people on a variable rate, which is very expensive. About 1.6 million existing borrowers have relatively cheap fixed-rate deals expiring this year, so need to make their minds up.  Johnny Abbott, from Loughborough, falls into that category and is watching deals with increasing concern.  The 39-year-old and wife Sophie, who have three children, are weighing up whether to get a new mortgage when their current deal comes to an end in July. The alternative is to move to a slightly bigger home that needs renovating, and where the mortgage is only slightly higher. Everything, Mr Abbott admits, feels like a gamble at the moment. Unless rates start to fall soon, they will have to cut back on costs whichever option they choose. That means no holiday, fewer swimming lessons for the children, no gym or TV subscription. ""We don't have a massive income, but we feel grateful to be where we are - able to manage costs, and not drowning in them,"" the charity debt centre manager said. ""We will just have to do what we can to make things stretch."" Meanwhile, potential first-time buyers require a new mortgage deal to be secured before they can think about setting up home. Many are left frustrated by trying to predict the direction of mortgage rates - the interest that is charged on a home loan. Lenders have been switching rates at a rapid pace as the markets try to predict whether or not the Bank of England will cut the benchmark interest rate, the key influence on the cost of many types of borrowing. Investors expect the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee to hold rates on Thursday and to make fewer, and later, changes to the base rate of 5.25% this year than previously anticipated. Cuts in this rate, which is at a 16-year high, makes borrowing cheaper. For those looking for a new mortgage, the current situation is like shopping in a hypermarket, but where everything on the shelf is soon going out of date. Previously, the choice has been more one of a convenience store. At the start of March, there were 6,000 mortgage products to choose from, according to Moneyfacts, which is the widest selection since 2008.  Lenders have extended their ranges, may offer various extras such as cashback, and - crucially for many first-time buyers - have more products for those who can only offer a relatively small deposit. The trouble is, the volatility in the market means deals are only around for a few days. The average of 15 days is well down from 28 days at the start of February, and only just above the record low of 12 days last July.  Lenders, aware of what rivals are doing, may pull deals at short notice. There has been huge upheaval in the mortgage market, not least after the mini-budget of September 2022, during the premiership of Liz Truss, and with plummeting activity from buyers last year. Homeowners actually repaid more money on mortgages than they took out in new lending in the year to January - the first time this has happened since comparable records from the Bank of England began 30 years ago. Mortgage broker Aaron Strutt, from Trinity Financial, said some calmness had returned, but the average interest rate had been going back up. ""It is good news that borrowers have so many [mortgage deals] to choose from again. The only shame is that they are so much more expensive than they were,"" he said. The average rate of a two-year fixed deal is now 5.8%, according to Moneyfacts. This had been well above 6% late last year, fell to 5.55% in late January, but has been creeping up since.

Volatility,Food prices rise at fastest rate in 42 years,2024-09-25,2022-10-19,Lora Jones,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63301383,"UK food prices are rising at their fastest rate in 42 years as the cost of living crisis continues to squeeze household budgets.  Food costs jumped 14.6% in the year to September - the biggest rise since 1980 - with bread, cereal, meat and dairy prices all climbing.  It comes as people also struggle with higher energy and transport costs. Overall inflation - the rate at which UK prices rise - surged to 10.1% last month and is expected to climb further.  The prices of most key items in the average household's food shopping basket went up last month, including fish, sugar, fruit and rice, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.  Experts say the rise in the cost of groceries has been accelerated by the war in Ukraine, which has disrupted grain, oil and fertiliser supplies from the region. Food and drink prices have also been affected by the recent weakness in the pound, which has made imported products and ingredients more expensive. Karen Betts, chief executive of the Food and Drink Federation, said: ""Food and drink manufacturers continue to do everything they can to keep product prices down, but huge rises in ingredient, raw material, energy and other costs mean they have no choice but to pass some price rises on."" According to the ONS, overall inflation is back at the 40-year high seen in July after dipping to 9.9% in August.  It said the cost of furniture and hotel stays had also risen - although these were partially offset by the falling price of petrol and airline tickets. It comes as a BBC survey uncovers growing concern about the squeeze on finances. Some 85% of those asked are now worried about the rising cost of living, up from 69% in a similar poll in January.  As a result, nine in 10 people are trying to save money by delaying putting the heating on. The Bank of England says inflation could peak at 11% in October, after inflation figures have factored in the big rise in energy bills that came in at the start of this month.  Jen Welch, who runs artisan bakery Bread&, says the situation is ""scary"" as her costs rise rapidly. She set up the bakery in Sunderland during the pandemic and thought that would be the toughest experience she would face. But the cost of her key ingredients such as flour, butter and oils have ""spiralled out of control"" and they face energy bills of more than £1,000 a month. ""You think to yourself, if we can [get through the pandemic], we can weather most storms,"" she told the BBC. ""But maybe that's not the case."" The latest official figures come as new Chancellor Jeremy Hunt attempts to tackle the rising cost of living, as well as the recent turmoil on financial markets sparked by his predecessor's mini-budget. As a result of the volatility, mortgage prices have hit a 14-year high, driving up costs for millions at a time when energy and food bills are also rising. Mr Hunt said the government said he understood people were struggling and would ""prioritise help for the most vulnerable while delivering wider economic stability"". But shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said: ""Inflation figures this morning will bring more anxiety to families worried about the Tories' lack of grip on an economic crisis of their own making."" Experts said the latest inflation figures would put extra pressure on the Bank of England to hike interest rates at its next meeting in November. By raising rates the Bank aims to encourage people to save more and spend less, in the hope this will stop prices rising as fast. It has increased rates seven times in a row since December as it tries to bring inflation back down to its 2% target.  But higher rates also drive up borrowing costs for mortgage holders and businesses, with experts warning this could put a brake on economic growth. The rise in the cost of living is expected to peak this October, when government support to freeze energy bills at £2,500 for an average household comes into play. But that help is expected to be reduced from April as the government looks to plug a hole in the public finances, leading to warnings that bills could go above £4,000. Mr Hunt has promised to protect the most vulnerable but not said what help they will get, or whether those on higher incomes will be supported.  In addition, while the prime minister confirmed she would increase pensions in line with inflation, she has not committed to do the same for benefits. "
Volatility,Cost-of-living rally calls for action on poverty,2024-09-25,2022-04-02,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-60967943,"Protesters have gathered in Glasgow to call for action to tackle the cost-of-living crisis.  About 200 people took part in the rally at George Square a day after the energy price cap increased by 54%.  Similar events were staged across the UK organised by the Trades Union Congress and the People's Assembly.  Scottish TUC deputy general secretary Dave Moxham said there was ""growing anger"" and ""despair"" following the latest energy price cap rise.  Protests were prompted by fears that the rising bills could lead to physical and mental health issues as people ration their use of gas and electricity.   The rise in the energy cap means a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity will now pay £1,971 per year. The cap, set every six months for England. Wales and Scotland, is designed to protect domestic customers from the volatility of wholesale energy prices. The 4.5 million customers on prepayment meters facing an even bigger increase of £708 a year. Mr Moxham said: ""I think there is real growing anger, I think there is a lot of despair.  ""We think the anger is going to grow and grow as people come to terms with the terrible cost-of-living crisis that they are facing."" Official figures suggest four in 10 bill-payers have been finding it difficult to afford their energy costs. Council taxes and water bills are also going up for many people, added to the rising cost of food and household items. One estimate suggests that a typical consumer is now facing a £73 a month increase in bills, of which about £58 is from rising energy costs. One of the speakers at the rally, Annie McCormack from the Kinross charity Broke Not Broken, a member of the independent food aid network, said it was becoming a ""survival crisis"" for some of the families they were helping. ""We talk to other food banks and we are all seeing an increased need in support with food, support with gas and energy, mental health support,"" she said.  ""We're terrified as a charity and we have people coming in who are experiencing huge amounts of anxiety to do with what's going to come in the future.  ""We were already seeing a cost-of-living crisis. What we're concerned about now is that people are actually going to experience a cost-of-survival crisis."" She said people in poverty were ""incredibly creative with how far they can make their money go"" but would be left with nothing to work with.  Chris Birt, Scotland's associate director for Scotland for the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme the chancellor had to act. ""These are tough choices for the chancellor,"" he said.  ""He sits on top of a massive budget with an ability to borrow, which is far easier than the ability of somebody who doesn't have any income to borrow, so people end up in dangerous debts, in debt to the DWP, and why anyone is in debt to the state at the moment is beyond me. ""He has to take action."""
Volatility,Energy price hikes come into effect in Northern Ireland,2024-09-25,2022-07-01,Clodagh Rice,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-62003738,"Energy price hikes are coming into effect across Northern Ireland from Friday which will put further pressure on the cost of living. The increases - which will add as much as £375 onto typical annual bills - will mean tens of thousands of customers will have to pay more for their gas and electricity. The wholesale cost of energy has soared over the last 12 months because of volatility on global energy markets.  That is being passed on to customers.  Increases, which have been previously announced, include: Experts say there is no sign of any downward movements, and these higher energy prices could be with us for some time. Aodhan O'Donnell, from energy comparison site Power to Switch, said that when comparing to this time last year, ""the average electricity deal was £400-500, now it's £800 so there's a significant increase there"". ""When you look at gas, the average deal from today is about £1,300,"" Mr O'Donnell said.  ""This time last year it would have been around £600, so that's the impact these increases are having when you look at a year-to-year basis. ""Alongside that, the home heating oil price has also been above £1 a litre for some time now. ""I think people might not feel the full effect of that for some time now because it's July, but as soon as it comes into September, into the colder months, we'll certainly be finding people will struggle and prices are likely to stay high."" In April, BBC News NI spoke to Lee Martin and his mum Caroline Wheeler in Enniskillen.   Lee has a rare genetic disorder and relies on machines to help him breathe. His bed, toilet, CPat machine and nebuliser - everything in his home requires electricity.  His mum Caroline said the latest increase was adding to the pressure. ""It's scary to even think of what's to come down the line,"" she said. ""Lee is on Economy 7 here and got a little reprieve when the weather turned good that he could switch off a couple of heaters.  ""But because he suffers with a lot of kidney infections he needs to keep the heat up, but to think what's going to come down the line at Christmas or winter if there's a cold snap.  ""It's already £100 a week. To hike it again, you're talking about £20-30. ""That's going to cut into his benefits. He already has to pay for his care £103 a week, so he is already well past the breadline, so he is in the red now and it's life-threatening. ""Anybody who needs this much equipment to stay alive, there should be more done for them."" The Consumer Council said it was currently speaking to consumers every day ""who are upset and worried about the winter ahead"".  Its director of infrastructure and sustainability, Peter McClenaghan, said the price increases taking effect on Friday ""will impact more than half of Northern Ireland's households"". ""We urge anyone who is struggling to pay their energy bills or to top-up their meter, to contact their supplier directly for help with payment plans for bill pay / direct debit and prepayment meters,"" he said.  Mr McClenaghan also issued some advice over the financial support recently announced by the Chancellor aimed at helping pensioners, people with disabilities, and those on qualifying benefits.  ""We know people are desperate for that support and we would ask those who will receive these funds, if you can, plan for heating your home this winter when deciding how to use the money you receive in July,"" he said.  ""There is also an urgent need for clarity on, if, how, and when the Chancellor's £400 energy support package will be made available everyone in Northern Ireland."" Meanwhile, in the Republic of Ireland, Electric Ireland has announced that it will increase residential gas bills by 29.2% and residential electricity bills by 10.9% from next month. Broadcaster RTÉ reports that this equates to an an average of €13.71 (£11.88) per month on the average electricity bill and €25.96 on the average gas bill."
Volatility,Money-off energy scheme launches to avoid blackouts,2024-09-25,2022-11-04,Michael Race & Emma Simpson,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63483668,"Households will be offered discounts on their electricity bills if they cut peak-time use on a handful of days over the winter, as part of National Grid's efforts to avoid blackouts. The network operator has announced details of the scheme, which it said could save households up to £100.  There will be 12 ""test"" days initially, designed to see how customers respond, between November and March. But only homes with smart meters will be able to take part. Only 14 million, less than half, of households in England, Scotland and Wales, where the scheme is being tested, have a smart electricity meter installed. Customers taking part will be given 24 hours' notice of a ""test"" day where they will be asked to reduce their peak-time electricity use if they can during a one-hour period identified by National Grid, likely to be between 16:00 and 19:00. That could include delaying use of a tumble-dryer or washing machine, or cooking dinner in the microwave rather than the oven. National Grid said it will pay energy suppliers, which will be required to sign up to the scheme to operate it for customers for a smart meter, £3 for every kilowatt-hour during the test periods. Smart meters replace your existing gas and electricity meters and measure the energy you use at home. The big difference is that they send this information directly to your supplier over wireless networks in real-time. Suppliers say that this means you pay only for what you use, so bills are more accurate than estimated ones. It also means you can monitor your usage more closely and adjust your habits if you're looking to save money. But if you live in an area with weak signal, your meters might struggle to communicate with your supplier effectively. Individual suppliers will decide how much customers will receive and whether the money is taken off bills, credited to accounts, or if there's an option to withdraw the cash. National Grid is testing the idea, which it calls its ""Demand Flexibility Service"", at scale for the first time, to establish a system that can serve as an ""insurance policy"" if it needs to ease demand on the grid this winter. Households have been warned of power cuts lasting up to three hours at a time if gas supplies run extremely low, and National Grid is hoping the new scheme can, along with other measures, prevent that happening. The electricity network operator said the service had been approved by the UK's energy regulator Ofgem, which meant electricity suppliers and providers could sign up and then advertise the scheme to customers. It is understood many of the UK's larger energy firms are looking to take part in the trial, after being consulted in recent months on how it would work. The scheme is also open to businesses which could, for example, change production schedules or switch to batteries or generators at peak times.  Jake Rigg, director of corporate affairs at National Grid ESO, said by signing up people could ""back Britain"" as well as saving money and reducing carbon emissions. ""It's not a big thing or a difficult thing to do, just remembering to do it 12 times this winter and get that money back, when we are all really struggling with energy bills and the cost of living generally,"" he told the BBC. ""We can all do our little bit, we can shift demand out of that peak and help maintain security of supply throughout the winter."" Octopus Energy has already announced it will participate. It operated a trial scheme with 100,000 customers earlier this year, offering a much smaller discount for people who shifted their energy use away from peak times. It believes there will be more days on offer - 25 in total compared to 12 planned so far - for households to be given the chance to cut down on energy use as the UK goes through the winter. Octopus Energy said that 350,000 customers had signed up in advance of the latest test days. Its boss, Greg Jackson, said: ""Let's be very clear: this is an historic moment - we're entering a new era of energy in which households are moving from passive off-takers to active enablers of a smarter, greener and cheaper grid."" He suggested that the service could mean ""we make blackouts a thing of the past, and bring costs down for everyone."" Dunkan Armstrong, an Octopus Energy customer based in Edinburgh, took part in the trial of the new scheme and said he was asked to reduce his energy usage for a couple of hours a day. A retired IT architect, he set up a system where his dishwasher and washing machine only switched on overnight. ""If I reduced usage by 40% between 4pm and 6pm I would get all of the electricity I used in that period for free."" He said that he enjoyed the challenge although he did not save a huge amount of money. The financial incentive has now gone up and he adds: ""I would still do it anyway, for the sake of me turning off my energy so others who desperately need it don't have to experience blackouts."" National Grid said Russia's invasion of Ukraine had created ""unprecedented turmoil and volatility"" in the energy markets in recent months. Gas flows from Russia to Europe have been disrupted since its invasion of Ukraine, leaving countries scrambling for alternative supplies, which could have a knock-on effect on Britain.  The UK is heavily reliant on gas to produce electricity, with gas-fired power stations generating more than 40% of the country's electricity. The UK also imports electricity from continental Europe. National Grid's central view remains that there will be enough energy to provide Britain with similar levels of electricity to previous winters. It said its service is aiming to save two gigawatts of electricity, which is enough to power about one million homes.  The company has also put coal-fired power stations on standby in case they are required to boost energy generation. Additional reporting by Emma Pengelly."
Volatility,Typical energy bill set to rise by £800 a year,2024-09-25,2022-05-24,Michael Race,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-61562657,"The typical household energy bill is set to rise by about £800 a year in October, the energy regulator warns. Ofgem boss Jonathan Brearley said the energy price cap, which limits how much providers can raise prices, is expected to increase to £2,800 a year, due to continued volatility in gas prices.  Mr Brearley said the price rises were a ""once in a generation event not seen since the oil crisis in the 1970s"". He added the number of households in fuel poverty may double to 12 million. A household is in fuel poverty when it has to spend 10% or more of its disposable income on energy.  The energy price cap already rose sharply in April to £1,971, meaning that homes using a typical amount of gas and electricity are now paying an extra £700 per year on average. Mr Brearley told the business select committee of MPs that Ofgem was only part way through reviewing prices ahead of setting the next cap in October, but added: ""We are expecting a price cap in the region of £2,800.""  It means the typical household bill could rise by £800 per year. Ofgem's price cap covers England Wales and Scotland. Northern Ireland does not have a price cap, but households have also been witnessing sharp price rises. Mr Brearley said that conditions in the global gas market had ""worsened"" following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which has led to concerns about potential supply issues. He warned that the price cap could rise beyond £2,800 if Russia - one of the world's largest exporters of natural gas - decided to disrupt supplies. ""We are really managing between two versions of events,"" he said. ""One where the price falls back down to where it was before, for example if there's peace in Ukraine, but one where prices could go even further if we were to see, for example, a disruptive interruption of gas from Russia."" Europe gets about 40% of its natural gas from Russia, so sudden supply cuts could have a huge economic impact. While the UK would not be directly impacted by supply disruption as it imports less than 5% of its gas from Russia, it would be affected by prices rising on global markets as demand in Europe increased.  ""The price changes we have seen in the gas market are genuinely a once-in-a-generation event not seen since the oil crisis of the 1970s,"" Mr Brearley told the Business select committee. But the Ofgem boss apologised for regulatory shortcomings and admitted had financial controls been in place sooner for suppliers, fewer firms would have gone bust due to being unprepared for the sharp rise in wholesale prices. We are all getting used to bill shocks when it comes to paying for gas and electricity - but this could be the biggest of all. Regulators do not usually give such early indications of the costs to come, which makes the seriousness of the situation all the more obvious. Some 23 million households have their domestic energy bill governed by the price cap. In April, they typically started paying £700 a year more. In October, according to Mr Brearley, it could be a further annual rise of £800. The trouble is, the old way of tackling this is as a billpayer was to shop around for a better tariff. That option is no longer available. Analysts say the average price of the cheapest 10 fixed tariffs on the market is £3,685 a year - clearly a poor financial choice. So that leaves people to budget and use savings as best they can, and leaves ministers under even greater pressure to offer more support, especially during the colder, darker, more expensive months ahead. Later on Tuesday, the Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng told MPs people will have to ""wait and see what's forthcoming"" from the chancellor and the prime minister on further help on energy bills as he said economic growth was the ""time honoured way"" to help people. Mr Kwarteng said the government had put forward £9.1bn in support for energy bills, including council tax and energy bill rebates, and an extension of the Warm Home Discount. He added that the government had been waiting to see where gas prices were heading before making a decision on further assistance. ""What we see now isn't the full picture. Both the prime minister and the chancellor say there is more to do, and we have to see what is forthcoming"", Mr Kwarteng told the committee. The Labour committee chairman, Darren Jones, asked the business secretary if he thought ""bill payers are happy with that answer? Just wait and see?"". Mr Kwarteng acknowledged it was ""a difficult time"" and ""people are under huge stress"" but added that ""nobody is suggesting that the government can pay the entirety of the energy bill"".  ""What we are committed to is giving support, and that's what we're doing,"" he said. Asked by Mr Jones what he thought about the prospect of a one-off windfall tax on oil and gas companies, Mr Kwarteng said he didn't think it supported investment. In response to Ofgem's price cap forecast, Downing Street acknowledged that energy prices were a ""significant challenge"", but said the government was ""actively looking at what more could be done in this space"". Meanwhile, Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves questioned: ""How many more alarm bells does the chancellor need to hear before he acts? ""The government have got to get a grip on this crisis and to protect families and our economy."" Ms Reeves repeated her party's call for a windfall tax on oil and gas firms' profits to help lower bills for households. Recently, Shell reported a record £7bn profit in the first three months of this year while BP made £5bn, the highest for 10 years.

Volatility,Charities warn fuel poverty could double in a year,2024-09-25,2022-03-04,Kevin Peachey,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60619726,"The number of fuel poor households in the UK will double in a year if the crisis in Ukraine leads to higher energy bills, charities are warning. Analysts are predicting that the war has pushed up wholesale prices, and could mean the average domestic bill in the UK hits £3,000 in October. National Energy Action said that would put 8.5 million households in serious financial difficulty from fuel bills. That would be twice the number of a year earlier, equating to 30% of homes.  Charity Age UK said such an increase would have a ""devastating"" impact on the health and wellbeing of older people, many of whom could go without heating for weeks. The cost of gas and electricity for the typical household, on a tariff governed by the energy regulator Ofgem's price cap in England, Wales and Scotland, is already rising by 54% to nearly £2,000 from the start of April. Prices are also rising sharply in Northern Ireland. A string of energy analysts have predicted that the conflict in Ukraine, and the knock-on for gas supplied by Russia, could have a relatively sustained impact on the wholesale price of energy. UK suppliers, and ultimately consumers, are not immune to those global price rises, even though Russia only provides about 5% of the UK's gas supplies. Analysts have suggested that could be reflected in the next calculation of Ofgem's price cap, which would take effect at the start of October. Many, including the suppliers' own trade body, say the average household bill could get close to, or reach £3,000 a year. National Energy Action, which campaigns for warm, dry homes, said the number of households in fuel poverty was already expected to go up from four million in October 2021, to 6.5 million after April's price rise. That would go up again to 8.5 million in October this year, if the typical bill increases to £3,000. That is a possibility but still far from certain, owing to the volatility of the war, the international picture, and wholesale prices. The charity's definition of fuel poverty is a household which needs to spend more than 10% of their household income on fuel to heat their home to a satisfactory standard. Similar definitions are used officially in parts of the UK, although in England the definition of fuel poverty used by the government is a more complex calculation. When George Mycock, moved to London from Stoke-on-Trent, he ended up having to pay £950 a month for a room in a four-bedroom flat share. With bills included, it works out at about 70% of his monthly income. His flatmates have already seen bills go up by between £50 and £100 each in the last few months. But he says the rise in energy bills is ""scary"". ""We don't know how much we're going to have to pay [on our default tariff],"" he says. ""It's plunged people into uncertainty."" National Energy Action has joined with 50 charity and campaign groups to call for support from the government for financially-stretched bill-payers. The coalition has claimed that further price rises could lead to more people dying prematurely across the UK next winter. ""This is a disaster and, inevitably, will lead to more needless winter deaths. The government must act now, to protect the most vulnerable, and to save lives,"" said Adam Scorer, chief executive of National Energy Action. A government spokeswoman said: ""It is hard to predict what longer term impacts the current situation in Ukraine will have on energy costs. However, the energy price cap will continue to insulate millions of customers from volatile global gas prices  ""We are also taking decisive action to help more than 27 million households with rising energy costs, with a £200 reduction on bills this autumn and a £150 non-repayable reduction in council tax bills."" "
Volatility,Energy bills predicted to drop in October,2024-09-25,2023-08-18,Lora Jones,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-66542340,"Annual energy bills for a typical household are expected to fall slightly to £1,926 from October, according to a new forecast. Consultancy firm Cornwall Insight predicts bills could drop by £148 under a new official price cap set to be announced by Ofgem next week. The energy price cap limits how much suppliers can charge households for each unit of energy they use. But bills still remain far higher than before Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Kate Mulvany, senior consultant at Cornwall Insight, told the BBC's Today programme that while wholesale energy prices had been falling, the drop in bills from October will probably be a little less than consumers were hoping for. ""Unfortunately... our forecasting to the end of this decade is that prices are going to stay higher than people were used to before the energy price crisis."" The energy watchdog, Ofgem, sets a maximum price that suppliers can charge customers per unit of gas and electricity.  It applies to households on variable or default tariffs in England, Wales and Scotland, but the actual amount paid by customers will vary depending on the amount of gas and electricity they use. Changes to the energy price cap come into force every quarter to reflect changes in wholesale prices, and it stood at £2,074 for a typical household in July. The price of wholesale energy increased as Covid restrictions were eased and then rocketed after Russia's invasion of Ukraine last year. In October last year, the government stepped in to limit a typical household's annual gas and electricity bill to £2,500. It also gave a £400 winter discount to every household, which was paid in six instalments between October and March. This support has been wound down, although cost-of-living payments will continue to be made to people on lower incomes and those receiving certain benefits. The End Fuel Poverty Coalition warned that few customers would feel better off, despite the decrease in the price cap. ""Any declines in wholesale costs are almost cancelled out by the end of the government's Energy Bills Support Scheme, which means bills stay at similar levels to last year while people have less ability to pay these stubbornly high prices,"" it said. ""This coming winter will not feel any better than last as energy bills remain at dangerously high levels."" Cornwall Insight warned that it was still important that the government explores alternative options for energy bills, such as social tariffs, to make sure they are affordable. In a statement, Cornwall Insight said that the slow reduction of bills along with the ""volatility"" associated with the energy price cap might mean more customers look to going back to a fixed tariff for their gas and electricity. ""With so many unknowns in the energy market, each household must decide for themselves what is the best avenue for them,"" its principal consultant Dr Craig Lowrey said. It also suggested that the UK was particularly susceptible to changes in wholesale prices because of its reliance on gas imports.  According to Ms Mulvany, one of the big drivers behind the high prices being forecast over the next decade is that nuclear power stations in the UK are expected to retire, so they will stop producing a ""very substantial amount of energy that the UK relies on"". A spokesman for the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said that the government ""will always ensure that the energy market is working for consumers to protect them from sky-high bills and that households are getting the best deal"".

Volatility,Watchdog blamed as energy firm failures push up bills,2024-09-25,2022-06-21,Kevin Peachey,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-61881981,"Energy watchdog Ofgem has been accused of allowing an industry to develop on ""shaky foundations"" in which a series of supply companies collapsed. All billpayers will pay £94 more a year each to cover the £2.7bn cost of the failure of 28 suppliers which folded after wholesale prices soared. The National Audit Office (NAO) said Ofgem had allowed a market to develop that was vulnerable to large shocks. The regulator said it was already addressing the issues raised. Meg Hillier, who chairs the Public Accounts Committee, said: ""Ofgem's approach created an energy market built on shaky foundations. As a result, many companies simply collapsed under the shock of energy price increases. ""Once again, it's the public who has to pay for the mistakes of those charged with protecting them. It's unacceptable."" The result of last year's shock was that 2.4 million customers were automatically moved to a rival company when their own supplier collapsed. Typically, according to Citizens Advice, they had to pay an extra £30 a month for the duration of their original contract, as they were shifted to a more expensive tariff. In addition, the cost of these failures totalled £2.7bn - a tab which was spread across all billpayers in Britain, not just those of the failed companies. This is before taking into account the potentially multi-billion charge that households could face due to the collapse of Bulb Energy, which is in special administration. The NAO said that Ofgem had decided on a ""low bar"" approach for allowing new domestic energy suppliers into the market to encourage competition and choice for customers after the market had been dominated by six big companies. The regulator had then introduced tighter rules for new entrants from 2019, but not for existing suppliers until 2021. As a result, many suppliers lacked the financial resilience to deal with the six-fold increase in wholesale prices seen last year, the NAO said. ""By allowing so many suppliers with weak finances to enter the market, and by failing to imagine that there could be a long period of volatility in energy prices, Ofgem allowed a market to develop that was vulnerable to large-scale shocks,"" said Gareth Davies, head of the NAO. ""Consumers have borne the brunt of supplier failures at a time when many households are already under significant financial strain having seen their bills go up to record levels. A supplier market must be developed that truly works for consumers,"" Mr Davies said. Ofgem is making changes after a review it commissioned came to many of the same conclusions. ""We are already working hard to address all of the issues raised,"" a spokesman for the regulator said. ""While the once-in-a-generation global energy price shock would have resulted in market exits under any regulatory framework, we have already been clear that suppliers and Ofgem's financial resilience regime were not robust enough.  ""While no regulator can, or should, guarantee companies will not fail in the future, we will continue to take a whole-market approach to further strengthen the regulatory regime, ensuring a fair and robust market for consumers which keeps costs fair as we move away from fossils fuels and towards affordable, green, home-grown energy."" The NAO said concerns had been raised that Ofgem's reforms could limit new entrants and innovative ideas in the future. A typical household gas and electricity bill - governed by the energy price cap in England, Wales and Scotland has risen sharply, and now stands at about £2,000 a year. Analysts Cornwall Insight have predicted that the bill could hit about £3,000 a year this winter."
Volatility,Money-off energy scheme launches to avoid blackouts,2024-09-25,2022-11-04,Michael Race & Emma Simpson,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63483668,"Households will be offered discounts on their electricity bills if they cut peak-time use on a handful of days over the winter, as part of National Grid's efforts to avoid blackouts. The network operator has announced details of the scheme, which it said could save households up to £100.  There will be 12 ""test"" days initially, designed to see how customers respond, between November and March. But only homes with smart meters will be able to take part. Only 14 million, less than half, of households in England, Scotland and Wales, where the scheme is being tested, have a smart electricity meter installed. Customers taking part will be given 24 hours' notice of a ""test"" day where they will be asked to reduce their peak-time electricity use if they can during a one-hour period identified by National Grid, likely to be between 16:00 and 19:00. That could include delaying use of a tumble-dryer or washing machine, or cooking dinner in the microwave rather than the oven. National Grid said it will pay energy suppliers, which will be required to sign up to the scheme to operate it for customers for a smart meter, £3 for every kilowatt-hour during the test periods. Smart meters replace your existing gas and electricity meters and measure the energy you use at home. The big difference is that they send this information directly to your supplier over wireless networks in real-time. Suppliers say that this means you pay only for what you use, so bills are more accurate than estimated ones. It also means you can monitor your usage more closely and adjust your habits if you're looking to save money. But if you live in an area with weak signal, your meters might struggle to communicate with your supplier effectively. Individual suppliers will decide how much customers will receive and whether the money is taken off bills, credited to accounts, or if there's an option to withdraw the cash. National Grid is testing the idea, which it calls its ""Demand Flexibility Service"", at scale for the first time, to establish a system that can serve as an ""insurance policy"" if it needs to ease demand on the grid this winter. Households have been warned of power cuts lasting up to three hours at a time if gas supplies run extremely low, and National Grid is hoping the new scheme can, along with other measures, prevent that happening. The electricity network operator said the service had been approved by the UK's energy regulator Ofgem, which meant electricity suppliers and providers could sign up and then advertise the scheme to customers. It is understood many of the UK's larger energy firms are looking to take part in the trial, after being consulted in recent months on how it would work. The scheme is also open to businesses which could, for example, change production schedules or switch to batteries or generators at peak times.  Jake Rigg, director of corporate affairs at National Grid ESO, said by signing up people could ""back Britain"" as well as saving money and reducing carbon emissions. ""It's not a big thing or a difficult thing to do, just remembering to do it 12 times this winter and get that money back, when we are all really struggling with energy bills and the cost of living generally,"" he told the BBC. ""We can all do our little bit, we can shift demand out of that peak and help maintain security of supply throughout the winter."" Octopus Energy has already announced it will participate. It operated a trial scheme with 100,000 customers earlier this year, offering a much smaller discount for people who shifted their energy use away from peak times. It believes there will be more days on offer - 25 in total compared to 12 planned so far - for households to be given the chance to cut down on energy use as the UK goes through the winter. Octopus Energy said that 350,000 customers had signed up in advance of the latest test days. Its boss, Greg Jackson, said: ""Let's be very clear: this is an historic moment - we're entering a new era of energy in which households are moving from passive off-takers to active enablers of a smarter, greener and cheaper grid."" He suggested that the service could mean ""we make blackouts a thing of the past, and bring costs down for everyone."" Dunkan Armstrong, an Octopus Energy customer based in Edinburgh, took part in the trial of the new scheme and said he was asked to reduce his energy usage for a couple of hours a day. A retired IT architect, he set up a system where his dishwasher and washing machine only switched on overnight. ""If I reduced usage by 40% between 4pm and 6pm I would get all of the electricity I used in that period for free."" He said that he enjoyed the challenge although he did not save a huge amount of money. The financial incentive has now gone up and he adds: ""I would still do it anyway, for the sake of me turning off my energy so others who desperately need it don't have to experience blackouts."" National Grid said Russia's invasion of Ukraine had created ""unprecedented turmoil and volatility"" in the energy markets in recent months. Gas flows from Russia to Europe have been disrupted since its invasion of Ukraine, leaving countries scrambling for alternative supplies, which could have a knock-on effect on Britain.  The UK is heavily reliant on gas to produce electricity, with gas-fired power stations generating more than 40% of the country's electricity. The UK also imports electricity from continental Europe. National Grid's central view remains that there will be enough energy to provide Britain with similar levels of electricity to previous winters. It said its service is aiming to save two gigawatts of electricity, which is enough to power about one million homes.  The company has also put coal-fired power stations on standby in case they are required to boost energy generation. Additional reporting by Emma Pengelly."
Volatility,Typical energy bill set to rise by £800 a year,2024-09-25,2022-05-24,Michael Race,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-61562657,"The typical household energy bill is set to rise by about £800 a year in October, the energy regulator warns. Ofgem boss Jonathan Brearley said the energy price cap, which limits how much providers can raise prices, is expected to increase to £2,800 a year, due to continued volatility in gas prices.  Mr Brearley said the price rises were a ""once in a generation event not seen since the oil crisis in the 1970s"". He added the number of households in fuel poverty may double to 12 million. A household is in fuel poverty when it has to spend 10% or more of its disposable income on energy.  The energy price cap already rose sharply in April to £1,971, meaning that homes using a typical amount of gas and electricity are now paying an extra £700 per year on average. Mr Brearley told the business select committee of MPs that Ofgem was only part way through reviewing prices ahead of setting the next cap in October, but added: ""We are expecting a price cap in the region of £2,800.""  It means the typical household bill could rise by £800 per year. Ofgem's price cap covers England Wales and Scotland. Northern Ireland does not have a price cap, but households have also been witnessing sharp price rises. Mr Brearley said that conditions in the global gas market had ""worsened"" following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which has led to concerns about potential supply issues. He warned that the price cap could rise beyond £2,800 if Russia - one of the world's largest exporters of natural gas - decided to disrupt supplies. ""We are really managing between two versions of events,"" he said. ""One where the price falls back down to where it was before, for example if there's peace in Ukraine, but one where prices could go even further if we were to see, for example, a disruptive interruption of gas from Russia."" Europe gets about 40% of its natural gas from Russia, so sudden supply cuts could have a huge economic impact. While the UK would not be directly impacted by supply disruption as it imports less than 5% of its gas from Russia, it would be affected by prices rising on global markets as demand in Europe increased.  ""The price changes we have seen in the gas market are genuinely a once-in-a-generation event not seen since the oil crisis of the 1970s,"" Mr Brearley told the Business select committee. But the Ofgem boss apologised for regulatory shortcomings and admitted had financial controls been in place sooner for suppliers, fewer firms would have gone bust due to being unprepared for the sharp rise in wholesale prices. We are all getting used to bill shocks when it comes to paying for gas and electricity - but this could be the biggest of all. Regulators do not usually give such early indications of the costs to come, which makes the seriousness of the situation all the more obvious. Some 23 million households have their domestic energy bill governed by the price cap. In April, they typically started paying £700 a year more. In October, according to Mr Brearley, it could be a further annual rise of £800. The trouble is, the old way of tackling this is as a billpayer was to shop around for a better tariff. That option is no longer available. Analysts say the average price of the cheapest 10 fixed tariffs on the market is £3,685 a year - clearly a poor financial choice. So that leaves people to budget and use savings as best they can, and leaves ministers under even greater pressure to offer more support, especially during the colder, darker, more expensive months ahead. Later on Tuesday, the Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng told MPs people will have to ""wait and see what's forthcoming"" from the chancellor and the prime minister on further help on energy bills as he said economic growth was the ""time honoured way"" to help people. Mr Kwarteng said the government had put forward £9.1bn in support for energy bills, including council tax and energy bill rebates, and an extension of the Warm Home Discount. He added that the government had been waiting to see where gas prices were heading before making a decision on further assistance. ""What we see now isn't the full picture. Both the prime minister and the chancellor say there is more to do, and we have to see what is forthcoming"", Mr Kwarteng told the committee. The Labour committee chairman, Darren Jones, asked the business secretary if he thought ""bill payers are happy with that answer? Just wait and see?"". Mr Kwarteng acknowledged it was ""a difficult time"" and ""people are under huge stress"" but added that ""nobody is suggesting that the government can pay the entirety of the energy bill"".  ""What we are committed to is giving support, and that's what we're doing,"" he said. Asked by Mr Jones what he thought about the prospect of a one-off windfall tax on oil and gas companies, Mr Kwarteng said he didn't think it supported investment. In response to Ofgem's price cap forecast, Downing Street acknowledged that energy prices were a ""significant challenge"", but said the government was ""actively looking at what more could be done in this space"". Meanwhile, Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves questioned: ""How many more alarm bells does the chancellor need to hear before he acts? ""The government have got to get a grip on this crisis and to protect families and our economy."" Ms Reeves repeated her party's call for a windfall tax on oil and gas firms' profits to help lower bills for households. Recently, Shell reported a record £7bn profit in the first three months of this year while BP made £5bn, the highest for 10 years.

Volatility,Higher energy bills 'almost inevitable' says Ofgem,2024-09-25,2022-03-08,Oliver Smith & Tom Espiner,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60665284,"Households are heading for an ""almost inevitable"" rise in energy bills in the autumn, the boss of energy regulator Ofgem has said. Spikes in wholesale gas prices, which were rising even before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, will be passed on to consumers, Jonathan Brearley said. He called for the shift to green energy to speed up the move away from gas. The UK government has previously said the energy price cap would ""insulate"" customers from gas price rises. Mr Brearley warned in a speech that the gas price volatility caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine would lead to higher costs being passed on to consumers. ""While it is too early to predict what the price cap will be in October, a price increase is almost inevitable,"" he said. The energy price cap is the maximum amount that suppliers in England, Scotland and Wales can charge customers for each unit of energy. It is set to rise in April when millions of households will face an increase in average energy bills of nearly £700.  In October, the price cap will be reset, and Ofgem warned last week that average bills could reach £3,000. Wholesale gas prices, which were already rising rapidly as economies were emerging from the coronavirus pandemic, will be pushed higher by the Ukraine crisis, Mr Brearley said. Russia's invasion of Ukraine underlined that ""it is not in consumers' interests for their energy sources or prices to be so exposed to international gas markets"". Britain's oil and gas supplies are secure due to North Sea reserves, he said. But oil and gas extracted from the North Sea is not owned by the UK itself, but by the oil and gas companies which drill for it. Those products are then sold on the global market which has been volatile, even before Russia's invasion of Ukraine. ""We started winter with an international gas price shock of unprecedented pace, scale and duration,"" Mr Brearley said. ""However, this gas crisis is not over. We are entering a second, more serious phase that will have further consequences for customers and further financial strain for retail companies,"" he added, saying gas had gone up to nearly £7 per therm this week alone. ""It is not in customers' interests for their household bills to be beholden to the uncertainties of geopolitics,"" he said. Some Conservative MPs, most notably the Net Zero Scrutiny Group, have argued for a greater reliance on fossil fuels. But Mr Brearley said we must move away from fossil fuels not only to tackle climate change, but also to move away from volatile prices. He said the UK must move as quickly as possible to low carbon energy. Mr Brearley said it was Ofgem's priority to manage and mitigate the ""inevitable consequences"" of rising energy prices on British consumers but he said that ""as an industry, we cannot pretend that our actions can mitigate the full impact of future price rises"". He said that anyone struggling to pay their bills should contact their energy provider to find out what help was available, but also urged companies to ""reach out"" to their most vulnerable customers and support them where possible.  Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday said that the government will soon set out an ""energy supply strategy"" amid concern over western reliance on Russian gas and oil.  He said the government was looking at using more UK energy resources: ""One of the things we're looking at is the possibility of using more of our own hydrocarbons."" ""That doesn't mean that we are in any way abandoning our commitment to reducing carbon dioxide [emissions]."" ""You can do that, but you've got to reflect the reality that there is a crunch on at the moment and we need to intensify our self-reliance as a transition with more hydrocarbons."""
Volatility,Charities warn fuel poverty could double in a year,2024-09-25,2022-03-04,Kevin Peachey,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60619726,"The number of fuel poor households in the UK will double in a year if the crisis in Ukraine leads to higher energy bills, charities are warning. Analysts are predicting that the war has pushed up wholesale prices, and could mean the average domestic bill in the UK hits £3,000 in October. National Energy Action said that would put 8.5 million households in serious financial difficulty from fuel bills. That would be twice the number of a year earlier, equating to 30% of homes.  Charity Age UK said such an increase would have a ""devastating"" impact on the health and wellbeing of older people, many of whom could go without heating for weeks. The cost of gas and electricity for the typical household, on a tariff governed by the energy regulator Ofgem's price cap in England, Wales and Scotland, is already rising by 54% to nearly £2,000 from the start of April. Prices are also rising sharply in Northern Ireland. A string of energy analysts have predicted that the conflict in Ukraine, and the knock-on for gas supplied by Russia, could have a relatively sustained impact on the wholesale price of energy. UK suppliers, and ultimately consumers, are not immune to those global price rises, even though Russia only provides about 5% of the UK's gas supplies. Analysts have suggested that could be reflected in the next calculation of Ofgem's price cap, which would take effect at the start of October. Many, including the suppliers' own trade body, say the average household bill could get close to, or reach £3,000 a year. National Energy Action, which campaigns for warm, dry homes, said the number of households in fuel poverty was already expected to go up from four million in October 2021, to 6.5 million after April's price rise. That would go up again to 8.5 million in October this year, if the typical bill increases to £3,000. That is a possibility but still far from certain, owing to the volatility of the war, the international picture, and wholesale prices. The charity's definition of fuel poverty is a household which needs to spend more than 10% of their household income on fuel to heat their home to a satisfactory standard. Similar definitions are used officially in parts of the UK, although in England the definition of fuel poverty used by the government is a more complex calculation. When George Mycock, moved to London from Stoke-on-Trent, he ended up having to pay £950 a month for a room in a four-bedroom flat share. With bills included, it works out at about 70% of his monthly income. His flatmates have already seen bills go up by between £50 and £100 each in the last few months. But he says the rise in energy bills is ""scary"". ""We don't know how much we're going to have to pay [on our default tariff],"" he says. ""It's plunged people into uncertainty."" National Energy Action has joined with 50 charity and campaign groups to call for support from the government for financially-stretched bill-payers. The coalition has claimed that further price rises could lead to more people dying prematurely across the UK next winter. ""This is a disaster and, inevitably, will lead to more needless winter deaths. The government must act now, to protect the most vulnerable, and to save lives,"" said Adam Scorer, chief executive of National Energy Action. A government spokeswoman said: ""It is hard to predict what longer term impacts the current situation in Ukraine will have on energy costs. However, the energy price cap will continue to insulate millions of customers from volatile global gas prices  ""We are also taking decisive action to help more than 27 million households with rising energy costs, with a £200 reduction on bills this autumn and a £150 non-repayable reduction in council tax bills.""

Volatility,House cancels DC mayor testimony after campus arrests,2024-09-25,2024-05-08,By Thomas Mackintosh & Nadine Yousif,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68976244,"Police arrested 33 people at George Washington University (GW) early Wednesday after officers moved to clear a pro-Palestinian encampment on campus. Washington DC police told the BBC that protestors were arrested for assaults on a police officer and unlawful entry.  University students had been inside the encampment since 25 April.  House Republicans cancelled scheduled testimony by Mayor Muriel Bowser following the arrests after pressuring DC officials to clear the protests. The police operation came a week after six Republican members of the House of Representatives Oversight Committee visited the GW protest encampment and called on officials to arrest protesters involved. Wednesday's move to clear the encampment was made ahead of a planned appearance by Ms Bowser and Metropolitan Police Department Chief Pamela Smith before the House Oversight Committee on the city's handling of the unrest. In a statement, the Chair of the House Oversight Committee, Republican Representative James Comer, announced that appearance was being cancelled and said he was ""pleased that the potential Oversight hearing led to swift action by Mayor Bowser"".  According to a report on the arrests by GW Hatchet, the university's independent student-run newspaper: ""Officers gave their third and final warning to demonstrators to move at about 03:30 local time, saying all who remained in U-Yard and the stretch of H Street in front of the plaza would be arrested."" The newspaper reported that some protestors who refused to leave were pepper sprayed by police. In a statement, the university said police ""conducted an orderly and safe operation to disperse the demonstrators from the illegal encampment on the GW's University Yard"".  They added there were no reports of serious injuries during the arrests. Previously, despite GW's efforts to offer an alternative protest site, the encampment remained.  University officials say they are unsure how many of the demonstrators were students.  ""While the university is committed to protecting students' rights to free expression, the encampment had evolved into an unlawful activity, with participants in direct violation of multiple university policies and city regulations,"" a previous GW statement said. Tensions had grown in recent days after police removed a large Palestinian flag that demonstrators had raised above a campus building. The university called the flag's hoisting an ""aggressive act of lawlessness"".  Metro Police told the BBC there has been ""a gradual escalation in the volatility"" of the protest and, as a result, officers moved in. ""Therefore, this morning, working closely with the GW administration and police, MPD moved to disperse the demonstrators from the GW campus and surrounding streets,"" the statement added.  GW said it remains open and operating as normal, but additional security personnel have been deployed to University Yard and the surrounding area. The yard will remain closed until the end of commencement ceremonies on 19 May, the university added. There have been heated demonstrations at a number of universities across the country against the war in Gaza.  Since the 7 October attack by Hamas and Israel's retaliatory assault, students have launched rallies, sit-ins, fasts and, most recently, encampments against the war. According to a BBC tally, there have been pro-Palestine protests at 45 states and Washington DC since the demonstrations started at Columbia University in New York on 17 April. They are demanding that their schools, many with massive endowments, financially divest from Israel.  Many also want their universities to end academic relationships with Israeli institutions. Previously, President Joe Biden said people had the right to protest but not the right to cause chaos. But, Mr Biden warned on Tuesday the threat of antisemitism is growing in the US, including on college campuses, joining a heated American debate about Jewish security, Zionism, free speech and support for Israel, in the country with the largest Jewish population after Israel. Addressing a bipartisan audience at the US Holocaust Memorial Museum's annual commemoration, Mr Biden said: ""This hatred (of Jews) continues to lie deep in the hearts of too many people in the world and requires our continued vigilance and outspokenness,"" Biden said. ""Now here we are, not 75 years later, but just seven and a half months later, and people are already forgetting ... that Hamas unleashed this terror,"" he added.  ""I have not forgotten, nor have you. And we will not forget."""
Volatility,Migrants hit by high fees to send money home,2024-09-25,2024-04-29,By Christine Ro,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68817110,"Jerry Lukendo Mbokani has to make several calculations when he sends money to his elderly mother in the Democratic Republic of Congo. In Kampala, Uganda, where Mr Mbokani has lived for 16 years, he first has to buy US dollars. To convert approximately $100 (£80) worth of Ugandan shillings would cost almost $3, he reports. He also adds the withdrawal fee of $7, so that his mother doesn't incur a fee when receiving the money. He sends these remittances through mobile money, usually phone-based digital transfers, rather than through a physical location like a bank, post office, or Western Union-style money transfer company. In real terms 10% of the amount could be eaten up in fees. Mr Mbokani, the chief executive of the Refugee-Led Organization Network (Relon), knows he's far from alone. One target of the UN Sustainable Development Goals is that by 2030, remittance fees should be less than 3%, and total fees to send and receive money between a pair of countries should be no more than 5%. Some researchers believe that to be truly affordable, the first goal should be even less than 3%. The International Monetary Fund has estimated that reaching this target could generate $32bn (£26bn), even apart from the direct-cost savings. This is because remittances have such powerful knock-on effects for the economy, and people tend to send more in remittances when fees are lower. Yet the world is far off this target. According to the World Bank, the global average is 6.2%, over double the target. It's especially pricey to send money to sub-Saharan Africa, where the average transaction fee is 7.4%. For particular combinations of countries, fee percentages can climb well into the double digits. One reason for high fees is inconsistent regulation. Within Africa a payment company can't use a single licence across multiple countries, says Nika Naghavi. She is the group head of growth at Onafriq, a digital payment network that extends through more than 40 African countries.  A result is that even between neighbouring countries with a robust trade and frequent population movement, money can't always flow freely. For instance, Ms Naghavi says, transfers between Togo and Benin are frequent and straightforward, helped by having a common currency. Yet money can't easily be sent between Togo and another neighbour country, Ghana. ""That's why the costs become heavy: a lot of it is in compliance and regulation,"" says Ms Naghavi. More technology of business These requirements may not be so applicable to low-value transfers. Sending $50 to a relative in another country is not very risky, but may still fall under a complicated chain of regulations meant to safeguard against money laundering. In some countries, ""the regulations governing who can act as a remittance provider can be quite stifling,"" says Ravenna Sohst, a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute Europe. ""For young companies to enter into this market requires a lot of technical, financial and legal knowhow, which I think is one of the reasons why the field has seen relatively few players for a long time."" Ms Sohst says that Mexico-US is an example of a major remittance corridor, where more competition has helped reduce prices. Without competition, rates can be set by the few companies (or informal, cash-based agents) able to facilitate transfers between a pair of countries. Limited competition also means that companies may not feel the need to disclose much information about fees. ""It's up to sometimes the service providers what they want to show to the customer,"" says Uloma Ogba, a gender and learning specialist for the Migration and Remittances Program of the UN Capital Development Fund (UNCDF).  This can include misleading claims about zero-fee transactions, which ""often means that the service provider and other agents involved along that transaction process are making money some other way"". ""Our North Star should be to ensure that these customer fees are as close as possible to zero,"" Ms Naghavi says. ""But today it's not possible because of the underlying cost of running your business."" Companies may temporarily lower or eliminate transaction fees during disasters, as occurred immediately after the 2023 earthquake in Morocco. But emergency expenses crop up at other times as well. Female migrants, especially, are sending money home to cover unseen expenses. In Ms Ogba's own monthly remittances from the US to Nigeria, she prioritises her parents' healthcare, her cousin's education, and communal obligations like funeral expenses. On top of this are contributions for home renovations. Flexible pricing structures would be particularly helpful for women. They typically earn lower incomes than men and often send smaller, more frequent remittances for things like healthcare and education, Ms Ogba says. Because digital remittances are more affordable than traditional banking (with average fees of 4.8% vs. 6.2% respectively), and because they can require less documentation, much of the innovation is occurring in the digital realm. For instance, a fintech company catering to Gambian migrants in the UK found that its customers wanted to be able to directly pay utility bills for their families in Gambia. It's impossible to talk about digital innovation in sending money without mentioning cryptocurrency. Some enthusiasts believe that Bitcoin and other types of crypto promise more seamless transfers of money anywhere in the world. However, volatility, patchy regulation and limited knowledge remain barriers to uptake of cryptocurrency for remittances. Even more basic technologies can be out of reach for people sending and receiving remittances. While it's cheaper to send mobile money, many of the poorest people in the world lack mobile phones and internet access. While at least half of remittances are now digital, cash remittances dominate in low-and middle-income countries.  It can also be especially difficult for people on the move, or those unable to obtain official forms of identification, to provide tax ID numbers and other documentation. In Uganda, Mr Mbokani says, refugee ID cards aren't part of the same centralised register as national IDs. And there can be obstacles to using refugee IDs at some money transfer agencies. Such issues mean that ""we're leaving a lot of people behind,"" Ms Naghavi comments. "
Volatility,"Deadly attacks in Reading avoidable, inquest finds",2024-09-25,2024-04-26,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-berkshire-68896078,"The deaths of three men murdered by a man convicted under anti-terror laws in a Reading park were avoidable, an inquest has concluded.  Khairi Saadallah killed James Furlong, David Wails, and Joe Ritchie-Bennett, in Forbury Gardens in June 2020. He was given a whole-life term in 2021 after admitting murder and the attempted murder of three other men. Judge Coroner Sir Adrian Fulford found major problems with intelligence sharing between authorities. Addressing the court, he described Saadallah's ""volatility"" and said he had a ""terrorist mindset"".  Counter Terrorism Policing, the Probation Service and Berkshire NHS Foundation Trust were among the organisations criticised for failing in the case.  Speaking outside the Old Bailey, James Furlong's father Gary said: ""Our boys didn't stand a chance."" ""It is clear that there was failure after failure by all state agencies who dealt with Saadallah,"" he said. Saadallah arrived in the UK in 2012 as a teenage refugee, having fought in the Libyan revolution, and suffered from PTSD, among other conditions. He had extensive contact with mental health services, but Sir Adrian said Saadallah was ""caught in a catch-22"" with no continuity of care. He concluded it was ""at least possible"" Saadallah would never have attacked the men if his mental health had been correctly managed by authorities.  Sir Adrian also said if intelligence about the high risk he posed had been shared properly he might have been detained by police. He also found ""significantly troubling failings"" by counter-terrorist police officers, who lacked understanding and did not share information with other forces and the probation service.  Counter-terror programmes, such as Prevent, did not provide any ""effective intervention"" to address Saadallah's threats. Reports about the risk he posed were ""markedly deficient"", the judge coroner said, and one intelligence assessment was ""simply inadequate"". Sir Adrian said Saadallah had ""demonstrated capacity for violence"" on many occasions, and his behaviour had ""markedly deteriorated"" in the 18 months before the attack. He should have been recognised as a high-risk patient, he added. Saadallah was released from prison on 5 June 2020 and went to live in a flat in Basingstoke Road in Reading before he started preparing the attack. He visited Forbury Gardens, researched it online and bought a knife in a Morrisons supermarket.  The night before the murders, local officers visited Saadallah after his brother rang police to raise concerns about his mental state. Body-worn video from the two-minute encounter shows Saadallah reassuring the officers, who asked how he was feeling and if he had enough food. A carrier bag containing a knife was visible on the floor behind him. On 20 June, his attack was ""ruthless and lethal"", prosecutors at his murder trial said. He attacked his victims so quickly that those who died had no idea what was happening.  He shouted ""Allahu Akbar [God is greatest]"" as he attacked, and again as he ran away into Reading town centre, where he was chased and arrested by unarmed police. When he was sentenced in January 2021, Judge Mr Justice Sweeney said Saadallah carried out a ""ruthless and brutal"" attack.  He said the three men ""had no chance to react, let alone defend themselves"".  The judge added he was sure the attack ""involved a substantial degree of premeditation or planning"" and was carried out ""for the purpose of advancing a political, religious, or ideological cause"". Speaking outside court, Dr David Wails' brother Andrew said: ""The failings of the state exposed by this inquest sicken and disgust me, those who failed in their duties are responsible for David, James and Joe's deaths. ""I will never forgive and never forget the pain and suffering inflicted on David and my family, which we have to endure for the rest of our lives."" A spokesperson for Berkshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust said there had been ""significant learnings"" in the trust since the Forbury Gardens attack.  They said changes were ""focussed on much better communication and engagement with our partners and the way in which multi-agency working is delivered."" ""We will now review the coroner's findings and work alongside all agencies involved, to ensure any further learning and improvements can be agreed and embedded as quickly as possible,"" they added. Speaking on behalf of Counter Terrorism Policing South East and Thames Valley Police, Assistant Chief Constable Tim Metcalfe said they acknowledged the inquest's conclusion. He said: ""We in policing have not waited until this point to make changes where needed. ""Much has already been done to address these issues, but let me be clear, I know that there is still work to do."" He said police had an ""unrelenting"" commitment to learn, change and improve ""where required"". Follow BBC South on Facebook, X, or Instagram.

Volatility,Oil price eases as Iran downplays attack,2024-09-25,2024-04-19,Mariko Oi,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2vwl91qe6do,"Oil and gold prices have eased after Iranian authorities appeared to downplay reports of an attack from Israel. Brent crude, the international benchmark, fell after jumping briefly to over $90 a barrel after reports emerged of an attack. Gold briefly came close to a record high before settling below $2,400 an ounce. There are concerns a worsening conflict in the Middle East could disrupt oil supplies. Investors have been closely watching Israel’s reaction to Iran's direct drone and missile attack last weekend. Oil prices had jumped by as much as 3.5% initially. But Brent then fell back to roughly $87 a barrel after Iranian state media claimed that there was ""no damage"" in Isfahan province where there had been reports of explosions.  Sharp and sustained rises in oil prices risk fuelling inflation. Countries are heavily reliant on the commodity, which is used to produce fuels such as petrol and diesel. Fuel and energy prices have been a major driver behind the higher cost of living worldwide in the past couple of years. Randeep Somel, fund manager at M&G Investment Management, told the BBC's Today programme: ""The concern for markets would mainly be the inflationary one, that this would actually add to inflation."" While the pace of inflation has been slowing, in the UK it is still above the Bank of England's 2% target and some economists have forecast that a cut to interest rates may not happen until summer or later on in the year.   ""In the UK, the inflation rates is still around 3.2% - still someway off the target – and it is becoming a bit of a concern for policy makers,"" said Mr Somel. ""It is good to see that this hasn’t escalated any further and that hopefully the disruption to markets is short-lived.” The price of Brent is far below the heights reached after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022 when a number of major economies imposed sanctions on the oil-producing nation. Oil hit $125 a barrel in the weeks that followed, leading to a sustained period of higher household energy bills. The gold price often rises at times of uncertainty as it is seen as a safe investment. The heightened tension in the Middle East has led to concerns about whether shipping through the Strait of Hormuz between Oman and Iran will be affected. It is a crucial shipping route, as about 20% of the world's total oil supply passes through it. Members of the oil producers' cartel Opec - Saudi Arabia, Iran, the UAE, Kuwait and Iraq - send most of the oil they export through the strait. Iran is the seventh largest oil producer in the world, according to the US Energy Information Administration, and the third-largest member of Opec. The initial spike in oil prices was ""a knee-jerk reaction to fears of a renewed escalation of warfare between Israel and Iran,"" said energy market expert Vandana Hari of Vanda Insights. ""What the latest events underscore is the heightened fragility and volatility in the Mid East situation,"" she added. Stock markets were mixed as investors reacted to the latest events.  In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was roughly 0.5% higher in mid-day trade, while the S&P 500 fell 0.5% and the Nasdaq was down 1.3%. In the UK, the FTSE 100 share index closed 0.2% higher while the FTSE 250 ended down 0.3%. In Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 index fell 2.7%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 0.9%.  "
Volatility,Weir Group exits oil and gas in £314m deal,2024-09-25,2020-10-05,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-54416033,"Weir Group has announced it is selling its oil and gas division to Caterpillar in a £314m deal. The division employs more than 2,000 people, most of them in North America. It was loss-making in the first half of this year. Weir has pursued a strategy of leaving the power and oil and gas markets. It has concentrated efforts on mining, which generate revenues of over £2bn annually. The business processes the majority of the world's mined copper. This is a key component in smart phones, solar panels, wind turbines and electric vehicles. The deal with Caterpillar is subject to approval from both Weir shareholders and regulators but is expected to complete by the end of the year. A venerable name in Scottish engineering, Weir's move out of oil and gas is another clear signal of a transition in the energy sector. It's far from being alone. BP and Shell are following Norway's Equinor into rapid diversification away from a dependence on fossil fuels. The Aberdeen-based giant, Wood (formerly with the word 'group' attached), used to be described as an oil services company. Not any more. That's quickly become the lesser share of its operations. It's pushing into renewables engineering, with a recent deal signed to scope out the prospects for a hydrogen pipeline network down Scotland's eastern seaboard. Shareholders do not much appreciate the volatility of the oil and gas sector over the past six years, and particularly in North American fracking, where boom and bust swings wildly on the oil price. Weir has been one of the major suppliers of heavy-duty equipment to drillers there. Company bosses also see the reputational risk of close association with climate change. All these companies are emphasising their newer focus on sustainability and renewable energy.  Even if mineral and metal mining, where Weir is now focussed, remains a dirty and energy-hungry business, it's being presented as essential to providing materials for the new economy. Weir Group chief executive officer Jon Stanton described the deal as ""a major milestone"". He said: ""It means Weir is ideally positioned to benefit from long-term structural demographic trends and climate change actions which will increase demand for essential metals that must also be produced more sustainably and efficiently.   ""This will require the innovative engineering and close customer partnerships that define Weir, and it is why we are so excited about the future."" Joe Creed, vice president of Caterpillar's oil and gas and marine division, said the move ""will expand our offerings to one of the broadest product lines in the well service industry""."
Volatility,El Salvador makes Bitcoin legal tender,2024-09-25,2021-06-09,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-57398274,"El Salvador has become the first country in the world to officially classify Bitcoin as legal currency. Congress approved President Nayib Bukele's proposal to embrace the cryptocurrency, with 62 out of 84 possible votes on Tuesday night. The president said the government had made history, and that the move would make it easier for Salvadoreans living abroad to send money home. Bitcoin will become legal tender, alongside the US dollar, in 90 days. The new law means every business must accept Bitcoin as legal tender for goods or services, unless it is unable to provide the technology needed to do the transaction. ""It will bring financial inclusion, investment, tourism, innovation and economic development for our country,"" President Bukele said in a tweet shortly before the vote. He has previously said the move will open up financial services to the 70% of Salvadoreans who do not have bank accounts. El Salvador's economy relies heavily on remittances, or money sent home from abroad, which make up around 20% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP). More than two million Salvadoreans live outside the country, but they continue to keep close ties to their place of birth, sending back more than $4bn (£2.8bn) each year. On Twitter, some financial and legal observers described the law change as a remarkable accomplishment and a game changer, while others raised concerns about the cryptocurrency's volatility. Experts have warned it could also complicate matters with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), where El Salvador is seeking a more than $1 billion programme. The Congress vote happened on the same day that former US President Donald Trump said he saw Bitcoin as a ""scam"". ""I don't like it because it's another currency competing against the dollar,"" he told Fox Business.  He added that he wanted the dollar to be ""the currency of the world"". Bitcoin, a virtual asset with no direct connection to the real economy, has seen large fluctuations in value over the years.   Most of the world's central banks are looking into the possibility of creating their own digital currencies. In April, the Bank of England announced it was looking into creating a digital money that would exist alongside cash and bank deposits."
Volatility,Japanese yen touches 32-year low against US dollar,2024-09-25,2022-10-14,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63252034,"The Japanese yen touched a 32-year low against the US dollar after official figures showed that prices had risen faster than expected in America. The yen fell to 147.66 against the US dollar before regaining some ground. Japanese Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki said the government will take ""appropriate action"" against the currency's volatility. In a rare move last month, Japan spent almost $20bn (£17.6bn) to prop up the country's struggling currency. ""We cannot tolerate excessive volatility in the currency market driven by speculative moves. We're watching currency moves with a strong sense of urgency,"" Mr Suzuki told reporters after attending a G7 finance meeting in Washington, DC. Last month, Japan intervened in the global currency market to help support the weakening yen. That move came after the yen hit a fresh 24-year low against the dollar, marking the first time that Japanese authorities had intervened in the currency market since 1998. However, analysts have warned that interventions like this would have little effect as long as Japan's interest rates remain far lower than those in the US. The Japanese currency has come under increasing pressure in recent months, mainly due to the very different approach taken by the Bank of Japan (BOJ) in comparison with the US Federal Reserve. On Thursday, official figures showed that consumer prices in the US rose more than expected last month in a sign that the inflation fight in the world's largest economy is far from over. Inflation, the rate at which prices rise, was 8.2% in the 12 months to September, down from 8.3% in August. Rising consumer prices in the US are being closely watched as the Federal Reserve's efforts to cool inflation push up the value of the dollar as well as global borrowing costs. America's central bank has been aggressively raising its interest rates to combat soaring prices, which has made the dollar more attractive to investors. In contrast, the BOJ kept rates very low. The dollar's strength on the global financial markets is also having an impact on other major currencies around the world, including the pound and the euro."
Volatility,Risk of £50bn bond sale sparked emergency Bank move,2024-09-25,2022-10-06,By Faisal Islam,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63161404,"The aftermath of the mini-budget could have seen a £50bn fire sale of UK government bonds by funds connected to the pensions industry, the Bank of England has said. There was risk of a downward ""spiral"", it said, as increases in the cost of government borrowing hit the funds. The Bank feared these funds would be forced to sell their government debt holdings, adding to the market turmoil. The cost of borrowing saw record increases for two days, the Bank said. The rise in borrowing costs over four days was ""three times larger than any other historical move"". The Bank stepped in to calm markets last week following fears that some types of pension funds were at risk of collapse.  It pledged to buy up to £65bn of government bonds after the mini-budget sparked turmoil on financial markets and the pound plunged. Investors had demanded a much higher return for investing in government bonds, causing some to halve in value. The Bank said that the market in long-term loans to the government lasting three decades, known as 30-year gilts, saw two days where the effective cost of borrowing saw record increases, on its data which starts in 2000.  A letter from the Bank's deputy governor John Cunliffe to the Treasury Select Committee contains a diagram depicting the trigger for the interest rate shock as the ""fiscal event"", another name for the mini-budget, and that the nature of the move in the UK was not seen in the US or eurozone. Jonathan Haskell, a member of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee, also said in a speech on Thursday that ""there was undoubtedly a UK-specific factor"" in the market turmoil. This contradicts the claims made by some government supporters that the mini-budget had nothing to do with last week's turmoil, which was instead caused by ""global factors"". The UK's independent economic forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), had offered to prepare a draft forecast in time for the mini-budget, but the government did not take this up. Mr Haskell added that the Bank uses OBR data in its own forecasts, and a ""sidelined"" OBR ""generates more uncertainty by worsening everyone's information base"". The risk the Bank feared was that the funds connected to the pensions industry, known as Liability Driven Investments, would become forced sellers of their holdings of UK government debt, in an already troubled market. A £50bn sale would represent four times the normal daily trade in the market, and would have pushed the effective cost of borrowing, or yield, even higher than 5%, leading to further problems. Before the mini-budget, this yield had stood at about 3.7%. While individual defined benefit pension funds were not at risk, because they are guaranteed by the sponsoring company, it could have led to a wider financial stability challenge. The Bank of England decided to intervene in the market last Wednesday, bringing down the effective borrowing cost from over 5% to under 4%. As the Bank has eased off its interventions, on Thursday these costs had risen notably again, as high as 4.4%. These rates feed into the costs of long-term mortgages and business lending. The Bank emergency intervention is due to end next week and it has so far bought a fraction of the government bonds it could have, spending just £3.7bn. On Thursday, the Bank said it would wind down its bond buying in ""a smooth and orderly fashion"" once it felt the market was functioning normally again. The Bank also said it is working with the UK's pensions and financial regulators to make sure that that investment strategies used by certain types of pension schemes can withstand market volatility."

Robert Chaplin, who was 49, is thought to have had a cardiac arrest due to the stress of the punch and pre-existing cardiac disease. Mr Chaplin and the resident who punched him were both staying at the Morewood Centre in Alfreton, Derbyshire. The inquest heard they got into a disagreement and Mr Chaplin confronted the other resident with raised fists. The other resident, referred to as Witness A, was initially arrested by police on suspicion of murder but was not charged. The coroner, Peter Nieto, said there was evidence Witness A acted in self-defence and had punched Mr Chaplin ""out of fear for his own safety"". ""Robert died due to unsurvivable hypoxic brain injury following prolonged cardiac arrest caused by being punched,"" said Mr Nieto at the inquest in Chesterfield. Mr Chaplin's cause of death was recorded as hypoxic brain injury, the consequences of an altercation and cardiac disease.  The inquest heard Mr Chaplin and Witness A both had learning difficulties and mental health needs. Mr Chaplin had bipolar disorder, autistic spectrum disorder, some physical health problems including scoliosis and diabetes, and had issues with alcohol use. The coroner said there had been some ""volatility"" between the two men on 23 January 2020. Mr Chaplin asked staff for £30 and said he was going to the pub, Mr Nieto said, and when he returned it was ""clear he had drank alcohol"". Mr Chaplin made aggressive comments and confronted Witness A with raised fists, the coroner said. ""The other resident punched Robert in the neck, which caused Robert to fall back onto the floor,"" said the coroner. ""A member of staff had entered the room and tried to separate them and diffuse the situation."" The coroner said Witness A's understanding of the consequences of his actions was ""questionable"" due to his own complex needs. Mr Chaplin was taken to the Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham, where he died on 24 January 2020. The coroner said conclusions of unlawful killing or accident would not be appropriate, and instead gave a narrative conclusion which summarised what had happened.

Egdon Resource said extending permissions near North Kelsey could provide valuable UK-based oil reserves. Residents against the proposals said ""horrors"" in Ukraine had been ""seized upon by Egdon to justify this project"". The company's application to allow more time for oil exploration at the site was refused by the council.  Egdon, which has had permission to explore in the area since 2014, was seeking the right to continue for another 12 months. But campaigners argued the amount of oil from the land would be ""trivial"" and said the site was home to rare wildlife species, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.  Egdon managing director Mark Abbot told Lincolnshire County Council's planning and regulation committee that Russia's invasion of Ukraine had brought into focus significant rises in oil prices and volatility in pricing. ""It's essential that there is sufficient supply of minerals to provide the infrastructure and buildings energy and goods that the country needs,"" he said.  ""Great weight should be given to these benefits… It's clear that there remains a national need for onshore oil and gas as part of the diverse and secure energy supply."" He blamed Covid for delaying work and said it impacted on plant operations in North Kelsey. He said re-evaluations carried out in that time had identified a better location 70-100 metres north which had the potential for greater amounts of oil. However, Amanda Suddaby, representing residents, told the meeting they had endured years of anxiety over the plans.  She said figures showed the plans ""might produce 50 to 200 barrels a day"" and argued 15 years' output would ""produce enough oil to supply the UK for just a few hours, not even a day"". Backing campaigners, Louth Wolds ward councillor Hugo Marfleet, said: ""This is not going to influence and be a game changer for anything about oil supply.  ""If they want proper oil go to the North Sea, but this is a little pond that's actually has no water left in it."" Rejecting the plans, councillors said they were unconvinced by the company's arguments with councillor Thomas Smith saying that using the Ukraine conflict as justification was ""disingenuous"".

The Telegraph has accompanied deaf children evacuated from a school in southern Ukraine. Using sign language, one teenager tells the paper that while he cannot hear the shelling, he feels ""the house shaking, everything shaking"" and a ""shock that judders through the bones"". The Financial Times reports Ukraine and the West have ""poured scorn"" on Moscow's offer of safe routes out of besieged cities - after it became clear those routes were to Russia or Belarus. The paper says the concept now leads to ""more fear and terrifying dead ends"" for civilians. The Daily Mail writes that President Vladimir Putin is ""panicking"" because of the failure of his military operation, adding the Russian leader is now seeking a negotiated settlement. The Guardian reports from Odesa on Ukraine's Black Sea coast, where preparations are under way to fight off any Russian assault.  It says nobody there can believe Mr Putin could attack a city with ""almost mythical resonance"" for many Russians, but adds the Russian armed forces have done lots of things in recent days that seemed unthinkable just two weeks ago.

Volatility,Stripe to ditch Bitcoin payment support,2024-09-25,2018-01-24,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42798935,"Stripe, the firm which helps more than 100,000 businesses do financial transactions online, is to scrap support for Bitcoin payments. It said Bitcoin users now saw the virtual currency largely as an ""asset"" to be traded, rather than something to make payments with. Fewer online merchants wanted to accept the cryptocurrency, it added.  Rising fees and longer transaction times as a result of price fluctuations also lessened its appeal, Stripe said. Customers of the US-based payments firm pay a fee to Stripe each time it processes a payment. Clients include Lyft, Deliveroo, Grab and Target. In 2014, it became the first major payments company to support Bitcoin payments. At the time Stripe said it hoped Bitcoin would become a way for people in places with low credit card penetration or prohibitively high credit card fees to do transactions online. But the virtual currency was now ""better-suited to being an asset than being a means of exchange,"" it said.  There has been a huge surge of interest in the digital currency over the past year or so, driven largely by its rapid increase in price. But that demand has also led to huge swings in price, with Stripe saying the volatility meant the time needed to complete a sale had risen. ""By the time the transaction is confirmed, fluctuations in Bitcoin price mean that it's for the 'wrong' amount,"" Stripe's product manager Tom Karlo said in his blog. Bitcoin transaction fees had also risen ""a great deal"" resulting in a decrease in demand from Stripe's customers to accept Bitcoin payments, he said. ""For a regular Bitcoin transaction, a fee of tens of US dollars is common, making Bitcoin transactions about as expensive as bank wires,"" Mr Karlo wrote.  ""Because of this, we've seen the desire from our customers to accept Bitcoin decrease. And of the businesses that are accepting Bitcoin on Stripe, we've seen their revenues from Bitcoin decline substantially."" Stripe said it would start winding down its support for Bitcoin immediately and would stop all transactions by 23 April. But it said its decision to end support for Bitcoin payments did not mean it was giving up on cryptocurrencies all together.  ""We're interested in what's happening with Lightning and other proposals to enable faster payments,"" Mr Karlo said. ""OmiseGO is an ambitious and clever proposal; more broadly, Ethereum continues to spawn many high-potential projects."""
Volatility,Crypto.com pulls out of Champions League deal,2024-09-25,2022-09-02,By Shiona McCallum,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-62764654,"Crypto.com has pulled out of a sponsorship deal with Uefa for the Champions League, the BBC understands. The agreement, worth £428m over five seasons, is said to have fallen through at the ""last moment"", amid concerns about increased crypto regulation. The cryptocurrency exchange site was set to replace Gazprom after Uefa severed links with the Russian energy provider over the war in Ukraine. The concerns are thought to relate to potential legal trading restrictions.  Over the past few years digital assets have moved from the fringes of the economy and have entered the mainstream, with more and more football sponsorship deals being confirmed. Both Chelsea and Atletico Madrid signed an agreement with trading platform WhaleFin and Manchester City have OKX as their training kit partner.  Watford have previously had Bitcoin as a club sponsor and accepted the cryptocurrency at the club.  Last year, Spanish striker David Barral made football history when his move from Real Madrid to DUX International de Madrid was paid for using Bitcoin.  According to Uefa, the cryptocurrency sector has partly helped clubs to fill the revenue streams that were lost as a result of the pandemic. But critics say there are concerns about the volatility of the crypto market - particularly that the plummeting price of tokens can expose fans to potential debts. Despite these lucrative sponsorship deals, Bitcoin is down almost 70% from its historic November 2021 high, Ethereum is down more than 70%, and several crypto exchanges have laid off workers en masse. In June, Crypto.com cut almost 5% of its workforce - about 260 employees - according to chief executive Kris Marszalek. Crypto.com is the fastest-growing crypto platform with more than 10 million users around the world.  The site, which has global headquarters in Singapore, also has sponsorship deals with Formula 1, the Ice Hockey World Championship and the 2022 Fifa World Cup in Qatar. It also has many major sponsorship deals in American sports, topping off its marketing efforts earlier this year with an advert featuring basketball legend LeBron James that aired during TV coverage of the Super Bowl. The collapse of the Champions League deal with Crypto.com, first reported by SportBusiness, is said to have been because of fears that regulatory concerns in European countries could create legal problems for the company's ability to trade and operate. Haider Rafique, global marketing chief at OKX, the second-largest global crypto exchange, told the BBC: ""The European regulatory landscape as it applies to the crypto space is nuanced and still evolving.  ""The changing regimes focus on regulatory concepts, like consumer protection and anti-money laundering, that are generally welcomed by the industry.

Volatility,What's it like to work for a political leader in your twenties?,2024-09-25,2017-12-13,By Gavin Stamp,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-42242000,"""I found the whole thing completely overwhelming when I first started."" Kate Shouesmith is admirably candid about what it was like to find herself working in Downing Street aged just 22. Helping answer David Cameron's correspondence and organising receptions for MPs at Downing Street were among her day-to-day tasks when she first moved to No 10 from Conservative Central Office in late 2010. While often the youngest person in the room, she was struck by the number of other 20-somethings among the circle of people working for the prime minister in the early days of his premiership. ""There was a core group of 25 to 35-year-olds,"" she says, many of whom, like her, had been inspired to get involved by the Tory leader's modernisation of the party and his success in the 2010 election. While Westminster is often caricatured as a place out of touch with the lives of young people and indifferent to their concerns, there are quite a few people who have worked not just in the corridors of power but very close to the centre of power at a strikingly young age. And they are not just career politicians like Mr Cameron, who famously worked as a special adviser to Chancellor Norman Lamont in his early 20s. Matt Zarb-Cousin was plucked from relative obscurity at the age of 27 to become Jeremy Corbyn's spokesman in the Spring of 2016. Before starting the job he was warned that nothing could prepare him for the challenge ahead, one of his colleagues likening it to ""learning to ski jump"". The advice was sound. The party soon became embroiled in a virtual civil war, with half the shadow cabinet resigning in the space of a few days in protest at Jeremy Corbyn's performance during the Brexit referendum. ""They would resign, go on broadcast and then brief a negative story about the leadership,"" he recalls. ""For the first few months it was a baptism of fire, trying to hold my finger in the dam. ""At 27, I was fielding between 80 and 100 calls and texts a day from every press and broadcast journalist in the country for the leader of the opposition... ""Nothing can prepare you for it but the experience prepares you for anything."" Learning on the job is not unusual but doing it in the pressure cooker of Westminster politics, particularly one characterised during the EU referendum by its extreme volatility and partisanship, is another altogether. Michael Heaver was also 27 when he became Nigel Farage's spokesman in 2016. Although he was already a member of the UKIP leader's inner circle, he admits he was ""really young to get the job"".   ""In any walk of life, if you are young then there are going to be people who complain,"" he says. ""My attitude has always been rather than bitch and complain, get on with it. ""You have to be confident and assertive and pick up things along the way. Nigel would not have given me the job if he did not think I was up to it."" Although the UKIP leader was an experienced hand with the media and was rarely off TV screens during the referendum campaign, even Michael Heaver was surprised at the sheer demands on his time. ""Nigel Farage is such a machine,"" he says with admiration. ""What was very important was filtering out what he should and shouldn't do, because there was too much to do."" Kate Shouesmith experienced the high and lows of politics during her five years working in Downing Street - in which she held a variety of roles including as a member of the operations team under chief of staff Ed Llewellyn and as special adviser to Samantha Cameron. One of the highs was being part of a small group who criss-crossed the UK plotting David Cameron's itinerary for the 2015 election campaign, a ""completely unglamorous but very exciting"" experience. ""We spent two months travelling the country in a Volkswagen Charan, spending the nights in Premier Inns, setting up visits for the prime minister, chancellor and Samantha Cameron in factories, schools and everywhere in between."" Although she wasn't with the PM when that famous exit poll showing a Tory majority dropped - she was having dinner with her husband-to-be as ""I had not seen him for three months"" - she recalls the mixture of nervousness and excitement inside No 10 as if it was only yesterday. Fast forward about a year and her emotions could not have been more different as it dawned on her and her colleagues that the UK had voted for Brexit. ""That was a really devastating night,"" she says. ""I walked back from the count to No 10 at four in the morning.  ""There were a group of us who were told by Ed Llewellyn that David Cameron was writing his resignation speech in his office. Standing in the street watching him deliver it, with everyone I had worked so closely with over five years, was terrible."" She had worked for the Britain Stronger in Europe campaign and her family were committed Remain supporters: ""It was not just a professional failure. It felt like a very personal one as well."" Within a couple of months she and most of her colleagues were given only a couple of hours to clear their things out of No 10 when Theresa May succeeded David Cameron as PM.  While the maxim ""if you're good enough, you're young enough"" certainly applies in politics - witness the growing number of MPs in their 20s - it is also perhaps still the case that younger advisers have to work perhaps that little bit harder to gain the respect of their colleagues. ""It was a steep learning curve,"" says Matt Zarb-Cousin, who was by Mr Corbyn's side for about a year before leaving to work for the Campaign For Fairer Gambling.  ""I used to get to Friday and be absolutely exhausted."" But as time went by, he says he gained the trust of the lobby journalists and ""was better able to kill stories that were not true"". He remembers being contacted by a tabloid newspaper in November 2016 while on his way to a tennis tournament at the O2, asking about an unusual story suggesting the Labour leader had been dancing at the Cenotaph on Remembrance Sunday. ""I was able to rebut that, get the story taken down and then enjoy the tennis for a couple of hours before the next story came along."" Now working for the public relations company Weber Shandwick, Kate Shouesmith says her advice to those keen on a backstage career in politics is to be a team player and to ""believe in who you are working for"".  Her Downing Street years, she says, were a ""strange high-low mixture"", ranging from ""stuffing Christmas cards and arranging hi vis and hard hats for visits to showing Michelle Obama around Downing Street, and trying to manage cabinet ministers and business delegations on international trade trips"". ""You have to be willing to muck in with the lighter stuff to contribute to the more exciting work."" The highlight for Michael Heaver, who now works for the Westmonster website, was when the UK voted to leave the EU. Those re-watching the footage from that giddy night will see him standing beside his boss during his triumphant victory speech and punching the air with delight.  ""It was one of the most historic moments in modern British politics,"" he says. ""There I was in my 20s alongside someone who I grew up admiring, who was one of my heroes and who I had the privilege to work with and get to know. ""If my time in politics ended today, it is something I would look back on with pride and be able to tell the grandchildren about."""

Volatility,Oil's up: What does it mean?,2024-09-25,2018-04-24,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-43886953,"There's no magic price for oil at which investment is switched off or on, depending on the direction of travel. Investment depends on each project and its break-even point, and no two oil fields are the same - least of all those that require drilling offshore. But at $75 a barrel, and on an upward trend, this seems a milestone at which to catch some breath and ask a) what's going on with the market for Brent crude? And b) what are the implications? So first, what's going on? That's simple, perhaps deceptively so. It's about our old friends, supply and demand. The latter is rising with economic growth, notably in Asia, but around the world.  Growth is not as closely aligned to demand for oil as it once was. But in India, for instance, development means a big boost to industrial production, demand for electricity and transport. Symbolic of India's economic position, Saudi Arabia announced this month it is investing big in a refinery and petro-chemicals complex on a beach resort south of Mumbai. Ratnagiri will be one of the world's largest, processing 1.2 million barrels per day.  Saudi Aramco (state-owned while aiming to float) is taking a 50% stake in the £32bn ($44bn) project, while a consortium of state-owned energy firms in India own the other half. Supply is a more complex picture.  American stocks of oil influence the market, and the official numbers are expected to show they've fallen. That puts upward pressure on the price. More significant in the longer term, the Opec exporters' cartel, working with non-member Russia, has been holding back on production in order to pull the price up. Saudis are among those straining at the loss of market share, particularly to Americans.  The market gyrated a bit last week when the Saudi oil minister said the rising price didn't seem to be doing much harm to demand, so he reckoned out loud that oil at $80 to $100 might be a possible sustainable target zone.  The Saudi government has, remember, a war to fight. And hostilities with Yemen, partially as a proxy for Iran, are one of the reasons for markets being nervous about security of supply. The Straits of Hormuz are an oil supply choke point which could also be a flash point between Saudi and Iran. After the Saudi minister had hinted, Russia's energy minister counter-hinted that the constraints might come off the cartel, which would push the price down again. His comments did precisely that. America is the most dynamic part of the supply story, for two main reasons. Fracking technology extracts oil and gas for a limited period before new rock has to be fractured. It's a repeated process, and if, as in 2014-15, the price drops, the process is stopped. Only when the price rises again does fracking restart. That's what is happening. America is producing more oil now than ever. The other unpredictable dynamic sits in the Oval Office. Donald Trump wants to break from the Iran nuclear deal, which would involve a return to sanctions on Tehran's oil exports - that is, a cut in its supply into the world market.  The US president tweeted last Friday: ""Looks like OPEC is at it again. With record amounts of Oil all over the place, including the fully loaded ships at sea, Oil prices are artificially Very High! No good and will not be accepted!"" That, Mr President, is absolutely correct. Controlling supply and prices is precisely what cartels exist to do. That's the point of Opec.  And though oil prices may look too high from Washington DC, they probably don't look too high in mid-Texas or the Dakotas. ""No good"" for oil users, but very good for oil producers. And when you say this ""will not be accepted"", we look forward, nervously, to finding out if this is another threat of trade war. Put all that together, and the price of a barrel of oil delivered in three months has risen from a low below $30 at the start of 2016 to 150% more than that. However, the current price remains 43% below the peak in 2014. So what does it mean? Higher fuel prices? Well, not necessarily. At the same time the oil price, measured in US dollars, has been rising, the US dollar itself has been weakening against sterling. If like me, you'll find currencies easiest to understand by thinking of travelling abroad. If you want to vacation in America now, you'll be able to buy 12 more dollars for £100 than you could a year ago.  The same goes for dollar-denominated oil. A year ago, a pound bought you $1.28 on currency markets (without all those transaction charges). It now buys $1.40. That is, the pound buys 9% more in dollars than it did last year. The other factor is that UK forecourt prices have a lot to do with tax rates. VAT runs at 20%, so it is as volatile as the price. For heating fuel, VAT is 5%. Fuel duty for transport is fixed, currently sitting at 58p per litre. Take all that together, and the AA's price-monitoring tells us that the average price of a litre of unleaded fuel, at pumps across the UK, rose 1p between December and March, while diesel fell by 1p. For Scotland in particular, it's worth watching for three different effects. One is the risk of rising oil prices boosting costs for those who use fuel, in homes and in businesses. For those reasons around sterling, there's no sign of inflation resulting yet. But where economies are already doing well, analysts are concerned that the rising price of Brent crude could push up prices more widely. The other side of the coin in Scotland is the industry that extracts oil. Investment decisions have to take big gambles on the future price of Brent crude. In general, business plans don't like volatility or heightened uncertainty. It comes at a cost. They prefer to see a reasonably stable price and a market environment which looks like continuing that for the foreseeable. They don't have that yet, but they'll like the upward trend for more than two years. After a very harsh downturn, with the price slump from September 2014, much of the offshore industry has stabilised. It has a number of big final investment decisions - the gateway or green light for a project - which are helped by raised prices and an upward trend. Oil and Gas UK, the trade body, reckoned at the start of the year that at least 12 major investment projects were expected to be approved during 2018, worth around £5bn. So if there's more profit, there ought to be more tax revenue? Correct. But how much more?  Not as much as you would have found with other price revivals, because the UK Treasury has cut tax rates. The main tax take is at 30% of profits. The Supplementary Charge was cut in 2016 from 20% to 10%. And the Petroleum Revenue Tax rate, levied on profits from older fields, was cut from 35% to zero. The Office for Budget Responsibility last month raised its estimate of what the tax take might be as a result of the rising price, as it has had to do repeatedly.  It was a sharp increase, but to a level that remains low by previous standards - up from £500m this year to £900m.  Tax revenue from oil and gas is expected to average under £1bn annually for the five years of its forecast, which assumes the price of oil and of gas will fall again in the later three years. Production and profits are then expected to continue their decline. For the purposes of arguing the case for Scottish independence, a geographic share of that tax revenue is dwarfed by the scale of the public sector deficit calculated by Scottish government statisticians in their annual expenditure and revenue tables. Likewise, for those who want a national oil fund, less than a billion pounds per year might be nice to have but wouldn't go far.  That said, they are brave people who stick their necks out with assumptions about the oil price five years ahead. Sometimes, however, economic forecasters have nowhere to hide."
Volatility,US treasury secretary's wife rues missteps,2024-09-25,2018-02-14,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-43057577,"US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin's wife is trying to win over the American people after being dragged through the social media mud last year. In a new Elle magazine interview, Louise Linton regrets how she boasted about wealth and belittled a commenter on a now-deleted Instagram post. ""I wasn't thinking about who I am,"" Ms Linton is quoted as saying. ""I was so stupid. I wish I could take it back."" The Scottish-born actress and producer married Mr Mnuchin in June 2017. In the March issue, she explained: ""I wasn't thinking, I am the wife of this person and thus I should act like the wife of this person."" ""I felt like the kid on the playground that has been so bullied, and finally you punch back,"" Ms Linton said. The Instagram post in question showed Ms Linton exiting a US military plane after an official visit with her husband, after she had tagged the brand names of multiple fashion designers she was wearing. When a woman criticised her post, she launched into a paragraph-long reply, which has led her to being dubbed a modern-day Marie Antoinette by some US media outlets.   ""Have you given more to the economy than me or my husband?"" Ms Linton wrote, before calling the commenter  ""adorably out of touch"".  She apologised at the time, and deleted the offending post. Ms Linton, 37, spent part of her childhood living in a castle outside Edinburgh, and was interviewed by Elle at a New York diner, near the Upper Eastside apartment she and her husband own.  She told the journalist she is ""super-duper"" sorry for all of the missteps in her self-presentation. Ms Linton's other faux-pas include self-publishing, in 2016, a memoir of her experiences volunteering in Zambia during her gap year, which provoked a huge online backlash as reviews and comments accused her of being patronising, inaccurate and misleading. More recently, she was ridiculed for wearing elbow-length black leather gloves, while posing with her husband holding a sheet of money at the Bureau of Engraving and Printing.  She explained to Elle: ""I just didn't bother taking the gloves off because it was kind of cold in the bureau."" She said her husband showed her the social media reaction, including one post comparing her to Darth Vader.  She told Elle Magazine she has now consulted a Washington protocol expert. ""It's actually really a fascinating world. The world of political etiquette,"" she said. ""Obviously we both [referencing Mr Mnuchin] are ethical and good people, and we don't want to mess up.""  The expert has advised her on how to address ambassadors, greet Saudi sheiks and dress in Jerusalem, among other things.  ""I'm just a regular girl, and I'm not perfect, but I'm trying my best,"" she continued. ""Maybe I should wear that on a T-shirt and Instagram that. And then on the back it should say ...'I'm so sorry.'"""
Volatility,News Daily: Oxfam meeting and Grand Canyon crash,2024-09-25,2018-02-12,By Justin Parkinson,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-43023380,"Hello. Here's your morning briefing: Oxfam bosses will meet International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt later to discuss allegations the charity's staff used prostitutes in Haiti in 2011. Four people have been sacked since the claims emerged and three have resigned. Oxfam has denied any cover-up and it's announced new measures for the prevention and handling of sexual abuse cases. But Ms Mordaunt told the BBC the charity had failed in its ""moral leadership"" and that she was questioning whether government funding - worth £32m in the last financial year - should continue. US police have named three British tourists killed in a helicopter crash in Arizona's Grand Canyon. They were Becky Dobson, 27, Jason Hill, 32, and Stuart Hill, 30, officers said. Images show flames and thick smoke rising from the boulder-strewn site, but no cause has been given for the crash, in which three other Britons and the pilot were injured.

Volatility,MPs launch inquiry into digital currencies,2024-09-25,2018-02-22,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-43148180,"MPs have launched an inquiry into cryptocurrencies and the technology behind them. The Treasury Committee said it wants to understand the risks and benefits of digital money following an explosion of interest - and investment - in them. The MPs will cover the role of digital currencies in the UK, including the impact on consumers and businesses.  Although currencies such as Bitcoin have drawn criticism, the technology behind them has been praised.  Nicky Morgan, chair of the of the committee, said the MPs would look into how consumers and Britain's financial infrastructure might be better protected, without stifling innovation. Last year's rapid rise, and subsequent fall, in the value of Bitcoin focussed attention on cryptocurrencies. They were variously dismissed as fraudulent, a ""Ponzi"" investment scam, and a vehicle for criminals and tax evaders. Bank of England governor Mark Carney said Bitcoin had failed as a currency, but that the underlying technology which records and verifies the chain of transactions might prove useful. Warren Buffett, the venerated investor, said the speculative cryptocurrency craze ""will come to a bad end"". Venezuela launches oil cryptocurrency Tesla probes 'crypto-currency hack' Divorcing couples may clash over Bitcoin Ms Morgan said: ""People are becoming increasingly aware of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, but they may not be aware that they are currently unregulated in the UK, and that there is no protection for individual investors.  ""The Treasury Committee will look at the potential risks that digital currencies could generate for consumers, businesses, and governments, including those relating to volatility, money laundering, and cyber-crime. ""We will also examine the potential benefits of cryptocurrencies and the technology underpinning them, how they can create innovative opportunities, and to what extent they could disrupt the economy and replace traditional means of payment."" But she also wants to strike a balance between protection and regulation, and not hindering the blockchain technology behind cryptocurrencies. ""As part of the inquiry, we will explore how this can be achieved,"" she said. The committee, which has yet to set a date for its first evidence session, will take evidence on key questions, including:"
Volatility,"Bitcoin peaks at new high close to $20,000",2024-09-25,2020-12-01,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-55145444,"Bitcoin has traded at its highest value to date, reaching $19,920.53 (£14,821) according to data-provider Coindesk. It took the virtual currency nearly three years to top its previous record, when it peaked about $137 lower. Bitcoin has risen in value by more than 170% since the start of the year. Analysts suggest some investors have treated it as a ""safe haven asset"" at a time of uncertainty caused by the coronavirus pandemic, but others warn that it remains volatile. Bitcoin fell below $3,300 at one point after reaching its previous high. And even this Tuesday, it briefly dipped below $18,300 a couple of hours after setting its new record. Other factors that have supported its recent rise include PayPal allowing its platform to be used to buy and sell the virtual coins in October, and a number of large institutional investors declaring interest in buying into funds tied to the crypto-currency. These include Guggenheim Partners, a Wall Street firm that announced on Friday it might put as much as $530m into a Bitcoin-related investment trust. ""It seems that barely a day goes past when we don't read a headline about a mainstream fund or company expressing an intention to put some of their holdings into Bitcoin,"" said Rhian Lewis, author of The Cryptocurrency Revolution. ""Price predictions are notorious for being wrong, so it's entirely likely there will be more dips and volatility.  ""But this time it feels very different from the 2017 high - there seems to be more real demand, and the narrative is more measured."" She added that another factor was that investors are concerned that central bank efforts to deal with Covid-19 will fuel inflation. Gold and other precious metals are traditionally used to hedge against such a risk. But because in theory only a limited amount of Bitcoin can ever be created - it was designed to only let 21 million bitcoins be produced, of which about 18.6 million already exist - some favour it as an alternative. If it does climb higher there could be sudden drops in value, however, as some traders will have set automatic sell orders pegged to it reaching the $20,000 mark. One expert warned members of the public to be careful. ""Never invest money you can't afford to lose,"" said finance and economics writer Frances Coppola. ""Bitcoin is a speculative asset and has a history of sudden crashes. It's not worth risking your house or your life savings for it. ""And borrowing to invest in Bitcoin or other crypto-currencies is a bad idea unless you are a professional trader."" Bitcoin is often referred to as a new kind of currency. But it may be best to think of its units being virtual tokens rather than physical coins or notes. However, like all currencies its value is determined by how much people are willing to exchange it for. To process Bitcoin transactions, a procedure called ""mining"" must take place, which involves a computer solving a difficult mathematical problem with a 64-digit solution. For each problem solved, one block of Bitcoins is processed. In addition the miner is rewarded with new Bitcoins. This provides an incentive for people to provide computer processing power to solve the problems. To compensate for the growing power of computer chips, the difficulty of the puzzles is adjusted to ensure a steady stream of new Bitcoins are produced each day. To receive a Bitcoin, a user must have a Bitcoin address - a string of 27-34 letters and numbers - which acts as a kind of virtual post-box to and from which the Bitcoins are sent. Since there is no register of these addresses, people can use them to protect their anonymity when making a transaction. These addresses are in turn stored in Bitcoin wallets, which are used to manage savings. They operate like privately run bank accounts - with the proviso that if the data is lost, so are the Bitcoins owned."
Volatility,'Modi's Kashmir move will fuel resentment',2024-09-25,2019-08-05,By Andrew Whitehead,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-49233608,"For many Kashmiris, the special status afforded to Jammu and Kashmir by Article 370 of the Indian constitution reflects the different means by which, and basis on which, the princely state became part of India in late 1947. It was the result of an accommodation all those years ago between the government of India's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, and Kashmir's political leaders. India's BJP-led government has now unilaterally torn up that special dispensation. It's the biggest change in Kashmir's constitutional status since the 1950s. In practical terms, it doesn't mean all that much. The provisions of Article 370 have been greatly diluted over the decades. Jammu and Kashmir has its own constitution and its own flag, but otherwise no greater autonomy than any other Indian state.  A provision linked to Article 370 prevents outsiders buying property in the state. If that measure is also rescinded, as seems to be Delhi's intention, this may prompt fears of demographic change in the Kashmir valley - though there is unlikely to be much immediate impact.  It's the symbolic importance of the Indian government's move that matters most.  In repeated election manifestos, the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has pledged to scrap Kashmir's special status. It says full integration with the rest of India would promote development, and insists that there's no reason to treat Jammu and Kashmir differently either because it has a Muslim majority or because it is claimed by Pakistan. Narendra Modi's emphatic election victory in May has made it possible for the BJP to act on key Hindu nationalist demands such as the rescinding of Kashmir's special status. The move will be enthusiastically welcomed by the party's rank-and-file. But the measures taken in the run-up to the announcement demonstrate Delhi's concern about how the news will be received in Kashmir. Additional Indian troops were sent there, tourists and Hindu pilgrims were told to leave, schools and colleges were ordered to close, the internet and mobile networks were largely cut off, restrictions were placed on freedom of movement and assembly, and several mainstream Kashmiri politicians were placed under what amounts to house arrest.  Alongside the rescinding of special status, the Indian government has announced that Jammu and Kashmir will no longer be a state but have the lesser status of a union territory - and the sparsely populated region of Ladakh will be split off to become a separate union territory. That will attract a great deal of support in Jammu and in Ladakh but will be deeply resented in the Kashmir Valley. India's most restless and disaffected region may well become still more volatile. "
Volatility,Tech Tent: Has crypto-currency peaked?,2024-09-25,2018-09-14,By Rory Cellan-Jones,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-45526365,"If you believe crypto-currencies are the future this has not been a good week. The value of Ethereum, Bitcoin's main rival and ""the future of crypto"" not so long ago, has lurched ever lower and is now 80% below its peak.  Meanwhile, US regulators have acted against companies involved in crypto-currencies and initial coin offerings (ICOs) - schemes to create new coins. But hope springs eternal, and in recent days both a London art gallery and a Scottish hotel have contacted me about plans to allow their customers to pay with crypto-currencies.  So on this week's Tech Tent we debate this question: has crypto-currency peaked or do its best days lie ahead? We invited David Gerard, author of Attack of the 50 Foot Blockchain, a very sceptical take on the crypto landscape, to debate with Christopher Shake, the director of that London gallery, The House of Fine Art. The gallery's press release had boasted that it was about to run ""the very first art exhibition only available through crypto-currency"".  By the time Mr Shake arrived in our studio that had changed slightly - customers would be encouraged to buy the 500 works in the October exhibition in Bitcoin or a range of other digital currencies but if they wanted to use good old-fashioned dollars or pounds, such payment would be accepted. ""Our main goal is to support and promote our artists,"" he says. But as a crypto-currency enthusiast, he explains that there is also problem he wants to solve: people sitting on big crypto assets aren't able to spend them. ""If a lot of merchants do jump on and accept crypto-currencies, that will add confidence to the market,"" he explains. But David Gerard says things are moving in the opposite direction - fewer merchants are accepting crypto-currencies because they are so volatile and the promise of smooth cost-free transactions has proved illusory.  He says many left during the 2017 Bitcoin bubble. ""You couldn't trust it for volatility, you couldn't trust it because transactions were slow and often didn't go through at all. It really destroyed the use-case for the general merchant acceptance of cryptos."" He sums up his view of the whole crypto market: ""It's not really very interesting or shiny any more."" But Christopher Shake sees it very differently. He claims that everyone from Goldman Sachs to Amazon and Facebook is now moving into crypto-currencies - something David Gerard says just isn't the case - and he believes it is an idea whose time has come. ""It is sticking around because it has value. It's sticking around because it's a great technology, and that's why institutions are getting into it."" But for all his reservations, David Gerard does not expect Bitcoin in particular to disappear in a hurry.

Volatility,Crypto-currency company reports $31m raid,2024-09-25,2017-11-21,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-42065724,"The company behind the digital currency Tether has said that close to $31m (£23.4m) worth of its tokens have been stolen. The Hong Kong-based company said it had taken action to prevent the thieves from redeeming the funds but now required other users to install an update. It follows a series of other recent scandals involving crypto-currencies. Bitcoin fell on the news but soon recovered most of its lost ground. Unlike many digital currencies, which tend to fluctuate wildly against the dollar, Tether is pegged to the US currency. This is supposed to protect investors from the volatility that can affect Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple and Litecoin, while allowing them to take advantage of a Blockchain-based asset suitable for fund transfers. According to Tether's operator, $30,950,010 worth of tokens were removed from one of the company's core ""treasury wallets"" and sent to an unauthorised Bitcoin address on 19 November. ""A thorough investigation on the cause of the attack is being undertaken to prevent similar actions in the future,"" the company said in a statement published on its site. It added that a software update should ""prevent any movement of the stolen coins from the attacker's address"" but only if other investors installed it ""immediately"". ""We appreciate the community's patience, understanding, and support while we work to rectify the situation,"" it added. The news site Coindesk reported that several crypto-currency exchanges had taken steps to freeze trade in Tether following the announcement. Coindesk also reported that Tether had links to Bitfinex - a Hong Kong-based exchange that reported a hack last year  blamed for about $65m of losses - although the report added that the ""nature of the connection"" was unclear. The BBC has contacted Tether to seek clarification on the matter. Other recent controversies involving digital currencies include:"

Manx Utilities (MU) has confirmed the company had not paid all of its invoices on time or in full between September and February. All of the natural gas purchased for sale on the island by Manx Gas is done via MU. Manx Gas said it had been ""quite open about the difficulties"" it had faced. The gas provider's overdue debt has now reduced to £2.4m, with a further £3.2m ""invoiced but not yet due for payment"", MU said.  It added that £2.3m in payments due from Manx Gas had been cancelled on 24 December, and some later payments were made more than 70 days after they were due.  It was recently revealed that MU had refused a request to forward-purchase gas for the company for winter 2021 as the company was deemed to be a ""credit risk"". A request to extend its payment times from 30 days to 90 had also been rejected by MU in January. Earlier this month, Manx Gas CEO Jo Cox told Tynwald's Economic Policy Review Committee that a new regulatory framework approved by Tynwald in March had since given the company ""stability"". Under the agreement, a 58% hike in bills for gas customers came into force on 1 April, in response to the current volatility in the wholesale market. In a statement, Ms Cox said it was ""important to understand"" that the issues had arisen before the regulatory agreement was introduced. ""Having this framework in place is vital as prices can now follow the market in a timely manner, giving transparent pricing for all parties,"" she added.

Volatility,"NI economic output at 15-year high, Nisra says",2024-09-25,2022-07-07,By John Campbell,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-62078425,"The Northern Ireland economy continued to grow in the first quarter of 2022, official figures from Nisra suggest. Output was up by 0.4% compared to the final quarter of 2021 and by 7.8% compared to the same period a year ago. NI economic output is now at a 15-year high and just 0.1% below the record output level recorded in the middle of 2007. From late 2007, Northern Ireland experienced a housing crash which caused significant economic damage. Northern Ireland's performance in the first quarter was weaker than the UK average: UK GDP grew by 0.8% quarter-on-quarter and by 8.7% year-on-year. However, the NI Statistics and Research Agency (Nisra) says that over a three-year time period Northern Ireland has grown more strongly with output up by 4.8% compared to UK GDP growth of 1.3%. Nisra uses the three-year comparison in an attempt to mitigate the economic volatility arising from the pandemic. In recent months, Northern Ireland's economic data has become intensely political as supporters and opponents of the NI Protocol attempt to construct economic arguments to support their positions. However, the data is inconclusive with Northern Ireland doing better than the UK average on some metrics and worse on others. In the first quarter of the year, growth in Northern Ireland was largely driven by the service sector which had a positive contribution of 0.4 percentage points (pps). The Public Sector and Production/manufacturing sector also had positive contributions with 0.2 pps and 0.1 pps. However, the Construction sector had a negative contribution of 0.3 pps; construction has faced some of the biggest problems with cost inflation and supply chain delays."
Volatility,In-house gatherings 'vital' for island communities,2024-09-25,2020-11-11,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-54904265,"Leaders of Scotland's three island local authorities have welcomed a relaxation of rules on in-house gatherings. Up to six people from two households can meet in a home from Friday in Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced the move in a statement to the Scottish Parliament on Tuesday. Western Isles authority Comhairle nan Eilean Siar said in-house socialising was vital for ""remote"" communities. People returning to the islands from other places have been asked not to mix with others. Ms Sturgeon said guidance on this matter would be issued later this week. Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles are in level one of the Scottish government's five-level local protection system, but a restriction on a household meeting with another in a home had remained in place. Highland and Moray are also in level one, but the restriction on in-house gatherings will not been lifted. Ms Sturgeon said this was due to ""volatility"" in cases. Roddie MacKay, leader of Comhairle nan Eilean Siar, welcomed the relaxed rules for his region. He said: ""We have got remote rural villages where there is no infrastructure - cafes and restaurants - where people can go and meet their families. ""Then you have issues with the winter weather here and it wouldn't be realistic to expect people to meet outside."" Steven Coutts, leader of Shetland Islands Council, said Shetland had met the Scottish government's indicators for level one for ""many months"". He said: ""It is good to see that reflected in the removal of the in-home visit ban. It is a demonstration that others have listened, reflected on the same evidence we have been pointing to, and that our repeated calls were fully justified."""
Volatility,Business and farmers welcome deal,2024-09-25,2018-11-15,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-46220456,"The draft Brexit deal has received a cautious welcome from the Northern Ireland business and farming community.  Agreement has been reached between the UK and EU on the Irish border, the main sticking point in the talks. The agreement states there will be nothing to prevent unfettered market access for goods moving from Northern Ireland to the rest of the UK. Certain goods coming into Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK would be subject to new checks and controls. The draft deal still needs to be voted on by MPs. ""The situation remains very fluid and we are reviewing the document in detail. Ultimately, we would like a UK wide solution - full stop. ""However, this agreement does provide an insurance policy to prevent a no deal outcome, which would be disastrous for farm businesses and the economy in Northern Ireland. ""Farmers here provide safe, traceable and affordable food, while at the same time meeting some of the highest animal welfare and environmental standards in the world ""We have always argued that any deal, as far as possible, must allow the agriculture industry free and frictionless trade with the EU. ""Agri-food is the cornerstone of the Northern Ireland economy and any significant barriers to trade between Northern Ireland and EU member states, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, or Northern Ireland and Great Britain would have a major impact."" ""The agreement is the best of a bad situation at the minute. ""At least it is an agreement and it is better than a no deal, which is what a lot of businesses in Northern Ireland had started to prepare for. ""It says two things: [goods] could be checked at point of source and other points. ""But live goods are already checked coming into Northern Ireland, so it just depends on exactly where the UK wants to check those goods and how they want to check them. ""What's on the table now is not ideal, but it's definitely moving in the right direction and most businesses will take it."" ""This provides a basis for certainty for small businesses, and a means to avoid a hard border. ""We are acutely aware of the political machinations which are ongoing, however it must be remembered that without a withdrawal agreement, the UK will crash out in March 2019 without a transition period, nor agreement on citizens' rights, nor any plan to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. ""We believe that the draft withdrawal agreement is a significant step back from the cliff edge, which would result in a chaotic no deal Brexit that would be deeply damaging and dangerous for our small firms. ""Our first reaction is relief - we feel that the government have actually listened to us.  ""We set out proposals two years ago about what we needed to keep the UK and Northern Ireland goods flowing freely and this, although it's not perfect, ticks a lot of boxes.  ""We have to avoid friction on the island of Ireland - for goods here in Northern Ireland, we're so reliant on cross border movement.  ""For every 10 trucks that leave the Republic of Ireland coming into Northern Ireland, seven are carrying components or ingredients for goods we make here and that we send to Great Britain, so if we did have any friction or tariff on the Irish border, that not only jeopardises the competitiveness of our products, but also their mere existence. ""So there's relief, but there's a lot more work to be done."" ""NIFDA welcomes the draft withdrawal agreement as a positive development in the ongoing Brexit negotiations, and we would be hopeful that this will enable more substantive talks around our future trading relationship with the EU. ""We must be clear on the fact that a no-deal outcome would be disastrous for Northern Ireland, particularly for the agri-food sector. ""We simply could not absorb increased customs, tariffs and regulatory costs on trade between Northern Ireland and the EU. ""Whilst this agreement may not be perfect, and further clarification on certain aspects will be required, it is vastly preferable to a no-deal scenario."" ""Business leaders have been desperate for this stage of the negotiations to reach a conclusion, and although it has taken longer than firms would have liked, it is clear definitive progress has been made between the UK and EU. ""We are heartened to see that provision has been made for an extension to the transition period, which may be needed not only to avoid the deployment of the backstop, but also to ensure firms have time to adjust to any changes once the new economic partnership is agreed. ""We also urge all politicians to think long and hard about how they react to this first-stage agreement.  ""Leaving the EU without a deal is a very bad outcome for businesses, workers and consumers, and this is simply an inherent risk that comes with voting down any withdrawal deal."" ""Business will clearly welcome last night's announcement in that there is now better clarity on the terms of a deal, however many will also be reluctant to put contingency plans on hold until there is a stronger signal on whether this will hold politically in the UK and Europe.  ""The backstop guarantee is a positive development for NI firms operating on an all-island basis, not least the restatement that both sides intend to work towards a free trade agreement longer term, which should not be overlooked. ""The scale of political uncertainty and the volatility which this creates can be seen in the significant currency fluctuations we have witnessed in the past 24 hours. Firms should not take this lightly and as such, factor these continued unknowns into their scenario planning."" ""The deal provides solutions to customs, tariffs and an innovative solution on VAT. ""However, there is some work to be done by both the Westminster government and the EU on the checks and administration for goods coming into Northern Ireland from GB. ""This will need to be light touch and be mitigated in further agreements, hopefully to an absolute bare minimum. ""We have always said the backstop is better than no deal."" ""The EU has made important concessions which would help NI businesses if the backstop is ever implemented. ""The fears and risks flagged by business seem, so far, to have been addressed. ""The issues of VAT remains a HMRC responsibility and there will be no quotas, origin rules nor tariffs between Britain and Northern Ireland."""
Volatility,Chance to reset economic policy - Lord Offord,2024-09-25,2022-10-16,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-63276360,"A Scotland Office minister has said the new chancellor now has a chance to reset the economy after the recent financial turmoil.  Scottish financier Lord Offord said mistakes had been made but backed the prime minister's emphasis on growth.  He said the mini-budget had moved ""too far, too fast"", and restoring stability was now vital. The Scottish government has accused the Conservatives of crashing the economy and worsening cost of living pressures. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said Liz Truss is as much to blame for the current volatility as her sacked chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng and she should ""carry the can"" for her actions.  She told BBC News: ""I think the only decent thing that Tory backbenchers can do now is call time on Liz Truss and this entire UK government, and allow people across the UK to have a general election."" Lord Offord, who is a parliamentary under secretary of state for Scotland, said Ms Truss should be given more time to deliver her vision, and stressed the need for stability in the face of international financial challenges. He told BBC Scotland's The Sunday Show: ""Mortgage rates are going up with overriding pressure in the world economy, particularly inflation. And that inflation is now heading at 10% in this country, and half of that is attributed to the energy crisis."" He said with hindsight, the UK government should have focused first on its measures for dealing with energy inflation, then come back with a balanced budget.  But the financier insisted the UK had become stuck with a low growth, high tax economy and that in the longer term this needed to be tackled. ""Our public services are growing at 3% per annum - the cost of them is growing at 3% per annum - our revenue is growing at 1.5%. Those sums don't add up. The long term direction of travel has to be that we get back to being a higher growth economy,"" he said. He accepted that measures to address low growth had to be introduced in a ""stable environment"" and in an ""orderly fashion"". ""The chancellor has been very candid. He says mistakes have been made, those mistakes have been rectified. We now have an opportunity to reset this on the 31 October,"" he said.  The UK government plans to deliver more details of its fiscal plan and accompanying economic forecasts on that date.  The new chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, has said every government department would be asked to make savings, but insisted it would be nothing like the period of austerity that began in 2010. Alistair Darling, who was Labour's chancellor at the time of the 2008 financial crash, said he did not think Ms Truss could survive as prime minister. He told BBC Scotland: ""I think she is finished. It is only a matter of time.  ""She was the author of this policy which has so spectacularly blown up. It is a self-inflicted wound."" Reflecting on his own experience as chancellor in a period of financial turmoil, he said: ""You have got to do more than people expect and you have got to do it more quickly than people expect. And, ultimately, you need to take people with you."" Mr Darling said replacing Ms Truss with another Conservative leader was not the answer, and he added his voice to calls for a general election. "
Volatility,Why West Africa wants a single currency,2024-09-25,2019-07-06,By Louise Dewast,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-48882030,"Fifteen countries in West Africa have agreed to adopt a single currency next year called the eco. Experts are divided on the impact it would have on the region's economy, especially in the eight member states which use CFA franc - which is backed by France. Negotiations for the joint currency have been in the works for 30 years.  The Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas), the region's political and economic union, said the rollout will be gradual with countries meeting the laid-out criteria joining first.  Eight countries already use the CFA franc, which is pegged to the euro, and is guaranteed by France. The other seven have their own currencies, none of them freely convertible. Proponents of the eco say the single currency will facilitate trade, lower transaction costs and facilitate payments amongst Ecowas' 385 million people.  However, critics worry that Nigeria, the region's biggest economy, will dominate monetary policy and stall the projected benefits.  For economists Ferdinand Backoup and Daniel Ndoye, a single currency would prove a valuable instrument in the international monetary system:  ""West African countries - like most other developing countries - are not immune to monetary shocks caused by policies implemented in the rest of the world,"" the pair wrote in a briefing note for the African Development Bank. A single currency can offer a chance, they say, to put up a ""collective and effective front"" against these disruptions. About the ECO It looks extremely unlikely that all 15 countries will meet this target. The single currency was first planned to be introduced in 2003 but the launch has been postponed several times; in 2005, 2010 and 2014. It is possible, although ambitious, that some countries will meet the current criteria for the 2020 deadline - the primary four being: These criteria, along with two other secondary ones, are due to be assessed by Ecowas by the end of 2019. One of the problems is inconsistency: countries could, for example, meet the criteria next year, and then fall behind the following year.  In 2016, only one country, Liberia, met all the six conditions, and no single criterion was met by all the countries.   Economist Martial Belinga, author of Liberate Africa From Monetary Slavery, says 2020 is a symbolic goal. ""It's more about the process,"" he said. ""Having a deadline pushes states to reach the criteria.""  Mr Belinga says Ecowas might want to consider revising the entrance criteria, as long as they remain credible.  Ecowas has said adoption would be gradual though, so the countries that do meet the criteria can join, and the others can follow later.  If the goal is to boost trade, some analysts are sceptical that a single currency is key. ""We struggle in Nigeria alone to get produce from the north to Lagos, and to other southern parts where it can be consumed,"" said Sanyade Okoli, head of Alpha African Advisory. ""If goods can't move freely, how can we even talk about a single currency? she asked. ""We need to address poor infrastructure, bureaucracy - the lower-hanging fruits first"". For Mr Belinga, the real impediment to trade in the region is not the lack of a single currency but that countries don't have much to trade.  ""West African countries must transform their economies, with diversification and added value industries,"" he says.  ""That's the real solution to face external shocks and volatility."" Currently, most countries rely on commodities whose prices are regulated on international markets.  For the economist, the single currency isn't ""an end in itself"". Although talk of a political federation has not dominated the latest discussions, critics point at pitfalls of running a joint currency without a political union.  Economists Ferdinand Bakoup and Daniel Ndoye say the commitment of regional leaders should allay such fears.  ""The creation of a presidential task force to monitor the single currency creation process, headed by the heads of state of Ghana, Nigeria and Ivory Coast and the Committee of Central Bank governors, is a glaring illustration,"" they said. ""What now remains is to transform this commitment by accelerating the implementation of reforms to help achieve this objective"". You may also be interested in: But despite their will to move forward, many also fear losing part of their sovereignty.  ""As Africa's largest economy and most populous country, we cannot afford to rush into such agreements without full and proper consultation with all stakeholders,"" said Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari. The next Ecowas meeting in December is likely to whip up some of these concerns.  Nigeria, whose oil-dependent economy accounts for two-thirds of the region's GDP, would dominate a future monetary union. Some economists have compared Nigeria to Germany's weight in the eurozone although Nigeria would be far more dominant in the eco. For Ms Okoli, that could be problematic.  ""We should have an honest conversation about how we feel about that,"" she says. ""Germany had a measure of restraint coming out of World War II, but we don't have that in Nigeria,"" she said.  It is, however, less of problem and more of an opportunity,  Mr Belinga argues.  ""There's always a leader in a union and I think we should hope Nigeria will play that role positively. When you look at what they've done for their economy, I see that as a positive signal of good leadership"".  ""At the same time,"" he says, ""Nigeria must see that this is an opportunity for them to access a massive market"". Although some describe the CFA franc as a colonial relic, some analysts say that what's been driving growth in francophone countries like Ivory Coast has been high investment because of low interest rates which come from a stable currency guaranteed by France. The Francophone countries might be hesitant to joining a union with countries that have much higher levels of inflation and interest rates. But the appeal to cut colonial links and embrace the eco as an African project is strong. ""Even if it creates instability, that's normal,"" says Mr Belinga, ""countries must disconnect from the franc"", he adds. "
Volatility,Petrol price record prompts call for fuel duty cut,2024-09-25,2011-01-07,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-12138212,"This video can not be played Rural drivers feel impact of fuel price rise The price of petrol has hit another record high, prompting a small business organisation to urge the government to consider cutting fuel duty.  The average price of unleaded has hit 127.7p per litre, according to Experian Catalist.  The government confirmed it was looking at a fuel price stabiliser, which would cut duty when the price of oil went up.  But the Forum of Private Business has urged the government to just cut duty if this was too difficult to introduce.  Prime Minister David Cameron said he was talking to the Treasury about the possibility of introducing a Fair Fuel Stabiliser, but warned that it was ""not simple"".  It was hoped that such a scheme, mentioned in the party's manifesto, would reduce the volatility of the price of petrol and diesel at the pumps.  Duty would be cut when oil prices rose, and increased when prices fell.  The Forum of Private Business criticised the Conservatives for not following through on their stabiliser pledge, when it was urgently needed.  This video can not be played Misery for hauliers as fuel prices soar ""Instead, it has actually increased duty on fuel by going ahead with two rises inherited from the previous administration, and effectively implemented a further price hike this month with the 2.5% increase in VAT,"" it said.  ""If the fuel price stabiliser is again deemed to be unworkable, a significant reduction in duty - or perhaps a reclassification of the VAT rate on fuel - is desperately needed to help keep businesses moving,"" the business body added.   The price of fuel has risen steadily over the past month due to recent increases in the price of oil, as well as a 0.76p fuel duty increase on New Year's Day, and the VAT rise in the first week of the year.  The AA estimated that the two government measures increases added around 3.5p to the cost of a litre of both petrol and diesel. The average price of unleaded petrol is at a record, but the average price of diesel, currently 132.08p, is still marginally below its all-time high.

Volatility,Oil's bubble trouble,2024-09-25,2023-09-19,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-66861746,"It's pointing northwards again: the price of a barrel of Brent crude oil is a weathervane for the global economy.  The world benchmark has reached the highest level for 10 months, with the spot price peaking on Tuesday lunchtime at $95.72 before falling back a dollar. That's lower than a year ago, and still $25 short of the peak reached in the turmoil of summer 2022, as many countries sought to pivot away from Russian energy supplies and to secure supplies for last winter. In addition, the value of sterling has been sliding against the US dollar, from $1.31 to $1.24 since July 13, and the combined impact has pushed up the cost of fuel for transport and heating. Market analysts think the co-ordinated supply constraints by Saudi Arabia and Russia will keep the price around $95, if not up to the $100 mark.  The oil market was surprised not that these two major exporters were continuing to dial back on production in order to keep the price up, but that they agreed to do so to the end of this year. Rystad Energy published market analysis on Tuesday, saying the current price should be seen as the new normal for oil, with demand continuing to grow through to the end of this decade. The consultancy says the lower prices associated with the recent cycles of boom and bust investment, which brought a glut of oil from fracking in the USA and prices in the mid-fifty dollar range, should be seen as abnormal. The US was able, for a while, to control the dial on world prices, but that power to control supply seems to have passed back to the Saudi-led OPEC export cartel with its Russian friend. The less clear part of the market is whether demand is heading up or down. There are numerous conflicting signals, and for now, market sentiment is listening to the more positive ones for Chinese growth, and therefore increased energy demand. This is a much more complex picture than it used to be. Economic growth required the fuel of oil, so demand went up. But that has been at least partly de-coupled.  It's possible to grow the economy while using less energy more efficiently, and sometimes because the transition to new energy sources is itself helping the economy. The market is tangled with the politics and finance of net zero, in which this most important and influential of commodities is being shunned, for environmental reasons, by some of those people, countries and economies which are set to continue relying on it for years to come. In the UK, the windfall profits from recent spikes in both oil and gas prices continue to mean much higher tax rates, currently at 75% of profits from UK waters, and continued tax uncertainty about whether a future Labour government will tighten investment allowances, or if lower prices, at least for gas, could see the tax eased. And it is likely to play as one of the big issues separating the main parties in the Westminster election campaign, in which the SNP is trying for ambiguity: continued oil and gas if emissions are minimised or mitigated while trying to show leadership on the ""just transition"" to renewables energy.  It's not such an easy message for Humza Yousaf to sell at the United Nations in New York while, back home, former SNP leader Alex Salmond says the approach is folly: ""It would be plain daft to sacrifice such an overwhelming bounty for Scotland when Scotland's oil and gas can be the engine room of an independent Scotland and the resource which is used to fund the development of a Net Zero future.""  Meanwhile, the politics of energy have got creatives in a spin. According to The Drum, news website for the advertising industry, influencers are shunning renewable energy for fear of being accused of green-washing, but at the same time, the oil and gas industry wants to use their media power to further its arguments. One analysis of numerous contracts awarded in the PR industry, by the campaign group Clean Creatives, illustrates just how hard the oil and gas sector is working to fight its corner.  That group is putting pressure on advertising agencies to distance themselves from such work under a threat of being tainted in the eyes of anti-oil campaigners and other clients. We know the big public brands that drill worldwide and sell from the forecourt, such as Shell and BP, are struggling to avoid brand damage from campaigns against the industry. A month ago, Bernard Looney, BP's chief executive, was saying the industry required ""stability and predictability"" from government. That looked an unfortunate irony last week when he left abruptly over inappropriate relationships with staff. The company, meanwhile, was quietly pocketing a UK government licence to re-develop the Murlach field, 125 miles east of Aberdeen - one of around a hundred licences Rishi Sunak says he wants to award. The bigger players can claim to mitigate some of this drilling activity with 14 companies gaining 21 licences, also granted last week, for the storage of captured carbon.  It's claimed these could be storing a tenth of the UK's emissions by the end of the decade, in carbon sinks covering a sea area the size of Yorkshire. Others in the industry are sceptical about that timescale. While majors see a $95 oil price as the time to get back to investing, the battle over their brands opens up opportunities for smaller oil and gas companies. They have less reason to worry about their public images while private equity and other countries' wealth funds continue to back them. For a flavour of what's going on, here is just some recent news from big though less well-known UK drillers, mostly based in Scotland: But without such brand and public pressure, Ithaca now has 100%, and will only pay out to Shell once production starts and the earnings start to roll in, or if it sells on that stake. But without mentioning the election, it warned that beyond next year lies uncertainty.  It is looking to diversify away from its exposure to Britain's tax volatility, with mergers and acquisitions. Harbour is one of those firms pushing into carbon capture and storage, including a role in the Acorn project based around north-east Scotland. It published half-year figures that put it into the red, which is quite an achievement at recent prices. In the first half of last year, as commodity prices soared, it made a profit of $203m (£164m), but this year, that became a $21m (£17m) loss. A key contributor to that was the $76m (£61m) bill for the Energy Profits Levy, the UK windfall tax. Those financial results took 13% off the share price. In the past year, it has halved. That contributes to the difficulty of continuing to invest in UK waters.  Said the chief executive: ""The UK's oil and gas sector faces significant challenges and loss of competitiveness due to uncertainty following the adverse changes to the fiscal regime"". But a shareholder revolt earlier this year has seen a sharp change of direction. Again, higher UK tax has encouraged it to exit British investment.  New management has sold all its assets apart from reserves in Egypt, handed shareholders hundreds of millions of dollars from its drilling war-chest, and shed 80% of its UK-based staff. Only 30 remain in a smaller Edinburgh headquarters.  The London office is being closed, and there are only 20 more staff, in Cairo - another Scottish corporate success story that is running, literally, into the sand."
Volatility,Five ways the Ukraine war could push up prices,2024-09-25,2022-02-24,By Lora Jones,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60509453,"Severe sanctions on Russia aim to isolate the country and create a deep recession there, but the economic fallout will also be felt by people around the world. The sharp rise in the prices of things from oil and metals to wheat is expected to push up the cost of many everyday items from food to petrol and heating. People in the UK and Europe are already paying high prices for energy and fuel. The Russia-Ukraine conflict has so far driven these even higher and caused the price of oil to jump to level in almost 14 years, while wholesale gas prices have more than doubled.  If gas prices stay at that level, energy analysts have warned that household fuel bills in the UK could reach as much as £3,000 a year, while average UK petrol prices have repeatedly hit record highs, with the latest price at 155p and diesel at 161p.  Russia is the second-biggest exporter of crude oil, and the world's largest natural gas exporter, which is vital to heating homes, powering planes and filling cars with fuel. The UK gets only 6% of its crude oil and 5% of its gas from Russia, but the EU sources nearly half of its gas from the country. If one country reliant on Russian supplies receives less gas, they have to replace it, impacting the supplies of gas for other countries - that's why British energy prices and bills are still affected in a similar way to European ones. There are fears President Vladimir Putin might ""weaponise"" Russia's natural resources by reducing supplies of gas to Europe in response to sanctions. Politicians in Germany are calling for a ""national gas reserve"" to be created to protect consumers from price shocks. Meanwhile, the US is discussing a potential ban on buying Russian energy which has also fuelled price rises. Plane fuel is also linked to the price of crude oil and Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary has warned tickets for this summer will be higher than 2019, partly because of the rise in the price of oil. UK food producers don't import many items from Russia or Ukraine, but prices here may still rise because of an increase in associated costs, such as tinned cans and packaging and transport. Meanwhile, the cost of everyday food items might rise in places like Turkey and North Africa, which rely on wheat and corn from Ukraine and Russia. Both countries, once dubbed ""the breadbasket of Europe"", export about a quarter of the world's wheat and half of its sunflower products, like seeds and oil. Ukraine also sells a lot of corn globally. Analysts have warned that war could impact the production of grains and even double global wheat prices. More than 40% of Ukraine's wheat and corn exports went to the Middle East or Africa last year - and disruptions to supply could affect availability in these areas. The UK, by contrast, typically produces more than 90% of the wheat consumed in the country. But farmers here might find themselves paying more for fertiliser, which is one of Russia's biggest exports. Inflation, which measures how fast the cost of living rises over time, hit 7.5% in January in the US - the highest level seen there since February 1982 - and rose by 5.5% in the UK.  But one economist has warned it could rise close to 10% in major Western economies if the cost of energy and food is pushed up by dwindling supplies cause by the Russian-Ukraine conflict. Such a figure might encourage the Bank of England and the US Federal Reserve to increase interest rates. The idea is that when borrowing is more expensive, people will have less money to spend. As a result, they will buy fewer things, and prices will stop rising as fast. But in the UK, for example, about 2.2 million homeowners with mortgages linked to the Bank of England's base rate would see repayments go up, putting further pressure on household budgets that are already being squeezed by the cost of living. Russian stocks crashed by as much as 45% in the wake of the Ukraine invasion with trading subsequently suspended, with banks and oil companies among the worst affected.  It also led to steep falls on stock markets elsewhere around the world: in Europe the UK's FTSE 100 index has fallen over 6% since Russia crossed into Ukraine while Germany's Dax index is nearly 10% lower. Many people's reaction to stock market changes is that they are not directly affected, because they don't invest money in stocks and shares. But there are millions of people with a pension whose savings are invested in the stock market. If widespread falls in share prices are sustained then it's likely to be bad news for pension savers because the value of their savings pot is influenced by the performance of investments. Some investors or savers might look to protect their money or assets by moving them to traditional ""safe havens"", like gold, especially as the markets are likely to see more volatility as the crisis develops. But pension savings, like any investments, are usually a long-term bet and advisers say it's important not to panic about short-term movements up or down. As a leading commodities exporter, Russia is one of the world's largest suppliers of metals used in everything from aluminium cans, to copper wires, to car components, such as nickel, which is used in lithium-iron batteries, and palladium, which is used in catalytic converters. Everyday goods - which may seem far removed from the conflict - may rise as a result of it. ""When you buy your drinks can made of aluminium, or when you make renovations to your house and you need copper for your wiring, all of those prices do go into the overall inflationary pressure,"" the boss of the London Metals Exchange has warned. If Vladimir Putin decided to cut off supplies of these metals in retaliation to sanctions, existing supply problems could worsen, with car firms having to find alternative sources. Russia is also home to manufacturing hubs for brands like Stellantis, Volkswagen and Toyota. Some production has already been paused at Russian car plants, while shipping and delivery companies halting activity to and from the country is likely to impact the availability of new cars."
Volatility,Oil prices rise as Saudi Arabia pledges output cuts,2024-09-25,2023-06-04,By Jemma Dempsey,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-65804768,"Oil prices have risen after Saudi Arabia said it would make cuts of a million barrels per day (bpd) in July. Other members of Opec+, a group of oil-producing countries, also agreed to continued cuts in production in an attempt to shore up flagging prices. Opec+ accounts for around 40% of the world's crude oil and its decisions can have a major impact on oil prices. In Asia trade on Monday, Brent crude oil rose by as much as 2.4% before settling at around $77 a barrel. Opec+ said production targets would drop by a further 1.4 million bpd from 2024. The seven hour-long meeting on Sunday of the oil-rich nations came against a backdrop of falling energy prices.  Oil prices soared when Russia invaded Ukraine last year, but are now back at levels seen before the conflict began. In October last year Opec+, a formulation which refers to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, agreed to cut production by two million bpd, about 2% of global demand. In April this year the group agreed to a further cuts, which were due to last to the end of this year. But Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said that Sunday's talks led to ""the extension of the deal until the end of 2024"". On Sunday, Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said that his country's cut of one million bpd could be extended beyond July if needed. ""This is a Saudi lollipop,"" he said, in what is seen as a bid to stabilise the market. Before the two-day Opec+ meeting started, it was widely expected the oil cartel would make production cuts to prop up prices. It appears most members were against the idea, as any cuts would impact oil revenues, which are crucial to keep running their economies.  Saudi Arabia's decision to make a voluntary reduction of one-million barrels per day was unexpected but does not come as a huge surprise. As the leader of the pack, and also the largest exporter of oil, it was the only one in a position to be able to lower output.  From Riyadh's point of view, it is crucial the price of crude remains over $80 a barrel for it to break even. Saudi officials want elevated prices to keep spending billions of dollars on ambitious projects spearheaded by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, as he tries to diversify the kingdom's economy away from oil. The move by the Saudis also underlines the uncertain outlook for demand for fuels in the months to come. Concerns about the global economy, especially recessionary fears in the US and Europe are expected to put further pressure on crude prices. Oil producers are grappling with falling prices and high market volatility amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The West has accused Opec of manipulating prices and undermining the global economy through high energy costs. It has also accused the group of siding with Russia despite sanctions over the invasion of Ukraine.   In response, Opec insiders have said the West's monetary policy over the last decade has driven inflation and forced oil-producing nations to act to maintain the value of their main export."
Volatility,Cryptocurrency heist hacker returns $260m in funds,2024-09-25,2021-08-11,By Mary-Ann Russon,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-58180692,"The hacker behind one of the largest cryptocurrency heists to date has returned almost half of the $600m (£433m) stolen assets. On Tuesday, the firm affected, Poly Network wrote a letter on Twitter, asking the individual to get in touch ""to work out a solution"".  The hacker then posted messages pledging to return funds, claiming to be ""not very interested in money"". On Wednesday, Poly Network said it had received $260m back. The company, a blockchain platform which lets users swap different types of digital tokens, posted on Twitter that it had been sent back three cryptocurrencies, including $3.3m worth of Ethereum, $256m worth of Binance Coin and $1m worth of Polygon. A total of $269m in Ether tokens and $84m in Polygon tokens has yet to be recovered.   A blockchain is a ledger, or log, of every single transaction made of a cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin.  The ledger is distributed to all the users in the network to verify all new transactions when they occur, instead of being held by any one single authority. The hacker published a three-page-long Q&A session on one of the blockchains essentially in the form of a self-interview, according to Tom Robinson, co-founder of Elliptic, a London-based blockchain analytics and compliance firm. The hacker claimed to have always planned to return the tokens and said the heist was carried out to highlight vulnerabilities in Poly Network software. ""I know it hurts when people are attacked, but shouldn't they learn something from those hacks?"" the hacker wrote in the notes embedded on the Ethereum blockchain. The hacker claimed to have spent all night looking for a vulnerability to exploit. They said they were worried that Poly Network would patch the security flaw quietly without telling anyone, so they decided to take millions of dollars in cryptocurrency tokens to make a point.  But they stressed that they did not want to cause a ""real panic [in] the crypto-world"", so they only took ""important coins"", leaving behind Dogecoin, the cryptocurrency that started off as a joke.  ""Either they just intended to commit theft and steal the assets, or they were acting like a white hat hacker to expose a bug, to help Poly Network make themselves more strong and secure,"" Mr Robinson, who routinely advises governments and law enforcement agencies about crypto-related crimes, told the BBC. He added that the nature of blockchain technology makes it hard for cyber-criminals to profit from stealing digital currencies, because everyone can see the money being moved across the network into the hackers' wallets. ""I wonder whether this hacker stole the funds, realised how much publicity and attention they were getting, realised wherever they moved the funds they would be watched, and decided to give it back,"" said Mr Robinson. ""The blockchain itself has operated here flawlessly, but the problem is on blockchains like Ethereum, you can write your own smart contracts. Various services have started offering this, including Poly Network.  ""So whenever a human being writes code, there's a chance they will make a mistake."" Poly Network's platform works by facilitating movement between several blockchains when people trade one cryptocurrency for another, such as trading Binance Coin for Ether. ""The Poly Network is the thing that facilitates the movement between these chains - ultimately, it's software, it's code, and code always has imperfections and defects in it,"" James Chappell, co-founder of London-based cyber-security firm Digital Shadows, told the BBC. ""And that's true of banks, or any financial system. Unfortunately, what seems to have happened here is a party has spotted a weakness in the implementation and exploited it to fool the network into transferring these tokens incorrectly."" Similar attacks have happened to several other services in the last 12 months. These include:  After a rollercoaster 24 hours for the crypto community, it seems the hacker intends to return all or most of the stolen money.   As the criminal posted online: ""The pain suffered is temporary, but memorable."" The claim that it was all an elaborate way to force Poly Network to fix security failings is being treated with scepticism. Why the taunting and boasting online if the motive was honourable?  There's some suggestion that the net may have been closing in, as one cyber-security company says it was close to working out the identity of a suspect.  It might have been the case that the hacker bit off way more than they could chew and got scared, so returned the money. Regardless, the authorities will still no doubt be working hard to find them. But what this story mostly points to is just how powerful hackers can be and how powerless the unregulated, decentralised cryptocurrency world is when someone swipes a large fortune from under its nose."
Volatility,"Energy bills forecast to rise above £4,000 in April",2024-09-25,2022-10-18,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63298057,"Typical household energy bills could reach £4,347 a year from April after the government said it would scale back support, an analyst has estimated. Cornwall Insight's forecast comes after the chancellor said the energy bill help, which had been due to last for two years, would be cut in April. The government said the most vulnerable would continue to be protected from soaring energy prices. The forecasts could change depending on movements in wholesale energy prices. The new Chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, announced the change to the energy price support as part of a package of measures designed to save money after the government's mini-budget left a big projected hole in the public finances. On Monday, he said ""it would not be responsible to continue exposing public finances to unlimited volatility in international gas prices"".  The government's Energy Price Guarantee, which limits the price that suppliers can charge for each unit of energy, was originally put in place for two years from 1 October.  Now it will only be in place for six months, covering this winter, with the Treasury reviewing the support given from April. Under the current cap consumers still pay for the gas and electricity they use. A typical household - one that uses 12,000 kWh (kilowatt hours) of gas a year and 2,900 kWh of electricity - currently faces an annual bill of £2,500. That is up from £1,277 last winter. The details of support from April will be decided following a review, Mr Hunt said. He said those on lower incomes would be supported and there will be incentives to be more energy efficient. Predictions from Cornwall Insight suggest that, for households that do not receive any support, a typical annual energy bill could be £4,347 in the spring, dropping to £3,722 next winter. The loss of the two-year cap will introduce a ""considerable amount of anxiety about the future again"", Nigel Pocklington, boss of renewable energy supplier Good Energy, told the BBC's Today programme. Mr Pocklington, whose firm has about 300,000 customers, said that his reassurances to people were based on the government ""buffering them from the high levels of energy market through the winter"".  However, on ""current calculations without the government support"", he estimated that the average energy bill would reach around £4,300 in April, dropping below £4,000 by the summer.  ""These are extraordinarily high levels compared with what we are used to paying,"" he said.   Sharing this concern, Mary Starks, former executive director for consumers and markets at energy regulator Ofgem, told the Today programme that the move had put people back into a position of ""great uncertainty"".   On the promise of targeted help, Ms Starks criticised the government for being ""very unclear"" because who will be affected and how it will work has not been explained.  ""Even extending eligibility to everyone on universal credit is administratively complicated. ""The number of households who will be struggling will be a lot bigger than that so there is more work needed to do the targeting,"" she added.  The original plan to cap prices for two years - thought to cost up to £150bn - was to be funded through government borrowing after the prime minister rejected calls to extend a windfall tax on oil and gas firms. However, former Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng followed it with plans to cut taxes by some £45bn. Concerns about rising borrowing sparked turmoil on financial markets which spilled over into the mortgage market, where interest rates on loans have surged to 14-year highs. On Monday, as he announced the review of the energy support, while also reversing £32bn worth of the planned tax cuts, Mr Hunt said he was doing ""what is necessary for economic stability"". He added that the Energy Price Guarantee had been ""the biggest single expense"" of Mr Kwarteng's growth plan."
Volatility,Call for tougher crypto rules after FTX collapse,2024-09-25,2022-11-21,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63704034,"Better regulations are needed to protect the financial system after the collapse of the FTX cryptocurrency exchange, a senior Bank of England official has said. Digital currencies are still too small to pose a threat but that will soon change, said Sir Jon Cunliffe.  FTX filed for bankruptcy last week and owes its largest creditors almost $3.1bn (£2.6bn). Thousands of its users are also waiting to get their money back. Sir Jon, who is deputy governor for financial stability at the Bank, also said the recent volatility in the value of cryptocurrencies posed a threat.  The value of Bitcoin, the world's largest digital currency, has dived by almost 70% in the last year. He said the crypto world was, at present, not ""large enough or interconnected enough with mainstream finance to threaten the stability of the financial system"".  But he said its links with mainstream finance were developing rapidly. ""We should not wait until it is large and connected to develop the regulatory frameworks necessary to prevent a crypto shock that could have a much greater destabilising impact. ""The experience in other areas of digitalisation has demonstrated the difficulty of retrofitting regulation on new technologies and new business models after they have reached systemic scale,"" he told an audience at a Warwick Business School event. It comes as the UK is set to approve laws in the Financial Services and Markets Bill, which is currently in Parliament. The bill will introduce regulation for stable coins - a crypto asset backed by an asset such as a currency - and the marketing of crypto assets. Before FTX collapsed, its then-CEO Sam Bankman-Fried took every chance he could to describe his firm as ""the most regulated"" in the industry. It's true that FTX had collected dozens of permissions to operate in many countries and to offer many different crypto services.  But clearly, in the end, those certificates were useless at protecting customers and investors. Every time there is a major crisis in crypto the cries for regulation grow, but it's the type of regulation that matters. The chief concerns for authorities seem to be about protecting customers from crypto firms going bust and ensuring that they don't run off with people's money. But as ever with cryptocurrency there is a tension between safety and freedom. Regulating crypto firms to ensure they are safe and responsible entities would bring them a step closer to the traditional financial system - a huge no-no for crypto believers. But whatever the true believers want, the FTX chaos may well be the point of no return. In his speech, Sir Jon noted that the UK's financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, had been warning for several weeks before FTX's collapse that ""this firm may be providing financial services or products in the UK without our authorisation… you are unlikely to get your money back if things go wrong"". FTX did not have a licence to operate in the UK, but its implosion has caused shockwaves around the world. The company's filings have revealed that more than one million people and businesses could be owed money following its collapse. On Saturday, FTX said it had launched a review of its global assets and was preparing for the sale or reorganisation of some businesses.  Last week, new FTX chief executive John Ray hit out at the way the failed crypto exchange was run, saying he had never ""seen such a complete failure of corporate controls"". Mr Ray, who replaced the company's founder Sam Bankman-Fried, criticised what he called a ""complete absence of trustworthy financial information"". Mr Bankman-Fried was one of the crypto world's most high-profile personalities, with the 30-year-old becoming a billionaire in 2021. His FTX crypto exchange grew to be the second largest in the world, with $10bn-$15bn traded a day. It spent millions on advertising, including during the Superbowl, and last year it acquired the naming rights for the Miami Heat NBA team's arena. Mr Bankman-Fried also projected an unconventional approach to business, tweeting pictures of himself sleeping on a beanbag next to his desk in the office. Despite the ructions in the crypto world caused by FTX's collapse, Sir Jon said the need for a UK digital currency was still being considered by the Bank of England. He said the work on a digital pound was driven by ""the reducing role of cash, and more generally in the increasing digitalisation of daily life"". Sir Jon said the Bank planned to issue a consultative report around the end of the year setting out the possible next steps."
Volatility,Global bank stocks slump despite Biden reassurances,2024-09-25,2023-03-12,By Daniel Thomas & Natalie Sherman,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-64935170,"Bank shares in Asia and Europe have slumped, despite reassurances from the US president that America's financial system is safe following the collapse of two US lenders. The falls come after authorities moved to protect customer deposits when the US-based Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank collapsed.  Joe Biden promised to do ""whatever is needed"" to protect the banking system. But investors fear other lenders may still be hit by the fallout. On Tuesday, Japan's Topix Banks share index fell by more than 7%, putting it on course for its worst day in more than three years. Shares of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, the country's largest lender by assets, were down by 8.1% in mid-day Asian trading.  On Monday, Spain's Santander and Germany's Commerzbank saw their share prices dive by more than 10% at one point.  A string of smaller US banks suffered even worse losses than European counterparts, despite reassuring customers that they had more than enough liquidity to protect themselves from shocks.  The volatility has led to speculation that America's Federal Reserve will now pause its plans to keep raising interest rates, designed to tame inflation. Mr Biden said that people and businesses that had deposited money with Silicon Valley Bank would be able to access all their cash from Monday, after the government stepped in to protect their deposits in full.  Many business customers had faced the prospect of not being able to pay staff and suppliers after their funds were frozen. BBC North America Technology correspondent James Clayton spoke to people queuing up all day outside the SVB branch in Menlo Park, California, to access their funds. As the bank was no longer offering wire transfers, they were taking out their money in cashier cheques.  Silicon Valley Bank - which specialised in lending to technology companies - was shut down by US regulators who seized its assets on Friday. It was the biggest failure of a US bank since the financial crisis in 2008. It had been trying to raise money to plug a loss from the sale of assets affected by higher interest rates. Word of the troubles led customers to race to withdraw funds, leading to a cash crisis.  Authorities on Sunday also took over Signature Bank in New York, which had many clients involved in crypto and was seen as the institution most vulnerable to a similar bank run. Mr Biden promised that covering the deposits would not cost taxpayers anything, and instead be funded by fees regulators charge to banks. As part of efforts to restore confidence, US regulators also unveiled a new way for banks to borrow emergency funds in a crisis.  Yet there is concern that the failures, which came after the collapse of another US lender, Silvergate Bank, last week, are a sign of troubles at other firms.  Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics said the US authorities had ""acted aggressively to prevent a contagion developing"". ""But contagion has always been more about irrational fear, so we would stress that there is no guarantee this will work,"" he added. Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at the stockbrokers AJ Bell, said: ""The first rush of relief has been replaced by niggling concerns that the era of high rates might be more difficult for some banks to stomach than had been previously thought.  ""In the US, bank stocks slid despite Joe Biden's pledge that 'whatever is needed' will be carried out to prevent more dominos from tumbling.""  The failure of SVB has re-ignited debates - similar to those seen following the 2008 financial crisis - about how much the government should do to regulate and protect banks. The chair of the US Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, says there will be a thorough and transparent review of the collapse. Mr Biden called for tougher rules and emphasised that investors and bank leaders would not be spared. ""They knowingly took a risk... that's how capitalism works,"" he said. Still, Republican Senator Tim Scott, seen as a potential presidential candidate in 2024, called the rescue ""problematic"". ""Building a culture of government intervention does nothing to stop future institutions from relying on the government to swoop in after taking excessive risks,"" he said. Once again people are worried about banks. Once again there is intense debate about bailouts. But this isn't 2008. Following the global financial crisis, the focus was on reforming banks considered ""too big to fail"". Today's problems are centred around medium- and smaller-sized banks.   Both of the banks that collapsed - Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank - had the same thing in common: their business models were too concentrated in one sector and they were over exposed to assets whose values came under pressure from rising interest rates.  The criticism is that they should have foreseen this and they didn't. US Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has gone to great lengths to signal the Fed's intention to raise interest rates. Since most banks are well diversified and have plenty of cash on hand, the assumption is that the risk to the rest of the banking sector is low. That won't stop regulators looking into what went wrong and what rules need to change.  And the pressure on small- and medium-sized banks hasn't gone away. What happens to the US economy and the fight against inflation also remains to be seen."
Volatility,Crypto-currencies gaining popularity in Kenya,2024-09-25,2019-02-22,By Mary-Ann Russon,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-47307575,"Interest in virtual currencies is rising across the African continent, especially in Kenya, Africa's Silicon Valley. Despite warnings from Kenya's central bank about the volatility of crypto-currencies, some businesses in Nairobi are now accepting Bitcoin payments. The total number of Bitcoin transactions in Kenya are estimated to be worth over $1.5m, according to the Blockchain Association of Kenya. But can the technology really take off? Crypto-currencies are virtual money that can be used to pay for things in the real world, such as a hotel room, food or even a house. Digital tokens are held in online wallets, and can be sent anonymously between users. Crypto-currencies run on a technology called blockchain - a ledger of blocks of information, such as transactions or agreements, that are stored across a network of computers. The information is stored chronologically and is designed to be de-centralised and tamper-proof. While this provides security, it also means there is no oversight from a central authority such as a bank or a government. The first-ever blockchain-backed currency developed was Bitcoin, and it continues to be the most widely-used globally. At the moment, the crypto-currencies Bitcoin, Dash and Lisk are used in Botswana, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa and Zimbabwe. Blockchain is also being implemented by start-ups and tech conglomerates alike in Kenya to help solve problems, such as IBM's platform to help small businesses to prove their creditworthiness for loans.  Tony Mwongera, the chief executive of Healthland Spa in Nairobi, began accepting Bitcoin payments in 2018. ''I decided to adopt the use of crypto-currencies because there was so much theft in my business,"" he told the BBC. ""So I said, let me use a way that can be safe, secure and I can also embrace technology."" Healthland Spa customers told the BBC that they like the convenience of using crypto-currencies to pay for purchases.  However, if you look at the total number of people in Kenya using virtual currencies today, it is still relatively small - only about 40,000 people have ever made a transaction using Bitcoin. Part of the reason crypto-currency penetration isn't growing that much is because Kenya's central bank has forbidden banks from dealing in virtual currencies. Banks are not allowed to open accounts for people who are known to dealing in any virtual currency, which means that the population cannot easily convert Bitcoin payments into cash or mobile money. ""Crypto-currencies can facilitate and ensure that you do an unlimited number of transactions, however the volatility, lack of control and the non-acceptability of crypto-currencies across different jurisdictions impairs what you'd expect a currency to do,"" economist and policy expert Vincent Kimosop told the BBC.  The Blockchain Association of Kenya (BAK) disagrees with this way of thinking, and it is actively working to educate the country on the benefits of using crypto-currencies and blockchain.  The non-profit body says that using virtual currencies can greatly reduce the cost of transactions, and enable people without bank accounts to quickly make and receive payments. According to BAK, there are many things Kenyans have realised they can use Bitcoin for - whether it is to pay merchants in China for goods, or to enable Nigerians to pay to send their children to school in Kenya, or to enable young African freelancers to be easily paid for their work online.

Volatility,Amazon and Intel drive US markets lower,2024-09-25,2018-04-02,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-43622434,"Wall Street shares plunged to their lowest level in weeks on Monday in a wide sell-off led by technology firms. Intel was among the biggest losers, after a report that Apple plans to stop using Intel chips for its computers. E-commerce giant Amazon also slid by more than 5%, after new attacks from US President Donald Trump.  The falls extended recent declines triggered by increased debate in the US about competition and privacy rules, as well as tensions over trade. The technology-heavy Nasdaq index lost 193 points, or 2.74%, to close at 6,870.1 The S&P 500 fell 59 points or 2.2% to 2,581.9, while the Dow fell 458.9 points or 1.9% to 23,644.19. Technology companies saw some of the steepest declines on Monday, but the falls touched every sector of the S&P 500. The S&P and the Nasdaq indexes ended the day having given up most of the gains made since a steep sell-off in February, while the Dow closed at its lowest level since November. Analysts said the declines in recent weeks have been triggered by uncertainties over many aspects of the economy, including borrowing costs, trade tensions, debate about data regulations, and driverless car technology. On Monday, China imposed new taxes of up to 25% on 128 US imports worth $3bn, including pork, fruit, nuts and wine, in retaliation for steel and aluminium tariffs the US announced last month. US technology companies with large operations in China could be exposed to retaliation if the dispute escalates. But for firms like Facebook, which ended 2.75% lower and is blocked in China, fears of increased regulation are triggering many of the declines, said Sucharita Kodali, a retail analyst for Forrester Research who tracks Amazon and other companies. ""The lack of regulation [in the US] has been fundamental to the success of these large tech companies ... Their business is dependent on that,"" she said. ""That's the fear."" Ms Kodali said she thinks some of the panic is overblown, since any changes will take time to be implemented. ""It's just so speculative,"" she said. Monday's declines come amid weeks of choppy market trading, which have unsettled investors after last year's the steady upward climb.  The volatility has sparked selling as people cash in on last year's gains and look for new, safe investments. In some cases, investors had specific reasons to dump  stocks on Monday. Bloomberg reported that Apple is developing its own chips to use in its computers, with the transition planned as soon as 2020. The report sent Intel shares down more than 6%. Tesla shares also fell by more than 5%, after the firm was rebuked by US safety regulators for sharing information about a recent crash. Investors are also worried about the company's finances, as it spends heavily to ramp up car production. Amazon reported the steepest decline on the S&P 500, falling 5.2% after Mr Trump tweeted another attack on the firm."
Volatility,Google owner Alphabet misses forecasts,2024-09-25,2019-04-29,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48099862,"Google's parent company, Alphabet, saw its shares drop in after-hours trading after the internet giant missed revenue forecasts. Alphabet, which also owns YouTube, reported $36.3bn (£28bn) in sales for the first quarter, below expectations of $37.33bn. Profits also fell during the three months to 31 March. It was impacted by a fine from the European Commission for blocking rival online search advertisers. Google had to pay €1.5bn (£1.3bn) after it was accused of abusing its market dominance by restricting third-party competitors from displaying search adverts between 2006 and 2016. Including the fine, Alphabet's operating profit dropped to $6.6bn from a previous $7.6bn. Sales growth slowed to 17% in the first three months of the year, below the expansion rate of the previous three months and down from a 26% increase in the same period last year. Alphabet's share price dropped nearly 7% in after-hours trading.  Alphabet also said that the rate of growth in ""paid clicks"" decelerated, slowing to 39% growth compared to 59% at the beginning of 2018. Under the model, companies pay a fee each time one of their adverts is clicked on.   Alphabet chief financial officer Ruth Porat said the firm was experimenting with its ad products as users grow reliant on mobile devices and that it was seeing revenue volatility as a result.  The majority of the firm's revenues (84.5%) came from Google's ad business, which sells links, banners and commercials across its own websites and apps and those of partners. Google's three billion users help make it the world's largest seller of internet ads, according to market research firm EMarketer.  George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""Another EU fine won't have washed well with investors, but in reality it's not the cheque on its way to Brussels that's causing the shares to drop. ""Instead, it's a nasty combination of growth in traffic to Google ads slowing and lower revenue per click from those ads that's upset the market."" "
Volatility,US banks report gains but shares sink,2024-09-25,2018-04-13,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-43758938,"Profits at JP Morgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo rose in the first three months of the year, but their shares slumped on Friday despite the gains. JP Morgan's profits soared 35% year-on-year, with more modest increases reported at Citigroup and Wells Fargo. Analysts said the share decline was a sign investors had already factored in some of the rise. They were expecting more active stock markets and a lower tax rate to boost results. Shares in all three banks sank more than 2% in early trading, providing a sour start to earnings season, when companies report quarterly performance to investors.  JP Morgan reported profits of $8.7bn (£6.11bn) in the period from $6.4bn last year, despite a decline in investment banking. Revenue increased 10% to $28.5bn, as a strong economy boosted activity at its consumer banking unit and the return of market fluctuations boosted trading, leading its equities unit to a record quarter. Citigroup's profits rose 13%, reaching $4.6bn in the quarter from $4.1bn last year.  Revenues in the quarter were $18.4bn, a 3% increase from the same period in 2017. The firm said volatility boosted its equity trading unit, helping to offset a fall in bond trading. As with JP Morgan, investment banking took a hit. Wells Fargo reported preliminary profits of $5.9bn in the quarter, rising 5% from the same period last year. The results were overshadowed by the firm's ongoing problems with watchdogs. Wells said US regulators have proposed to resolve investigations of vehicle insurance and might force it to restate its results. ""At this time, we are unable to predict final resolution ... and cannot reasonably estimate our related loss contingency,"" the bank said. The firm has been under a cloud since revelations that the bank created more than two million fake accounts to meet sales goals and ignored or punished whistleblowers. Then last year, the bank said it had wrongly charged customers for car insurance, among other problems.  In February, the US Federal Reserve, which regulates banks, said it would restrict the firm's growth until it improved its risk management oversight. Revenue slipped from $22.3bn in the first quarter of 2017 to $21.9bn this period, hurt in part by ""customer-friendly"" changes the bank made to card and overdraft fees. "
Volatility,Adani calls off share sale after price plunges,2024-09-25,2023-02-01,By Michael Race,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-64490221,"India's Adani Enterprises has called off its share sale after the share price plunged on Wednesday. The Adani Group's flagship company confirmed the $2.5bn (£2bn) raised from the sale would be returned to investors after shares fell 26%. The group's companies have seen more than $90bn wiped off their value since a US investment firm made fraud claims. Adani denies the allegations. Gautam Adani, the founder, has fallen out of the top 10 richest in the world. According to the Forbes real-time billionaires list, Mr Adani is now the 15th-richest person in the world, with a net worth of $74.7bn. He was third on the list last week. The billionaire runs Adani Group, one of India's biggest companies. The flagship company Adani Enterprises has operations in a wide range of industries including commodities trading, airports, utilities and renewable energy.  Last week, Hindenburg Research, a company that specialises in ""short-selling"", or betting against a company's share price in the expectation that it will fall, released a report that accused Mr Adani of ""pulling the largest con in corporate history"".  It also alleged the Adani Group had engaged in decades of ""brazen"" stock manipulation and accounting fraud, and claimed its companies had ""substantial debt"" which put the entire group on a ""precarious financial footing"". The group has dismissed the allegations as malicious and untrue, calling them an ""attack on India"". The report came days ahead of a planned sale of Adani shares to the public, and on Tuesday, the $2.5bn share sale in the group's flagship company managed to scrape through to be fully subscribed despite the controversy.  But shares plunged 26.7% on Wednesday, taking the total fall in market value for the group over $90bn, according to Bloomberg. After the market closed, Adani Group said the company would return the share sale proceeds due to ""the unprecedented situation and the current market volatility"". ""Given these extraordinary circumstances, the Company's board felt that going ahead with the issue would not be morally correct,"" said Mr Adani. ""The interest of the investors is paramount and hence to insulate them from any potential financial losses, the Board has decided not to go ahead with the FPO (follow-on public offer)."" Mr Adani said the company's balance sheet was ""very healthy with strong cashflows and secure assets"" ""We have an impeccable track record of servicing our debt,"" he added. ""This decision will not have any impact on our existing operations and future plans."" Adani Group has hit back at the allegations against it and said it was evaluating ""remedial and punitive action"" against Hindenburg Research in the US and India. It said it had always been ""in compliance with all laws"". In an interview with Mint newspaper, the group's chief financial officer compared Hindenburg Research to General Dyer, the British officer of the Bengal Army responsible for a massacre that killed hundreds of Indians in the city of Amritsar in 1919. Hindenburg responded saying the group was stoking a nationalist narrative to obfuscate the fraud allegations."
Volatility,Musk warns Twitter deal stuck without spam proof,2024-09-25,2022-05-17,By Tom Espiner,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-61432483,"Elon Musk has said his $44bn deal to buy Twitter may be in jeopardy due to a disagreement over the number of fake accounts on the social media platform. Mr Musk tweeted that the deal ""cannot move forward"" unless Twitter backs up its claims that less than 5% of daily users are fake or spam accounts. Twitter has defended its figures, adding that Mr Musk waived rights to ""due diligence"" to clinch the deal. The spat has raised doubts about the takeover. Analysts have speculated that Mr Musk may be looking for ways to renegotiate the price of the deal or walk away. Mr Musk agreed the $44bn (£34.5bn) deal to buy Twitter with its board in April, but last week Mr Musk said the deal was ""on hold"" while he sought details about fake accounts. He has continued to press the issue in tweets and public appearances, while also hinting that he could seek a lower price. On Tuesday, Mr Musk said Twitter boss Parag Agrawal had ""publicly refused to show proof"" that fewer than 5% of its accounts were fake, and said the deal ""cannot move forward"" until Mr Agrawal does show proof. Mr Musk's tweet then appeared to be deleted. The billionaire, who also runs carmaker Tesla, has put the number of fake accounts at 20% or more. Elon Musk has doubled down on his position that his deal to buy the social network is on ice while the actual amount of spambots and accounts operating on it is investigated. Twitter chief executive Parag Agrawal has hit back, and tempers are flaring. When the richest man in the world replies to one of your tweets with just one symbol, the poo emoji, well, I suppose at least you know you've got his attention. I long ago gave up trying to read the mind of Elon Musk but let's indulge in a moment of speculation. He's making a big deal about fake accounts. Is it a convenient peg on which to hang a renegotiation? His initial $44bn offer for the firm was considerably higher than its current stock suggests. He moved swiftly and aggressively, perhaps even impulsively. To fund it, he's already had to sell a chunk of shares in one of his other companies, the electric car firm Tesla, and that in turn made a dent in the value of that company as it made other investors nervous. If either party in the Twitter deal walks away now, there's a $1bn termination fee. That may sound like small change to a multi-billionaire - although Mr Musk maintains he is asset-rich rather than cash-rich - but it perhaps gives him leverage to successfully shave a few billion off the offer price, because $1bn is not small change to Twitter and its shareholders. However, Mr Musk might be right to question Twitter's worth. If it really isn't bloated with spam, then perhaps it has less potential to be made great again, a phrase that may sound familiar given that he has already indicated that he would like to re-instate former US President Donald Trump. Mr Trump, by the way, has so far declined the invitation. Mr Musk and Mr Agrawal have been publicly debating the spambot figures on Twitter but relations appear to have soured.  On Monday, Mr Musk responded to Mr Agrawal's defence of the the firm's spam reporting with a poo emoji, later repeating his claim that Twitter was underestimating the figure. Mr Musk has said he is concerned that advertisers on Twitter don't know what they are paying for. ""So how do advertisers know what they're getting for their money? This is fundamental to the financial health of Twitter,"" he wrote. After putting his offer on hold Mr Musk told a conference in Miami on Monday that ""you can't pay the same price for something that is much worse than they claimed"". He said that a deal is ""not out of the question"" at a different price but added: ""The more questions I ask, the more my concerns grow."" Twitter has said it is committed to completing the deal at the agreed price.  In a filing with regulators on Tuesday, it told shareholders that Mr Musk's apparent eagerness to get the deal done, even without ordinary research into the business, set him apart from any other potential suitors. ""Other potential [buyers] would require substantial due diligence, creating a delay and risk to reaching the signing of such a potential transaction,"" it said. Mr Musk has called for tests of random samples of Twitter users to identify bots. He said ""there is some chance it might be over 90% of daily active users"". Researchers have estimated that anywhere from 4% to 20% or more of the millions of Twitter profiles are fake. Twitter shares on Monday closed more than 8% down at $37.39, sowing doubts that Mr Musk would go ahead with his acquisition at the agreed price. Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that it ""looks increasingly likely that Elon Musk is positioning to renegotiate a sharply lower price tag for Twitter or even try and pull the pin on the deal"". She said that establishing the number of real users on Twitter is considered ""vital to future revenue streams via advertising or paid for subscriptions on the site"". ""The volatility which has hit tech stocks and contributed to a sharp decline in Twitter's valuation is also highly likely to be part of the equation,"" Ms Streeter said, adding that Mr Musk is ""clearly rueing the timing of his rash offer to pay $44bn for the social network""."
Volatility,US spies peer into the future - and it's not rosy,2024-09-25,2021-04-08,By Gordon Corera,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-56683852,"The US Intelligence Community has issued a survey of where the world may end up in 2040. It warns of a political volatility and growing international competition or even conflict.  The report entitled A More Contested World is an attempt to look at key trends and outlines a series of possible scenarios. It is the seventh such report with one coming every four years since 1997 from the National Intelligence Council. The Global Trends 2040 report does not make comfortable reading if you are a political leader or international diplomat - or hope to be one in the coming years. The latest attempt by the US National Intelligence Council to understand what may happen within and between countries points to uncertainty and instability. It firstly focuses on the key factors driving change. One is political volatility. ""In many countries, people are pessimistic about the future and growing more distrustful of leaders and institutions that they see as unable or unwilling to deal with disruptive economic, technological, and demographic trends,"" the report warns.  Vulnerable democracies It argues people are gravitating to like-minded groups and making greater and more varied demands of governments at a time when those governments are increasingly constrained in what they can do.  ""This mismatch between governments' abilities and publics' expectations is likely to expand and lead to more political volatility, including growing polarisation and populism within political systems, waves of activism and protest movements, and, in the most extreme cases, violence, internal conflict, or even state collapse."" Unmet expectations, fuelled by social media and technology, could lead to risks for democracy.  ""Looking forward, many democracies are likely to be vulnerable to further erosion and even collapse,"" the report warns, although adding that these pressures will also affect authoritarian regimes. Pandemic a massive 'global disruption' The report says the current pandemic is the ""most significant, singular global disruption since World War II"", which has fuelled divisions, accelerated existing changes and challenged assumptions, including over how well governments can cope. The last report in 2017 included such a possibility - imagining that ""the global pandemic of 2023"" dramatically reduced global travel to contain its spread.   The authors acknowledge they did not expect Covid-19, which they say has ""shaken long-held assumptions about resilience and adaptation and created new uncertainties about the economy, governance, geopolitics, and technology"".  Climate change and demographic shifts will also be key drivers, as will be technology, which could prove disruptive but also empower those who harness it fastest and first. Geopolitical competition Internationally, the analysts expects the intensity of competition for global influence to reach its highest level since the Cold War over the coming two decades amid the continuing weakening of the old order as institutions like the United Nations struggle.  Non-governmental organisations, including religious groups and what are called ""technology superstar firms"" may also have the ability to build networks that compete with - or even - bypass states. The risk of conflict may increase, with it becoming harder to deter new weapons being used.  Jihadist terrorism is likely to continue but there is a warning that extreme right- and left-wing terrorists promoting issues such as racism, environmentalism and anti-government extremism could revive in Europe, Latin America and North America.  Groups could use artificial intelligence to become more dangerous or use augmented reality to create ""virtual terrorist training camps"". The competition between the US and China lies at the heart of many of the differences in the scenarios - whether one of them becomes more successful or whether the two compete equally or divide the world into separate silos. Read more by Gordon Corera A 2004 report also predicted a caliphate emerging out of the Middle East, much as the Islamic State group tried to create in the last decade, although the same report - looking ahead to 2020 - did not quite capture the competition with China which now dominates US security thinking.  The overall aim is to look at possible futures rather than predict with certainty. Stronger democracies or 'the world adrift'? There are some optimistic scenarios for 2040 - one called ""the renaissance of democracies"".  This involves the US and its allies harnessing technology and economic growth to deal with domestic and international challenges, while China and Russia's crackdowns (including in Hong Kong) stifle innovation and strengthen the appeal of democracy.  But others are bleaker.   ""The world adrift scenario"" imagines market economies never recovering from the Covid pandemic, becoming domestically deeply divided and living in an international system that is ""directionless, chaotic and volatile"" as international rules and institutions are ignored by countries, corporations and other groups. One scenario, though, does manage to combine pessimism with optimism.  ""Tragedy and Mobilisation"" imagines a world in the midst of a global catastrophe in the early 2030s thanks to climate change, famine and unrest - but this in turn leads to a new global coalition, driven in part by social movements, to address the problems. Of course, none of the scenarios may come to pass or - more likely - a combination or something entirely novel may emerge. The aim, the authors say, is to prepare for an array of possible futures - even if many of them look far from rosy."
Volatility,Lessons must be learned from A6 delays - Campbell,2024-09-25,2023-04-04,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-65172930,"Lessons must be learned from the delays to the long-awaited A6 road upgrade, DUP MP Gregory Campbell has said.  The 16-mile (25.5km) stretch of road between Londonderry and Dungiven will open on Thursday. Work started in 2018 but has been beset by continual delays.  Mr Campbell also reiterated his calls for a public inquiry into the project.   The Department for Infrastructure's (DfI) Kaine Lynch said the project had to be delivered ""in extremely challenging circumstances"". He added there were many factors as to why there had been delays to the road opening, citing the Covid-19 pandemic, the increased costs of building materials and some materials being in short supply. Starting at the village of Drumahoe, the 16-mile section of dual carriageway will include a bypass around Dungiven. The road opened with speed limits and lane restrictions for a short period in summer 2022, but then later closed again as work continued. Speaking to BBC Radio Foyle's Breakfast Show, Mr Campbell said it was ""exceptionally good news"" that the project will be open before the Easter break.  ""It is great news but we should have had more information throughout - this was due to be finished more than a year ago,"" the East Londonderry MP said.   Mr Campbell said a public inquiry should happen, but added ""what is probably more important now is that the lessons of the delay over the past 18 months need to be learned for any future projects"". In Dungiven, local people welcomed the news.  Sheila McCartney from local clothing and giftware shop Nora & Katie said there was ""huge potential"" for businesses and tourism. ""We're just really looking forward to a nicer, less polluted, quieter Dungiven,"" she said. Local butcher Dessie McAleese said he was looking forward to the road's opening on Thursday. ""It's brilliant for the town because it is very congested, especially at the weekends, and the parking facilities are terrible."" Kaine Lynch said the DfI was ""delivering the largest road infrastructure project ever in Northern Ireland. ""We experienced the war in Ukraine, Covid-19, material shortages and supply chain issues.""   Mr Lynch said that in terms of scale of the project, they had more than 600 people working on the site in peak periods, have excavated enough material to fill Wembley Stadium in London and planted close to 750,000 trees. He conceded that ""people have waited a long time for this road"" but said that he is delighted that road users will be able to reap the benefits of it from Thursday.  Mr Lynch said 15,000 vehicles use the route each day and it will reduce journey time from Drumahoe to Dungiven by about 45% and be a ""significant benefit"" to improving road safety. The DfI had previously said the initial estimate of £220m was now likely to be in the region of £250m.  ""That is in the region of 12% over where we originally estimated,"" Mr Lynch said.  ""I know £30m is a lot of money, but given the scale of the project and the scale of the challenges that we faced I think that is a pretty good outcome."""
Volatility,Warning over fuel prices as oil hits 10-month high,2024-09-25,2023-09-19,By Michael Race,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-66852329,"Drivers have been warned of rising fuel costs after global oil prices surged to their highest level for 10 months. Brent crude, a benchmark for prices, breached $95 a barrel on Tuesday amid predictions of shorter supplies. It came as the International Energy Agency (IEA) said a decision by Saudi Arabia and Russia to cut production could cause a ""significant supply shortfall"" by the end of this year. The RAC motoring group warned drivers were ""in for a hard time"" at the pumps. Latest figures show UK drivers are now paying £1.55 on average per litre of petrol, with diesel at £1.59.  Since the start of August, average petrol prices have increased by 10p per litre and diesel prices by 13p. Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, oil prices soared, hitting more than $120 a barrel in June last year. They fell back to a little above $70 a barrel in May this year, but have steadily risen since then as producers have tried to restrict output to support the market. Saudi Arabia and Russia, members of the Opec+ group and two of the world's largest oil-producing nations, decided to reduce production earlier in August. At the same time, the US Energy Information Administration said on Monday that US oil output from its top shale-producing regions was set to decline in October for the third straight month, reaching its lowest level since May.  As the biggest exporter and the leader of the pack, Saudi Arabia wants oil prices to stay elevated to make sure it has a steady stream of income while it tries to diversify its economy. However, the West has accused Opec, whose members regularly meet to agree on production levels, of manipulating prices. Petrol and diesel prices have jumped in recent months, and further rises could lie ahead due to crude oil being the main component of fuel, motoring groups say.  The AA warned rising prices were coming at a time when fuel efficiency typically drops as a result of darker evenings due to engines needing to work harder with heaters and lights being used more. ""Drivers have been lashed by a 10p-a-litre rise in the cost of petrol since the beginning of August,"" said Luke Bodset, the AA's spokesman on pump prices. ""The only things in their favour have been daylight still in the rush hour and mild weather, which means less fuel consumption. The drivers now beginning to feel happier are those with electric cars."" RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said with oil heading back towards $100 a barrel, drivers were ""in for a hard time at the pumps"", but he added that a rise to three figures ""should really only take the average price up by another 2p"". But he warned: ""If retailers are intent on making more money per litre with increased margins then this could [take the average petrol price] closer to 160p."" Analysts warn rising global oil prices could impact inflation - the rate at which prices rise - in many countries. Inflation soared in 2022 and has only recently started to come down. ""The symbolically important $100 [a barrel of oil] mark is now being considered once more,"" said Sophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown. ""This is a difficult development, with fuel accounting for a significant portion of overall inflation."" The latest inflation figure for the UK will be released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) on Wednesday. Inflation has fallen in recent months but remains high at 6.8%. Over the last few years households have been hit by higher fuel and energy bills, while businesses have put up prices to cope with rising costs. A recent fall in the pound may have made fuel even more expensive. As well as supply and demand, oil prices are also affected by the exchange rate between the pound and dollar, as Brent crude is traded in dollars.  Saudi Arabia's Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman defended Opec+'s moves to restrict supply on Monday, saying energy markets needed light-handed regulation to limit volatility."
Volatility,Can India's Adani Group recover from $100bn loss?,2024-09-25,2023-02-07,By Archana Shukla,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-64495573,"India's Adani Group has seen its market value plunge after a US investment firm made fraud allegations against it. Can its ambitious growth plans survive?  Until two weeks ago, the ports-to-energy conglomerate which operates seven publicly traded companies had a combined valuation of $220bn.  But since 24 January, when short seller Hindenburg Research accused the group of ""brazen"" stock manipulation and accounting fraud, its valuations have nearly halved. The group's founder Gautam Adani has seen billions wiped off his personal wealth and has dropped out of the list of the world's top 20 richest people. The Adani Group has denied the allegations, calling them ""malicious"" and ""baseless"" and says it plans have not changed. But investors are clearly still nervous.  On Monday, the group said in a statement that it would prepay loans worth $1.1bn, taken using shares as collateral, ahead of their maturity date next year. This, it said, was partly due to ""continued market volatility"" and to assure investors that the group's promoters would ""prepay all shares-backed financing"". The announcement led to a rally in the flagship company's stock - on Tuesday, shares of Adani Enterprises closed 15% higher on the Bombay Stock Exchange. Last week, the group also called off its secondary share sale. The 2.5bn (£2bn) it had raised was meant to pay off debt and fund projects, including airport renovation, expressway construction and an ambitious green hydrogen ecosystem. They indicate investors are losing confidence in a company. Analysts are now watching to see how the stock price slide affects the company's operations, cash flow and expansion plans. ""Most of their ambitious projects will have to be heavily scaled back in ambition and timetable, because they will have next to no capacity to raise funds right now,"" says Tim Buckley, director at Climate Energy Finance, a think-tank that works on financial issues related to transition from fossil fuel to clean energy. It could borrow money to fund projects and acquisitions - a common strategy for infrastructure companies, which helped fuel the Adani Group's rapid growth. But the group's debt has grown at a faster pace than revenues and profitability, which some fear could raise risks of a default - a concern flagged by both the Hindenburg report as well as some analysts. The group already has total debt of nearly two trillion rupees ($24bn; £20bn) - it almost doubled over the past three years as Mr Adani's ambitions extended to areas such as 5G and green hydrogen. Nearly two-thirds of Adani's debt is from overseas sources such as bonds or foreign banks, according to a report by global brokerage Jefferies. Until now, the group has mostly raised funds by using its infrastructure assets or shares as collateral. But with stock prices plunging, the value of this collateral has also dipped. The private wealth units of two big banks, Credit Suisse and Citigroup, have stopped accepting Adani bonds as collateral, Bloomberg has reported.  Many Indian banks have also loaned billions of dollars to companies linked to the group and state-owned insurance firm Life Insurance Corporation of India has invested in it. Market observers say that the Hindenburg report and the reaction to it will make lenders cautious - which means loans could become costlier. ""There is pressure on the company's credibility. It will make it extremely difficult to raise fresh loans, especially in the overseas market,"" an Indian corporate banker said on condition of anonymity as he didn't want to be seen commenting on the Adani Group. Another observer, a former banker with an international wealth fund, said that the group may be forced to delay some projects until the issue settles down. He also did not want to be named. The BBC sent a list of questions to the Adani Group. A spokesperson replied: ""All our ongoing projects continue according to the plan. Adani Group's core fundamentals remain unchanged.""  Scrutiny on the group has now increased. Investors and credit rating agencies are closely assessing its ability to raise money and repay loans. S&P Global Ratings has downgraded its outlook on two Adani companies to negative. ""New investigations and negative market sentiment may lead to increased cost of capital and reduce funding access for rated entities,"" it said.   In a video statement after the group's share sale was called off, Mr Adani had said that its balance sheet was ""healthy and assets robust"". He added that the group has an ""impeccable track record of fulfilling our debt obligations"". But credit rating agency ICRA said in a statement last week that the group's large, debt-funded capital spending programme remains a key challenge. Most of the group's capital-guzzling new businesses such as green energy, airports and roads are housed under flagship company Adani Enterprises Ltd (AEL) and depend on it for funds. AEL has enough cash but could come under pressure if it has to pay interest for even its subsidiaries. Some of the group's firms will be shielded from the current volatility because they own and operate strong physical assets such as ports, airports and factories. ""Adani Ports and Adani Power are the strongest and most well-capitalised [firms], which means their assets are backed by long-term government contracts. Most of the loans taken by these companies are against these revenue and profit-accruing assets,"" says the corporate banker quoted above. However, this isn't the case for some of the group's newer businesses. Companies such as Adani Gas and renewable energy arm Adani Green already have immense debt on their books and are still building up their cash flows. This could make them more vulnerable to market shocks and reduce their creditworthiness. The banker points out that while the prices of bonds issued by Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd have fallen only marginally, those issued by Adani Green had lost more than a quarter of their value in three days. Deferring new projects and selling some assets to raise money could be a way out. ICRA has said that some of the planned capital spending is discretionary in nature and can be deferred, depending on how much liquidity it has. ""The company has built assets that are valuable to a developing country like India, and there will be many strategic investors interested,"" said a corporate adviser who didn't want to be named. Some analysts remain optimistic. ""I have seen varied operating [Adani] projects from ports, airports, cements to renewables which are solid, stable and generating a healthy cash flow. They are completely safe from the ups and downs of what happens in the stock market,"" says Vinayak Chatterjee, an infrastructure expert who is founder and managing trustee of the Infravision Foundation.  Analysts are also watching to see if there will be a regulatory enquiry into the group's corporate governance. The issue has also set off a political row over Mr Adani's perceived closeness to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which both deny.  On Tuesday, Rahul Gandhi from the main opposition Congress party brought up the allegations in parliament, accusing Mr Modi of helping the Adani Group - his comments caused uproar, with a federal minister accusing Mr Gandhi of levelling ""wild allegations"" without proof.    A day earlier, the party had held protests across the country, demanding an investigation into the allegations. Mr Buckley says that as pressure mounts, the Adani Group's ability to win government contracts easily to ramp up revenues will be challenged. It will also find it difficult to restore its credit credibility.  Since the group has to repay a significant amount, it will have to do a strategic asset sale, he says. "
Volatility,Electricity bills to rise after increase approved,2024-09-25,2023-05-26,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-guernsey-65707754,"Bills are set to rise after the States allowed Guernsey Electricity to increase its revenues by 13%. The States' Trading Supervisory Board (STSB) said the increase would be split between the charge per unit and the daily fixed standing charge. The rise is below the 14.25% increase the company requested. STSB President, Deputy Peter Roffey, said the increase was ""regrettable but unavoidable"". The additional revenue will fund ""essential investment in the island's electricity infrastructure and offset the escalating cost of electricity import and generation arising from the market volatility caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine"", the States said. In the past 12 months, those costs incurred by the company have increased by £3.3m above what had been forecast in 2022, it added. Karl Brouard, Guernsey Electricity's chief financial officer, said: ""For the average usage customer on the standard or economy tariffs, both without electric heating, the combined impact of these changes is a rise of around £200 per year per household. ""We understand that this comes at a time when the cost of living is increasing for everyone, but we cannot delay much needed investment and upgrading of the network, along with the requirement to maintain the security of electricity supply to the island."" Deputy Roffey said: ""It is regrettable that Guernsey Electricity had to apply for such a significant increase in tariffs, but this is a nettle that had to be grasped."" He said ""a rise is unavoidable. We recognise the timing is bad, but to put it off could simply store up even greater challenges in the years ahead"". In deciding on a lower increase than the company had requested, the STSB said it had considered the impact on consumers ""in particular during the current economic climate"". ""The STSB has therefore acted responsibly in approving an increase, although not to the level that Guernsey Electricity had requested, which will require the company to continue focusing on improving efficiency,"" he said. The STSB also took independent advice and considered the results of a public consultation. Electricity bills will increase from 1 July. Follow BBC Guernsey on Twitter and Facebook.

Volatility,US shares hit as virus surge revives economic fears,2024-09-25,2020-06-24,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-53172713,"Financial markets in the US dropped more than 2% on Wednesday as a rise in coronavirus cases raised the prospect of another round of lockdown measures. New York and two nearby states announced a quarantine on visitors from some US hotspots, while Europe was said to be considering a ban on US visitors. The new rules revived concerns about the path of America's fledgling economic recovery. Shares in travel, retail and energy firms were among the hardest hit. Cruise lines Carnival, Royal Caribbean and Norwegian tumbled more than 11%, while retailer Gap and shopping mall owner Simon Property Group fell more than 7%. Energy firms, already grappling with a drop in demand for oil, also slumped, with giants Exxon and Chevron both down more than 4%. Disney, which has seen its parks closed, cruises cancelled and filming disrupted due to the pandemic, tumbled 3.9%.   The firm is preparing to re-open all of its parks by mid-July, including its properties in Florida and California. But a labour union representing about 17,000 Disney workers has called for a protest in California, warning that returning to work is not yet safe. In Florida, one of the virus hotspots, more than 7,000 people have signed an online petition surging the company and local officials to reconsider the re-opening plans. ""It is clear that theme parks - a non-essential business - should not be planning to operate until the cases have gone down again,"" the petition says. On Sunday, the new daily coronavirus cases reported in Florida were quadruple the amount reported when the state began reopening on 4 May.  Top health advisor Dr Anthony Fauci said many US states including Florida are seeing a ""disturbing surge"" in cases on Tuesday.  Earlier, European markets also closed lower, with London's FTSE 100 down about 3%, while indexes in Germany and France posted similar declines. The falls came as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said the global economy would shrink 4.9% this year, substantially worse than the 3% it forecast as recently as April. The organisation said it expected US output to contract 8% - 2 percentage points worse than it predicted in April - while the UK would shrink roughly 10%. The gloomy outlook diverges with the optimism seen in financial markets in recent months, which has propelled the tech-heavy Nasdaq index to new highs and left the S&P 500 and Dow less than 15% lower than their February records. On Wednesday, the Dow dropped 709 points or 2.7% to close at 25,447. The S&P 500 fell 2.5% or 80.8 points, to close at 3,050.4 and the Nasdaq fell 2.1% or 222.2 points to close at 9,909.1. Sharp swings in share prices will remain common until questions about how to handle the virus are resolved, Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at US Bank Wealth Management, recently wrote in a note. ""The path toward normalcy will require more time and is subject to much uncertainty,"" he wrote.  ""We expect volatility to remain elevated from historical levels until coronavirus treatment and prevention solutions become available, presumably in early 2021."""
Volatility,FTSE 100 suffers worst year since financial crisis,2024-09-25,2020-12-31,By Simon Read,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-55500103,"Pension savers and investors' nest-eggs have been hit as the UK's leading share index had its worst year since the height of the financial crisis. The FTSE 100 index fell 14.3% over the year, marking its worst performance since 2008, when it slumped 31.3%. Despite the poor performance, the blue-chip index has recovered significantly since the start of the global pandemic when it was a third lower than now. Analysts have said that next year is likely to be better for investors. ""The factors which worked against the FTSE-100 in 2020 - the pandemic, a deep recession and Brexit - will start to fade into the background, giving corporate profits, dividends and employment a chance to bounce back,"" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. Such market volatility can be alarming, but people should not panic. Anyone who sold shares back in March would have missed out on the market's gains we've seen since, for instance. Market movements don't only affect savers with shares or funds that invest in the stock market. They also affect anyone with a pension scheme, as the money we stash for our retirement is invested on our behalf in the market. That means millions of workers in the UK are relaying on stock market returns for their financial future. Seasoned investors and fund managers are constantly taking action to protect their portfolio. That can mean moving cash out of risky markets or moving into safer cash havens, such as bonds. It's essential to diversify and not back just one investment opportunity, which is what funds are all about. By avoiding having all your savings in one basket - or share - then you avoid falling prey to the worst volatility of stock markets. ""The coronavirus market downturn spurred many young people to dip a toe into the world of investments for the first time - perhaps because they have been at home more,"" pointed out Myron Jobson, personal finance campaigner at Interactive Investor. ""The key for investors of all ages is to ensure that your portfolio is well diversified across assets, sectors and regions so that you are not overexposed to risk in any one part of the market."" ""If 2020 taught us anything it's that predicting short-term movements in the stock market is impossible,"" Robin Powell, editor of The Evidence-Based Investor told the BBC. ""Investors should check that they're happy with the level of risk they're taking, and if they are, they should ignore the noise and stay invested, rebalancing periodically."" He advises people to have a portfolio you can stick with through thick and thin, diversified across regions and sector, and that includes a percentage of government bonds to dampen the risk. ""And don't pay for help from anyone who thinks they know where markets are heading. They have no more of a clue than you do,"" he cautioned. Mr Mould conceded that it has been hard to find a decent return in 2020 with interest rate cuts, falling returns from National Savings products and lower Government bond yields. But if you put your money overseas, the story could have been different. ""Japanese and US stock markets both had solid years and America's tech-laden Nasdaq soared by over 40%,"" he pointed out. That's a point taken up by Michael Baxter, economics commentator for The Share Centre. ""Compare the FTSE-100 with the US equivalent,"" he said. ""The S&P 500 surged this year hitting a new all-time high. By contrast, the FTSE 100 fell sharply."" He attributes that to the tech sector making up a high proportion of the US index. ""The COVID-19 crisis has accelerated a trend that was already in place before, namely the adoption of digital.  ""By contrast, the FTSE 100 is made up too many companies with their base stuck in the past, trying to promote 20th century business models in the 21st century and Covid just served to make a bad situation worse."""
Volatility,US job growth surges in February,2024-09-25,2018-03-09,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-43345362,"Job creation in the US economy surged last month, but the annual rate of wage growth slowed. The economy created 313,000 jobs in February, official figures show, far in excess of analysts' expectations. However, the unemployment rate remained at 4.1%, while the annual earnings growth rate slowed to 2.6% last month. January's annual wage growth rate - which had triggered fears over inflationary pressures - was also revised down from 2.9% to 2.8%. The strong wage growth figure for January prompted sharp volatility on the stock market, as investors worried the US Federal Reserve would quicken the pace at which it increased interest rates. Despite a lower-than-expected wage increase in February, many economists said longer term trends still point to higher wages. The US economy is in its ninth year of economic expansion, with an upswing in global growth and tax cuts passed last year helping to boost growth. Friday's report from the US Labor Department showed the biggest increase in jobs since July 2016, sending major stock indexes higher. The three major US stock indexes climbed almost 2% by the close of trading and the Nasdaq closed at a record high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 440 points, or 1.77%, to end at 25,335, the S&P 500 gained 47 points, or 1.74%, to 2,786 and the Nasdaq ended up 132 points, or 1.79%, to 7,560. ""We have an economy that is firing on all cylinders and the job market is a reflection of that,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Bank. February's gains included an increase of 61,000 construction jobs - the biggest rise since 2007. The manufacturing sector also added 31,000 jobs, while retail employment rebounded from declines last year. The number of people working or looking for work also jumped by more than 800,000 last month. That was the biggest monthly rise in the labour force in more than two decades and boosted the labour force participation rate to 63%. Despite the rise, the unemployment rate held steady at 4.1%, where it has hovered since October.   Those figures provided fodder for analysts who say wage growth could be moderated by a large number of potential workers sitting on the sidelines. ""The huge gain in payrolls belies the notion that the [labour] market has truly reached full employment,"" said Sophia Koropeckyj of Moody's Analytics. Increasing participation by men of prime working age - between 25 and 54 years - has helped drive the labour force participation rate higher in recent months, reflecting a resurgence in sectors such as manufacturing. But Ms Koropeckyj said she does not expect the labour force to continue growing at last month's pace, pointing to challenges such as skill gaps and opioid addiction.  Americans are also moving less, fuelling a geographic mismatch between jobs and job seekers and hardening regional disparities.  ""There's only so much of a boost you can get because a lot of people are structurally unemployed,"" she said. ""Certainly there is slack, but how much of it will be practically absorbed is questionable."" Ms Koropeckyj said a tighter labour market makes slow acceleration in wage growth ""inevitable"" this year.  The average hourly wage for private sector workers was $26.75 last month, up 68 cents from February 2017 and 4 cents from January. Markets are expecting the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at least three times in 2018. But with the inflation rate lagging its target 2% rate, it has been waiting for signs - like strong wage growth - of pricing pressure. Analysts said strong hiring in February all but guarantees the Fed will raise rates at its meeting later this month, even if the figures were boosted by mild weather. But the relatively weak wage growth did little to resolve debates about whether policymakers will eventually move faster."
Volatility,New GCSEs 'hardest since O-levels',2024-09-25,2017-08-22,By Sean Coughlan,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-41000575,"The new-style GCSE exams in England are the most difficult since the end of O-levels in the 1980s, according to an independent school leader. The first results of revised GCSEs in English and maths will be published this week, with a grading system using numbers from 9 to 1. Barnaby Lenon, chairman of the Independent Schools Council, says they will stretch the most able students. But he urges universities to be cautious about using the top grade 9. ""Universities should not consider the distinction between an 8 and a 9 worth making until they have evidence that it does indicate something,"" Mr Lenon writes in an article to be published later this week. ""After all, 95% might get you a grade 8, 96-to-100% a grade 9. Does the grade 9 student have greater intellectual ability and academic potential or are they simply better at writing fast, or better at checking for silly errors?  ""Only time, and analysis of results, will tell."" The new-style exams, beginning with English and maths, will no longer use coursework or modules, but will be graded on final exams. Mr Lenon predicted that schools that had relied on coursework to boost results could ""suffer a fall in grades this year"". He argues that coursework was an ""unreliable measure"" of ability, ""much of it had little value"" and it could too easily be ""influenced"" by teachers or parents. There will also be changes to the syllabuses to make them more demanding. While much of the attention will be on the new grading system, Mr Lenon says it is important not to miss the scale of change for the qualification. ""They contain questions of a level of difficulty that we have not seen since the abolition of O-levels in 1987,"" says Mr Lenon. This is intended to stretch pupils in England so that they can catch up with the standards of pupils in east Asia, he says. But if the new exams provide more challenge for the most gifted pupils, he says the impact at the average and lower ability end remains uncertain. ""Raising the bar"" will not necessarily help these pupils, he says, unless they have the support to ""jump higher"". ""It is the quality of teaching of less able or less diligent pupils that will help them to succeed in their GCSEs."" Head teachers' leader Geoff Barton said that schools would be concerned about ""volatility"" in the results of individual schools, below the surface of national results. Mr Barton, head of the ASCL head-teachers' union, said there should be caution about interpreting and comparing the results of such a different form of GCSE. Teachers and pupils would have to adjust to a different style of qualification, he said, and he warned against people ""springing to judgement"" over unanticipated results. John Blake, head of education at the Policy Exchange think tank, backed the changes. ""These new GCSEs are demanding, and rightly so,"" said Mr Blake.  ""The comparison with O-level is a good one - those qualifications were designed for our most academic children, and as we improve our curriculum and our expectations of all our young people, it is right they be the benchmark for success."" GCSE results are to be published on Thursday - including the first wave of new 9-to-1 grades. There have been warnings of confusion over numerical grading and questions about a system that will have two different types of pass grade - with grade 4 a ""standard"" pass and grade 5 a ""strong"" pass. The Institute of Directors warned last week that some employers might not understand the new grades and would see them as ""gibberish""."
Volatility,Regulator warns North Sea emissions could rise,2024-09-25,2022-09-20,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-62973842,"Production emissions from oil and gas facilities in the North Sea fell last year but are expected to rise again, according to regulators. Figures from the North Sea Transition Authority (NSTA) show total emissions were 14.6% lower than 2020 levels. But it warned that without further investment the industry would miss its target to halve emissions by 2030. The industry insisted it had made ""good progress"" and was another step closer to reaching its net zero goals. Greenhouse gases from extracting oil and gas account for about 4% of the UK's total, which is about the same as a third of all Scotland's emissions. But because energy is reserved, production from Scotland's waters is not counted in its annual audit. The NSTA report attributed the latest fall in emissions to a combination of industry efforts, Covid disruption and an overall drop in production for delayed maintenance. Almost three-quarters of those emissions come from generating power to run the installations, with gas flaring accounting for a further 22%. The report said it would be a ""challenge"" to sustain the emissions reductions in future years as operations return to a more regular pattern. But NSTA chief executive Dr Andy Samuel insisted the industry would be held to account to make sure it delivers on its targets. He added: ""The industry has made impressive progress on reducing emissions during a turbulent period marked by a global pandemic and unprecedented price volatility. ""Energy security is more sharply in focus than ever and the NSTA is working closely with industry and government to bring new oil and gas projects online and bolster UK energy supply. This vital work sits alongside emissions reduction goals."" Reducing production emissions is a key commitment as part of the industry's North Sea transition deal with the government. Although there's been some initial progress, sustaining that will be difficult. The figures have been helped by the decommissioning of some older, more polluting, platforms like Thistle Alpha in the northern North Sea. It's further hoped that some assets can be powered by renewable electricity - rather than gas - within five years. But the energy security crisis sparked by the war in Ukraine means the North Sea is now running at near full capacity. And that means more emissions which will undoubtedly show up in these figures next year. Total emissions for the UK oil and gas sector have fallen by 21.5% since the industry's benchmark year of 2018. Despite the overall fall, the average emissions from produced oil has increased to the equivalent of 25.4kg of carbon dioxide per barrel. This figure is called the ""carbon intensity"" of the sector. The report says the UK is slightly higher than the median global average.  Ryan Morrison, from Friends of the Earth Scotland, said: ""The irony should not be lost on anyone that as the fossil fuel industry thinks about attaching wind turbines to oil platforms, they are also pushing to drill every last drop of oil and gas.  ""Worse still, this report shows that the pollution from each barrel is higher than the majority of other countries and has actually increased in the last year. ""Both climate science and energy experts are crystal clear that there can be no new oil or gas developments if we want to stay within the agreed limits of global temperature rises, no matter how much the industry tinkers around the edges of North Sea emissions."" Will Webster, from industry body OEUK, added: ""Oil and gas will be needed for decades to come, so it's important that we meet as much of our own demand as possible in the most sustainable way we can. ""The NSTA's report shows industry has made good progress on the emissions reduction targets set out in the North Sea Transition Deal, marking another step closer to reaching our net zero goals."""
Volatility,Job losses at Mini plant postponed,2024-09-25,2020-09-10,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-oxfordshire-54108246,"Hundreds of proposed job losses at the Mini car factory in Oxford have been postponed.  BMW, which owns the plant in Cowley, said in August that 400 of 950 agency staff would be going. But it said they would now be kept on after ""recent and unexpected improvements in global customer demand"".  Production at the factory was halted in March because of the coronavirus pandemic, with work resuming in May. Last month it was announced the plant would move from a three-shift pattern to running two shifts by mid-October. It would have still operated five days a week.  But the three-shift pattern will be maintained for the time being ""in light of higher-than-expected order volumes"", a spokesman said.  He added: ""We remain in close dialogue with trade union representatives and are keeping our workforce, including agency employees, fully informed of any developments during this uncertain and unpredictable time. ""The continuing market volatility posed by the Covid-19 pandemic means that we cannot say whether, or for how long, positive market trends will continue, and we will of course be keeping the situation under close review in the weeks and months ahead."""
Volatility,Future of US bank in doubt as investors flee,2024-09-25,2023-04-26,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-65403307,"Shares in First Republic have tumbled nearly 30% to close at a new record low amid renewed fears the US bank could be the next to collapse. The sell-off extended steep declines from a day earlier after the bank said customers had pulled $100bn in deposits from the bank in March. First Republic has been under pressure since a series of US bank failures last month sparked fears of a wider crisis. Its shares have shed 95% of their value in a matter of weeks. Shares ended Wednesday trading at less than $6 each, compared with more than $120 at the start of March. Founded in San Francisco in 1985, the bank is known for having a big mortgage lending business and a large stable of wealthy clients, many of whom had saved more money with the bank than would be guaranteed by the government. It was seen as vulnerable to a bank run - and being squeezed by higher interest rates, as it is forced to pay more to keep deposits, while earning less on the home loans made when rates were lower.  Last month it received a $30bn influx from some of America's biggest banks, a rescue plan aimed at shoring up confidence in the lender, which had seemed to calm fears. But the scale of the withdrawals revealed this week was even worse than investors had expected.  On Wednesday, the stock swung sharply and trading was repeatedly halted amid the volatility.  The bank - which was the 14th largest in America at the end of 2022 - has said it is exploring its options.  US media outlets have reported it is trying to convince the banks that supported it before to buy more of its assets to help prop up the business. They also say regulators are on alert but not prepared to step in yet. ""There can be no certainty that the bank will be able to take actions to strengthen our business within a time frame that is acceptable to the market or our regulators,"" the bank said on Monday.  ""There can be no certainty as to the future of the bank if we are not able to do so."" Problems in the banking sector surfaced in the US earlier last month when Silicon Valley Bank, which was the country's 16th-largest lender, collapsed in the biggest failure of a US bank since 2008. That was followed two days later by the failure of New York's Signature Bank. Authorities stepped in to guarantee deposits beyond typical limits in an effort to head off further runs on bank deposits. But the move, which the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp has estimated cost roughly $20bn, did not immediately prevent concerns from spreading.  In Europe, Swiss officials also brokered a rescue for troubled banking giant Credit Suisse, which saw 61.2bn Swiss francs ($69bn; £55.2bn) leave the bank in the first three months of the year.  Central banks around the world - including the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England - have sharply increased interest rates as they try to curb inflation. The moves have hurt the values of the large portfolios of bonds bought by banks when rates were lower.  Customers worried about the financial implications for Silicon Valley Bank abruptly pulled funds from their accounts, leading to its collapse. The episode also raised fears about the situation at other firms."
Volatility,Energy firms face stricter tests after collapses,2024-09-25,2021-12-15,By Kevin Peachey,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-59664188,"Energy companies will face more robust financial checks from January after a host of companies failed owing to a wholesale price surge, the regulator Ofgem has announced. Bosses of firms will also undergo more stringent vetting. More than 20, mostly small, suppliers have collapsed following a spike in wholesale gas prices. Nearly four million other households have seen their supplier fail since the start of the pandemic. The regulator also said it was consulting on the future set up of the energy price cap, designed to protect customers who have not switched. It has been highlighted as part of the problem by some failed companies.  ""I am setting out clear action so that we have robust stress testing for suppliers so they can't pass inappropriate risk to consumers,"" said Ofgem chief executive Jonathan Brearley.   ""Our priority has been, and will always be, to act in the best interests of energy consumers. The months ahead will be difficult for many, and we are working with the government and energy companies to mitigate the impact as much as we can, particularly for the most vulnerable households.""  A significant rise in bills for 15 million people is inevitable in April, but Ofgem is also consulting on possible changes to the way tariffs are offered in the longer-term. Options include customers being tied in to a standard tariff for six months, like a fixed term mortgage. If they left early for a cheaper deal, they would be charged an exit fee, unlike now. The argument is that suppliers and remaining customers would not be left picking up the cost of their departure, although exit fees would be controversial. Other suggestions include forcing companies to offer the same price to existing customers as they do to new customers. A similar rule is being introduced for home and motor insurance in January. There might also be a charge paid by a supplier each time it takes on a new customer.  The price cap may also be reviewed every three months, rather than the current six, or an interim price cap introduced if market conditions changed dramatically. When a host of energy companies collapsed, Ofgem was heavily criticised for having been asleep at the wheel, and unprepared for such a crisis. Citizens Advice, the official advocate for energy customers, recently published what it described as Ofgem's ""catalogue of errors"" in recent years, that was now ultimately leaving customers having to pick up a multi-million pound bill. That included an accusation that poor practice was rife, with many companies showing clear evidence of financial unsustainability, ""including firms run out of the owners' living rooms and kitchens"". These latest announcement by Ofgem will address some of those concerns. They include: The regulator is also consulting on whether to block firms from taking on new customers once they hit certain milestones - such as 50,000 and 200,000 accounts - until it is happy with their balance sheet strength. ""What we want to say to suppliers is either get some insurance, buy your energy ahead or have enough money in the bank to weather a storm like this,"" Mr Brearley told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Customers of collapsed firms now have to pay more for their energy, because their original tariff was not protected. Those on the price cap also saw prices rises in October. This has been a major factor in the rising cost of living, with inflation now rising at its fastest rate for a decade. Mr Brearley said that customers should brace themselves for a further significant rise in gas prices in April, when a new price cap is introduced. ""Where you have legitimate price increases and the increase in gas is legitimate then those costs need to be passed onto customers. I know that's really hard, but we do expect a significant rise in April,"" he said. He added that it was too early to give a figure and refuted that Ofgem had failed to take control of the market. ""Our job as a regulator is to make sure people pay a fair price for energy but no more than that,"" he said. Ofgem said the cap had saved consumers an estimated £1bn a year since its introduction.  However it said the current methodology, while protecting consumers from price spikes, exposed suppliers to risks that are harder to manage at times of high energy price volatility.  ""There is a risk that, if not tackled, this could lead to higher costs for consumers,"" the regulator said."
Volatility,'Modi's Kashmir move will fuel resentment',2024-09-25,2019-08-05,By Andrew Whitehead,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-49233608,"For many Kashmiris, the special status afforded to Jammu and Kashmir by Article 370 of the Indian constitution reflects the different means by which, and basis on which, the princely state became part of India in late 1947. It was the result of an accommodation all those years ago between the government of India's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, and Kashmir's political leaders. India's BJP-led government has now unilaterally torn up that special dispensation. It's the biggest change in Kashmir's constitutional status since the 1950s. In practical terms, it doesn't mean all that much. The provisions of Article 370 have been greatly diluted over the decades. Jammu and Kashmir has its own constitution and its own flag, but otherwise no greater autonomy than any other Indian state.  A provision linked to Article 370 prevents outsiders buying property in the state. If that measure is also rescinded, as seems to be Delhi's intention, this may prompt fears of demographic change in the Kashmir valley - though there is unlikely to be much immediate impact.  It's the symbolic importance of the Indian government's move that matters most.  In repeated election manifestos, the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has pledged to scrap Kashmir's special status. It says full integration with the rest of India would promote development, and insists that there's no reason to treat Jammu and Kashmir differently either because it has a Muslim majority or because it is claimed by Pakistan. Narendra Modi's emphatic election victory in May has made it possible for the BJP to act on key Hindu nationalist demands such as the rescinding of Kashmir's special status. The move will be enthusiastically welcomed by the party's rank-and-file. But the measures taken in the run-up to the announcement demonstrate Delhi's concern about how the news will be received in Kashmir. Additional Indian troops were sent there, tourists and Hindu pilgrims were told to leave, schools and colleges were ordered to close, the internet and mobile networks were largely cut off, restrictions were placed on freedom of movement and assembly, and several mainstream Kashmiri politicians were placed under what amounts to house arrest.  Alongside the rescinding of special status, the Indian government has announced that Jammu and Kashmir will no longer be a state but have the lesser status of a union territory - and the sparsely populated region of Ladakh will be split off to become a separate union territory. That will attract a great deal of support in Jammu and in Ladakh but will be deeply resented in the Kashmir Valley. India's most restless and disaffected region may well become still more volatile. "
Volatility,"NI economic output at 15-year high, Nisra says",2024-09-25,2022-07-07,By John Campbell,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-62078425,"The Northern Ireland economy continued to grow in the first quarter of 2022, official figures from Nisra suggest. Output was up by 0.4% compared to the final quarter of 2021 and by 7.8% compared to the same period a year ago. NI economic output is now at a 15-year high and just 0.1% below the record output level recorded in the middle of 2007. From late 2007, Northern Ireland experienced a housing crash which caused significant economic damage. Northern Ireland's performance in the first quarter was weaker than the UK average: UK GDP grew by 0.8% quarter-on-quarter and by 8.7% year-on-year. However, the NI Statistics and Research Agency (Nisra) says that over a three-year time period Northern Ireland has grown more strongly with output up by 4.8% compared to UK GDP growth of 1.3%. Nisra uses the three-year comparison in an attempt to mitigate the economic volatility arising from the pandemic. In recent months, Northern Ireland's economic data has become intensely political as supporters and opponents of the NI Protocol attempt to construct economic arguments to support their positions. However, the data is inconclusive with Northern Ireland doing better than the UK average on some metrics and worse on others. In the first quarter of the year, growth in Northern Ireland was largely driven by the service sector which had a positive contribution of 0.4 percentage points (pps). The Public Sector and Production/manufacturing sector also had positive contributions with 0.2 pps and 0.1 pps. However, the Construction sector had a negative contribution of 0.3 pps; construction has faced some of the biggest problems with cost inflation and supply chain delays."

The Milford Haven Port Authority plans to add new hotels, shops and restaurants as well as up to 190 flats. It estimates that the new additions to the Milford Waterfront will create 610 new full-time jobs in the area. The council's planning committee granted planning permission as long as certain conditions are met. The port of Milford Haven currently handles about 20% of Britain's seaborne oil and gas trade, and already supports more than 4,000 jobs. It is estimated that the new redevelopment will also bring an additional £9 million a year in visitor spending to the local economy. Construction work has already begun on a new coffee house drive-through at the waterfront.

Volatility,Why West Africa wants a single currency,2024-09-25,2019-07-06,By Louise Dewast,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-48882030,"Fifteen countries in West Africa have agreed to adopt a single currency next year called the eco. Experts are divided on the impact it would have on the region's economy, especially in the eight member states which use CFA franc - which is backed by France. Negotiations for the joint currency have been in the works for 30 years.  The Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas), the region's political and economic union, said the rollout will be gradual with countries meeting the laid-out criteria joining first.  Eight countries already use the CFA franc, which is pegged to the euro, and is guaranteed by France. The other seven have their own currencies, none of them freely convertible. Proponents of the eco say the single currency will facilitate trade, lower transaction costs and facilitate payments amongst Ecowas' 385 million people.  However, critics worry that Nigeria, the region's biggest economy, will dominate monetary policy and stall the projected benefits.  For economists Ferdinand Backoup and Daniel Ndoye, a single currency would prove a valuable instrument in the international monetary system:  ""West African countries - like most other developing countries - are not immune to monetary shocks caused by policies implemented in the rest of the world,"" the pair wrote in a briefing note for the African Development Bank. A single currency can offer a chance, they say, to put up a ""collective and effective front"" against these disruptions. About the ECO It looks extremely unlikely that all 15 countries will meet this target. The single currency was first planned to be introduced in 2003 but the launch has been postponed several times; in 2005, 2010 and 2014. It is possible, although ambitious, that some countries will meet the current criteria for the 2020 deadline - the primary four being: These criteria, along with two other secondary ones, are due to be assessed by Ecowas by the end of 2019. One of the problems is inconsistency: countries could, for example, meet the criteria next year, and then fall behind the following year.  In 2016, only one country, Liberia, met all the six conditions, and no single criterion was met by all the countries.   Economist Martial Belinga, author of Liberate Africa From Monetary Slavery, says 2020 is a symbolic goal. ""It's more about the process,"" he said. ""Having a deadline pushes states to reach the criteria.""  Mr Belinga says Ecowas might want to consider revising the entrance criteria, as long as they remain credible.  Ecowas has said adoption would be gradual though, so the countries that do meet the criteria can join, and the others can follow later.  If the goal is to boost trade, some analysts are sceptical that a single currency is key. ""We struggle in Nigeria alone to get produce from the north to Lagos, and to other southern parts where it can be consumed,"" said Sanyade Okoli, head of Alpha African Advisory. ""If goods can't move freely, how can we even talk about a single currency? she asked. ""We need to address poor infrastructure, bureaucracy - the lower-hanging fruits first"". For Mr Belinga, the real impediment to trade in the region is not the lack of a single currency but that countries don't have much to trade.  ""West African countries must transform their economies, with diversification and added value industries,"" he says.  ""That's the real solution to face external shocks and volatility."" Currently, most countries rely on commodities whose prices are regulated on international markets.  For the economist, the single currency isn't ""an end in itself"". Although talk of a political federation has not dominated the latest discussions, critics point at pitfalls of running a joint currency without a political union.  Economists Ferdinand Bakoup and Daniel Ndoye say the commitment of regional leaders should allay such fears.  ""The creation of a presidential task force to monitor the single currency creation process, headed by the heads of state of Ghana, Nigeria and Ivory Coast and the Committee of Central Bank governors, is a glaring illustration,"" they said. ""What now remains is to transform this commitment by accelerating the implementation of reforms to help achieve this objective"". You may also be interested in: But despite their will to move forward, many also fear losing part of their sovereignty.  ""As Africa's largest economy and most populous country, we cannot afford to rush into such agreements without full and proper consultation with all stakeholders,"" said Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari. The next Ecowas meeting in December is likely to whip up some of these concerns.  Nigeria, whose oil-dependent economy accounts for two-thirds of the region's GDP, would dominate a future monetary union. Some economists have compared Nigeria to Germany's weight in the eurozone although Nigeria would be far more dominant in the eco. For Ms Okoli, that could be problematic.  ""We should have an honest conversation about how we feel about that,"" she says. ""Germany had a measure of restraint coming out of World War II, but we don't have that in Nigeria,"" she said.  It is, however, less of problem and more of an opportunity,  Mr Belinga argues.  ""There's always a leader in a union and I think we should hope Nigeria will play that role positively. When you look at what they've done for their economy, I see that as a positive signal of good leadership"".  ""At the same time,"" he says, ""Nigeria must see that this is an opportunity for them to access a massive market"". Although some describe the CFA franc as a colonial relic, some analysts say that what's been driving growth in francophone countries like Ivory Coast has been high investment because of low interest rates which come from a stable currency guaranteed by France. The Francophone countries might be hesitant to joining a union with countries that have much higher levels of inflation and interest rates. But the appeal to cut colonial links and embrace the eco as an African project is strong. ""Even if it creates instability, that's normal,"" says Mr Belinga, ""countries must disconnect from the franc"", he adds. "
Volatility,UK economy sees return to growth,2024-09-25,2011-04-27,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-13206430,"This video can not be played Mr Osborne said: 'Around the world we are facing some choppy economic conditions' The UK economy grew by 0.5% in the first three months of the year, official figures have shown, reducing the risk of a double-dip recession. The chancellor welcomed the return to growth, which followed a contraction of 0.5% at the end of 2010. But Labour said the economy was flat and the recovery had been ""choked off"".  The manufacturing and services sectors had performed well, the Office for National Statistics said, but construction output had fallen sharply.  Chancellor George Osborne said: ""It is good news that the British economy is growing. It is particularly good news that manufacturing is growing so strongly, when we have had such an unbalanced economy in recent years, and manufacturing has not done so well. ""Jobs have been created since the New Year and government borrowing is down,"" he added.  Ed Balls, Labour's shadow chancellor, responded: ""If George Osborne thinks zero growth over six months is good news and a sign that the recovery is on track then he is more out of touch and out of his depth than I feared. "" Economists gave a mixed response to the figures. David Kern, the chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: ""These figures were mixed and well below the Office for Budget Responsibility prediction that the economy would grow by 0.8% in the quarter.  ""Given the fragility of the recovery, it is vital for the government to persevere with policies that support growth, and remove the obstacles that prevent businesses from creating jobs and exporting."" Growth in manufacturing continued to be strong, at 1.1%, the same as the previous quarter. The GDP also figures showed that the services sector had returned to growth, after contracting during the bad weather at the end of last year. This had particularly been the case with hotels and restaurants, the ONS said.    However, construction - one of the worst hit areas in the last quarter of 2010 - was down by 4.7% at the start of 2011. Ross Walker, from RBS Financial Markets, said that as new data came in, the picture was likely to improve: ""You do have what looks to me like a surprisingly large fall in construction output. Do we really believe that the level of construction output was lower in January than in December? We may well see some revisions here."" These figures are an initial estimate and will be revised at least twice in the coming months as more information is gathered.  The low rate of growth could lessen the chance of an early interest rate rise by the Bank of England to combat inflation, which is currently running at 4%, analysts say. ""We are expecting the Bank of England to raise rates in August,"" said Deutsche Bank economist George Buckley, ""but it is far from certain whether they will do that"".   ""We will have the second quarter GDP numbers by then, but the problem is they may have been negatively affected by the royal wedding and two back-to-back bank holiday weekends which will depress production. ""It is still very uncertain. All of these figures are being affected by a lot of volatility, by holidays, the weather, snow. It has all had a big impact on the numbers.  The Prime Minister, David Cameron, said the growth in manufacturing indicated that the economy was moving away from its reliance on the service sector. But he added that bank lending was still a stumbling block: ""On the banks, we have an agreement with them they must increase their lending to businesses, large and small, and that needs to happen."" Separate figures released on Wednesday from the British Bankers' Association (BBA) showed that total net lending to companies fell in March by £4.7bn compared with a year ago, a slightly bigger fall than in February.  The BBA said in a statement that weak trading activity meant businesses were less likely to borrow money for expansion, and most were trying to pay down debts.

Volatility,Call for pump price investigation,2024-09-25,2011-05-30,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-13593591,"Petrol prices reached record levels in April An alliance of European motoring organisations has written to the European Union calling for an investigation into the price of fuel. The call comes from the Federation Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) in a letter to the European Union.  The group represents 35 million European drivers, including members of the RAC and AA in the UK. The FIA said the way petrol prices are currently set was ""far from transparent"". A full tank of fuel for an average European car now costs around £10 more than it did a year ago.  The price of fuel in the UK reached record levels in April as the cost of Brent crude rose above $125 a barrel. Although the price of crude has fallen $10 since then, motoring groups say the wholesale price of petrol has not fallen as fast. The price of crude oil is only one factor affecting the petrol price. Oil is traded in dollars, so the exchange rate against the dollar has a big impact on prices. Taxes, transportation and refining costs also vary - impacting the cost of fuel at the pump.  But the FIA says the EU should investigate the way petrol prices are set for the European market.  Most European petrol prices are derived from the Rotterdam spot market where some cargoes of petrol and diesel are bought and sold. But the FIA is not sure that this market works effectively. ""A platform with such a small volume is doubted to be a representative indicator for the vast European market,"" said Werner Krauss, chairman of the FIA Eurocouncil. This video can not be played Brian Madderson of RMI Petrol calls for 'fair competition' The organisation also wants the EU to look into the role of speculators who invest in the oil market. Mr Krauss claimed the ""resulting volatility"" in petrol prices had a negative financial impact on consumers. The complaint is backed by the UK motoring organisation the AA, which is calling for an independent regulator to oversee the petrol market. ""No one is giving us any answer as to why petrol prices are so high,"" said AA public affairs spokesman Luke Bosdet. ""We need greater transparency so everyone can see we are paying a fair price for fuel,"" he added.  Retailers have said that prices do go down when the cost of petrol has fallen. One way for sellers to balance the changing price of fuel is to buy in advance. The UK's largest supermarket, Tesco, say they try to keep prices low and will sometimes buy fuel in advance to balance changes in price. But in a statement the retailer said it was difficult to predict when to buy. ""As everybody knows, it's very difficult to predict movements in crude oil prices, which can go down as well as up. So it's wrong to say that buying in advance is necessarily an advantage,"" Tesco said in a statement.

Volatility,Sluggish Europe seeks new energy boost,2024-09-25,2011-02-04,Laurence Peter,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-12353792,"This video can not be played Europe tackles its energy-saving dilemmas EU leaders are meeting to consider the 27-nation bloc's ambitious energy targets on Friday - even if the Egypt crisis and eurozone debt woes are a big distraction. The EU's energy challenges, external are the focus of the European Council talks in Brussels - at least according to the official agenda.  The EU has set itself a ""20-20-20"" goal: a 20% cut in emissions of greenhouse gases by 2020, compared with 1990 levels; a 20% increase in the share of renewables in the energy mix; and a 20% cut in energy consumption. Huge investment is needed to modernise Europe's energy infrastructure, external, and most of it will have to come from the private sector.  The goal is to make the EU's diverse economies more joined up, to reduce their reliance on imported oil and gas and to increase the share of renewables such as wind and solar power in the energy mix. But progress towards a greener, more energy-efficient Europe is painfully slow, as governments are forced to tighten the public purse-strings and many companies struggle to get credit from banks. The economic downturn means that the pace of urban renovation has slowed in many countries - and with it, the installation of eco-friendly buildings, with modern smart meters and efficient insulation. But on the plus side, photovoltaic panels and other green innovations have got cheaper. The European Commission, steering EU energy policy, says about 1tn euros (£850bn; $1.4tn) will have to be invested over the next 10 years to modernise energy generation and supply. Solar panels on a Berlin block of flats: The cost of green technology has fallen But with budgets tight throughout Europe more incentives will have to be found to get the private sector to commit to big energy projects, where the returns tend to be long-term. The Commission reckons that about 60bn euros of EU budget funds will have to be invested in high-risk, cross-border projects deemed vital for Europe's future energy security. Supply weaknesses in Central and Eastern Europe were highlighted dramatically in January 2009, when a Russian gas transit dispute with Ukraine meant that many other countries suffered a gas shortage. Millions of people were left without heating in sub-zero temperatures. Many former communist countries, including Poland, Hungary and Slovakia, are overwhelmingly dependent on gas from Russia's Gazprom. North-south energy connections are seen as a priority - to link the Baltic energy market to the rest of Europe and to help develop South-East Europe, where many people live in energy poverty, spending a relatively high amount of income on fuel bills. The EU imports more than half of its energy supplies - equal to 2.5% of total EU economic output (GDP). With economic growth models still wedded to fossil fuels Europe remains hostage to rising energy prices and volatility triggered by events such as the Egypt crisis. Energy diversification has become a mantra in Brussels, as the EU wrestles with Gazprom's leverage and competes for declining resources with energy-hungry emerging powers like China and India. But making that diversification a reality is a big and expensive challenge. Electric cars need many more recharging points to be viable in Europe New partnerships are being forged with North Africa and Central Asia, to bring new sources of gas to European markets via a ""Southern Corridor"".  There are also technical challenges, such as engineering reverse gas flow, so that a shortage in one country can be eased by a neighbouring country pumping extra gas to it in an emergency. An ambitious plan to develop wind power in the North Sea requires new grid connections in several countries. In addition to the funding challenge, the time taken to get planning permission hampers big cross-border energy projects. But Danish liberal MEP Jens Rohde, a vice-chairman of the European Parliament's industry and energy committee, says that ""if you don't invest public money in the infrastructure you can forget all about wind power"". If Europeans could become more energy-efficient then the pressure on dwindling resources would be eased and greenhouse gas emissions would also decline. Yet the Commission has a bleak message on that front.  ""Regarding energy efficiency, we are seriously lagging behind. By 2020 we will only reach half of the 20% target if we carry on at the current pace,"" Energy Commissioner Guenther Oettinger said. He called for mandatory energy efficiency criteria in public building and transport projects. Many European politicians say energy efficiency standards need to be made binding, in the way that CO2 emission limits were in the EU. According to Mr Rohde, there is ""no one-size-fits-all"" because European tax systems vary so much. So incentives for energy-efficient behaviour will vary from country to country. But countries are slow to embrace energy-efficient technology such as smart cars and new meters, Mr Rohde says, because the end result is lower consumption - which means less fuel tax revenue and smaller returns for energy firms. The question of who pays for large-scale installation of smart technology has not been resolved, Giles Chichester MEP says. Mr Chichester, an energy specialist in the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) group, says that making energy efficiency data compulsory in house sales was a useful innovation in the UK. Lowering the sales tax (VAT) on work to modernise buildings would also help towards energy efficiency, he told the BBC. ""There is a case for public money to be invested in some basic efficiency, such as draught exclusion. There is a double benefit - better living conditions and jobs for local businesses,"" he said. There is great scope for such projects in ex-communist Central and Eastern Europe, where many people still live in apartment blocks with wasteful, old-fashioned heating systems, he added.

Mr Mubarak also dismissed his government and said a new cabinet would be announced on Saturday.  It was his first statement since the protests - in which at least 26 have died with hundreds injured - began.  Tens of thousands took part in protests in Cairo, Suez, Alexandria and other cities. Protesters set fire to the headquarters of the governing NDP party and besieged state TV and the foreign ministry. At least 13 people were killed in Suez on Friday, while in Cairo, five people died, according to medical sources.  That brings the death toll to at least 26 since the protests began on Tuesday.  ""I have asked the government to present its resignation today,"" Mr Mubarak said, adding that he would appoint a new government on Saturday. He also said he understood the protesters' grievances but that a thin line divided liberty from chaos and he would not allow Egypt to be destabilised.  One protester told the Associated Press news agency: ""We want Mubarak to go and instead he is digging in further."" This video can not be played Barack Obama: ""What's needed right now are concrete steps that advance the rights of the Egyptian people"" In a televised address shortly after Mr Mubarak spoke, US President Barack Obama said he had spoken at length with the Egyptian president and urged him to turn ""a moment of volatility"" into ""a moment of promise"". The BBC's Jon Leyne in Cairo says there had clearly been a lot of discussion behind the scenes before Mr Mubarak spoke to the country. But his comments will probably just provoke further unrest, says our correspondent - the people on the streets will be infuriated by his accusations that they are seeking to destabilise the country; they will also be inspired by the belief that, having wrung some concessions from him, they could yet oust him. After Mr Mubarak spoke, a sustained volley was heard from central Cairo, which our correspondent said could have been either tear gas or live fire. The Reuters news agency later quoted witnesses as saying more than 20 military vehicles rolled in to central Tahrir Square shortly after midnight, scattering protesters into the sidestreets. The BBC's Rupert Wingfield-Hayes, in Suez, says the streets of the port city were left to the protesters overnight but the army has now arrived there. After days of unrest, protests erupted again on Friday, as tens of thousands of protesters across the country turned out after Friday prayers shouting ""Down, down with Mubarak"" and, ""The people want the regime to fall"". The authorities announced a curfew from 1800 to 0700 local time (1600-0500 GMT), but it was immediately and widely flouted.  At several locations, riot police responded by firing rubber bullets and tear gas, and by using water cannon.  The headquarters of the governing NDP party was set ablaze, while protesters also besieged the state broadcaster and the foreign ministry.  The army secured the Egyptian Museum, next door to the NDP building and home to such treasures as the gold mask of King Tutankhamen, to protect it from looters. Internet and phone services - both mobile and land-line - have been severely disrupted, although protesters are using proxies to work around the restrictions.  The BBC said it would forcefully protest to the Egyptian authorities after a reporter for BBC Arabic, Assad Sawyer, arrested and beaten by plainclothes policemen in Cairo.  Mr Obama said he had told Mr Mubarak to respect the rights of the Egyptian people and refrain from using violence against peaceful protesters - but he said the protesters also had a responsibility to express themselves peacefully. He urged the Egyptian leader to take ""concrete steps that advance the rights of the Egyptian people"" and deliver on the promises of reform in his address. ""Violence will not address the grievances of the Egyptian people. And suppressing ideas never succeeds in making them go away,"" he said. ""Surely, there will be difficult days to come, but the United States will continue to stand up for the rights of the Egyptian people and work with their government in pursuit of a future that is more just, more free and more hopeful."" The BBC's Paul Adams in Washington said there is no immediate suggestion that the White House is cutting its ties with its long-time ally Mr Mubarak. But it is clearly giving him the chance to turn the unrest into what Mr Obama described as ""a moment of promise"", says our correspondent. Earlier, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said Washington would review its aid to Egypt based on events in the coming days.  This video can not be played Protesters react to President Hosni Mubarak's television address Egypt is the fourth largest recipient of American aid, after Afghanistan, Pakistan and Israel.  Britain, the US and France are all advising against non-essential travel to Egypt.  The unrest follows an uprising in Tunisia two weeks ago, in which President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali was toppled after 23 years in power.  The Tunisian upheaval began with anger over rising food prices, high unemployment and anger at official corruption - problems which also left many people Egypt feeling frustrated and resentful of their leadership."
Volatility,Coronavirus: Stocks bounce as volatility continues,2024-09-25,2020-03-17,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51921420,"Financial markets remain turbulent as a massive slowdown in economic activity due to the coronavirus takes hold across Europe and the US. In the US, shares rebounded about 6% after steep falls on Monday. London's FTSE 100 also jumped 2.7% after being down more than 1% earlier on Tuesday. Other major European markets made similar moves. It comes amid fresh promises of financial aid to helped bolster growth. In the US, President Donald Trump's administration said it was considering sending cheques to Americans as part of a $1tn stimulus package. The US Federal Reserve also said it would use emergency powers to purchase up to $1tn in short-term corporate debt directly from companies, reinstating a funding facility that was created during the 2008 financial crisis.  The Dow ended 5.2% higher, while the S&P 500 gained 6% and the Nasdaq rose 6.23%.  Meanwhile, in the UK, Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced £330bn in financial help for UK firms affected by the outbreak. The outgoing head of the Office For Budget Responsibility, Robert Chote, has said a temporary spike in borrowing would be sensible. Speaking to the Treasury Select Committee he said it was better to spend a ""little too much"" than too little, adding: ""When the fire is large enough, you just spray water"" (and worry about the clean up after). On Monday, French President Emmanuel Macron said his government would guarantee €300bn of loans, and pledged that no French company would be allowed to collapse. Italy, Germany, Japan and Spain have also all announced hundreds of billions of dollars in government relief. The scale of the US response - from both the central bank and the government - has been the most aggressive, even if many details remain unknown, said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS Markit. ""The good news is they're talking about it now, which is more than I can say about the Japanese or the Europeans,"" he said. ""It's too late to do anything to stop the recession. All you can do is limit the pain, limit the damage,"" he added. Earlier on Tuesday, Asian shares continued to see volatile trading on with markets in Tokyo, Hong Kong and Shanghai swinging between losses and gains.  The turbulence follows one of the worst days in history for US markets. The Dow Jones lost close to 13% and the S&P 500 fell almost 12%, marking the biggest one-day falls for both indexes since ""Black Monday"" in 1987. That followed the US Federal Reserve making another emergency rate cut on Sunday, prompting central banks around the world to ease policy in the biggest co-ordinated response since the global financial crisis more than a decade ago. In the last month, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has racked up the five biggest one-day points falls in its 135-year history. In March alone the index has also seen its four biggest one-day points gains on record. Wall Street's so-called ""Fear Gauge"" has just topped the levels seen during the financial crisis more than a decade ago. The Chicago Board Options Exchange's VIX, a measure of stock market volatility, surged by almost 43%, surpassing the level seen in 2008."
Volatility,Facebook reveals digital currency details,2024-09-25,2019-06-18,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48664253,"Social media giant Facebook has unveiled plans to launch a new digital currency, called Libra, next year. It said people would be able to make payments with the currency via its own apps, as well as on messaging service WhatsApp. Firms such as Uber and Visa are also likely to accept it in future, it said. But there have been concerns about how people's money and data will be protected, as well as over the potential volatility of the currency.  Facebook said Libra would be independently-managed and backed by real assets, and that paying with it would be as easy as texting.  It is the latest foray by a tech giant into the payments sector, after Google Pay, Apple Pay and Samsung Pay - although none of those services are based on a crypto-currency. According to Facebook, from next year you will be able to buy Libra via its platforms and store it in a digital wallet called Calibra.  You can then send your Libra to other users, it said, ""as easily and instantly as you might send a text message"". ""In time, we hope to offer additional services for people and businesses, such as paying bills with the push of a button, buying a cup of coffee with the scan of a code, or riding your local public transit without needing to carry cash or a metro pass."" It said transactions would be at ""low to no cost"", although the firm is expected to take a small commission on payments made through its platforms. It is a hugely ambitious - some might say megalomaniacal - project to create a new global currency.  But the message is that this is not some little side project that a small team at the firm's Menlo Park headquarters will try out for a few months before moving on to something else. This is both the future of Facebook and the future of money, an initiative which has seen an alliance of big players in payments such as Paypal and Visa, Silicon Valley players like Uber and Lyft and major venture capital firms. But there are still many questions about FaceCoin - or Libra as the firm wants us to call it. The principal one I keep coming back to is - why?  Facebook stressed Libra would be managed independently by a group of companies and charities - of which Facebook is just one - called the Libra Association. It said all the group's members were eventually likely to accept Libra, including:  Facebook also said it expected Libra would be bought and sold on currency markets in the future. Facebook said Libra was particularly aimed at the 1.7 billion adults worldwide who do not have a bank account.  It said the issue of being ""unbanked"" disproportionately affected people in developing countries, and in particular women.  However, while the social network says the currency will be global, apps and services that use Libra will need to be compliant with the regulatory regimes in the markets they operate.  While the currency already has the green light to launch in the US, it is unclear what will happen in places such as India, which has recently clamped down on digital currencies.  Reports in May suggested only about 12 markets would be ready for Libra by the time it has launched.  Facebook has faced questions from US politicians about how the currency will work, what consumer protection will be offered and how data will be secured. Other virtual-currencies such as Bitcoin have seen huge fluctuations in value, and have also been used to launder money.  Facebook meanwhile has been criticised for failing to protect its users' data in the past.  The social network hopes to prevent wild swings in the value of the currency by pegging it to a basket of well-known currencies, including the pound, US dollar, Japanese yen and euro.  Facebook also said its Calibra payments system would have strong protection to keep money and personal information safe.  It said Calibra would use the same verification and anti-fraud processes that banks and credit cards use, and would refund any money that was stolen.  This is not the first time Facebook has dabbled in digital currencies. A decade ago, it created Facebook Credits, a virtual currency that enabled people to purchase items in apps on the social networking site. However, Facebook ended the project after less than two years when it failed to gain traction. The biggest test is likely to be whether people will trust the social networking giant enough to start changing their cash for Libra. To build trust in the system, Facebook has been engaging with governments, central banks and regulators, including officials from the US Treasury and the Bank of England. "
Volatility,Global food prices fall for fifth month in a row,2024-09-25,2022-09-02,By Jonathan Josephs,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-62769675,"The UN's Food Prices Index has fallen for the fifth month in a row, in a sign that one of the main pressures pushing up the cost of living around the world could ease. The index fell to 138 in August and is now lower than it was before Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The countries were both major exporters of crops including sunflower oil, corn and wheat. The UN's Food and Agricultural Organisation says July's UN backed deal to re-open Ukrainian ports has eased cereal and vegetable oil prices. That has meant more supplies have been able to reach international markets. The FAO's Erin Collier told the BBC that ""prices came down for a mix of reasons"". Cereals have been the ""main driver"" of this year's growth in food prices, but Ms Collier explained supplies are now increasing because ""the harvest looks a little bit better, especially in Canada, the US and Russia"". All three are major exporters of wheat. For other food categories, ""an easing of export restrictions helped bring down sugar and oil prices, and weaker demand for certain products helped bring down meat and dairy prices"", added Ms Collier. Indonesia's temporary reduction in export taxes on palm oil has meant food manufacturers have had more options for the vegetable oils they use in huge quantities.  The cost of food has been one of the biggest contributors to inflation around the world. This week the Eurozone reported inflation was running at an annualised rate of 9.1% in August. Energy was the biggest contributor with increases of 38.3% but unprocessed food was next at 10.9%. The most recent inflation figures from the UK and the US paint a similar picture. The FAO index, a closely watched barometer, also showed that there were falls in the cost of its other food categories: dairy, meat and sugar. It said beef and other bovine product prices ""declined on weak domestic demand in some leading exporting countries"", perhaps reflecting that consumers are switching to cheaper alternatives. ""Growing concerns of a recession have led to fears that demand for foods like corn, meat, vegetable oils and other products will fall"", according to Kona Haque, head of research at the agricultural commodities firm ED&F Man. However, because of ongoing supply chain problems and the time it takes for price change to filter through, Ms Haque said that not all countries will feel the benefit of these lower prices immediately.  The FAO index has fallen sharply from March's record high of 159.7 but remains 10 points above where it was a year ago. Price volatility has increased according to Ms Haque, who cited recent heatwaves in Europe and floods in Pakistan as examples of the increasing influence of extreme weather on crops prices. This week Ukraine's agriculture minister Mykola Solsky warned forthcoming harvests would suffer because of the war. The area for planting wheat and barley for next year's harvest is set to fall at least 20% because of the Russian invasion. The Ukrainian Agrarian Council also says a lack of funds will lower production.  Ms Collier cautioned that even after these recent falls global food prices remain higher than during the 2011 peak.  ""There's a lot of factors at play right now that are still keeping prices high,"" she said. Those include soaring energy prices which mean that fertiliser remains very expensive for farmers, as well as ""supply uncertainty"".  ""Even though [some of] Ukraine's ports have opened that remains a very tentative situation, and the volumes are still quite small. We need to see those volumes increase to help bring prices down more""."
Volatility,Scottish prescription costs rise by 25%,2024-09-25,2018-07-24,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-44937793,"The cost of providing prescriptions has gone up by 25% in the last decade, with an ageing population and new drugs part of the reason. NHS figures show the total bill for 2017-18 was £1.3bn, which is 25.7% more expensive than 10 years ago. Paracetamol and aspirin are among the most commonly-prescribed drugs. In Glasgow, the average cost of prescriptions is about 8% higher than the Scottish average. The data, from the Information Services Division of NHS Scotland, said the overall cost amounted to £248.79 per person. In the NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde area, Scotland's largest health board, that figure rose to £271.30 per person, while NHS Orkney had the lowest average cost at £206.28 per person. Prescriptions have been free in Scotland since April 2011, a policy introduced by the SNP government. The figures showed 103.4 million items were dispensed on prescription in 2017-18 - an increase of more than a fifth over the last 10 years. Pregabalin, a drug used to treat epilepsy and chronic pain, had the highest total gross ingredient cost in 2017-18, at £36.38m. The most commonly-prescribed medication was omeprazole - used to treat indigestion, acid reflux, and stomach ulcers - with a total of 3.59 million prescriptions issued. Painkillers paracetamol and aspirin - both of which are available over the counter without a prescription - were the fourth and eighth most commonly-issued prescriptions, at 2.5 million and 2.01 million respectively. The report states that reasons for the increase in the number of prescriptions issued over the decade include; It also explains that there has been a shift from secondary to primary care for a number of high-cost medicines. The Scottish government said the figures had not been adjusted for inflation, but inflation would be a factor on the value of drugs in the global pharmaceuticals market. Scottish Conservative shadow health spokesman Miles Briggs has responded to the figures, saying he's concerned: ""With drugs such as paracetamol and aspirin often cheaper to purchase over the counter, we need to ensure that we are getting value for money for our NHS."" Labour health spokesman Anas Sarwar said: ""As more Scots continue to live longer, prescription costs are almost bound to rise due to more people living with long-term conditions that require treatment. ""This presents challenges not only for prescriptions but for a range of other services such as social care and GP practices. ""Labour continues to call on the SNP government to use the powers of the Parliament to give our NHS the funding it needs to end the staffing crisis in our health service."" Scottish Health Secretary, Jeane Freeman, said: ""The increase in costs for drugs dispensed in the community is in line with anticipated trend and reflects the fact more patients are being treated closer to home with specialist medicines traditionally reserved for hospital. ""These new treatments deliver better outcomes for patients and are best value for money for the NHS, however we expect NHS Scotland to always look for opportunities to work with pharmaceutical companies to reduce the cost for drugs wherever possible. ""Supply issues, an ageing population, increasingly complex health care needs, more people living with long term conditions, and the impact of the volatility in the value of the pound in recent years are also contributory factors to increased costs."" She then added: ""Legislation controlling what the NHS pays for medicines and supplies is currently reserved to the UK government and we are continuing to press them to ensure we can get best value."""
Volatility,Price inflation: Lumpy and sticky,2024-09-25,2023-07-10,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-66158714,"Harsh medicine for inflation does not have the same effect everywhere. Those who depend most on borrowing are those most affected by rising interest rates. That can most affect those in the early years of home ownership - typically young families, at a time of life when finances are already stretched. So the Bank of England's policy, fully supported by government and being reaffirmed by the central bank governor at a dinner on Monday - ""it is crucial we see this job through"" - is to put a chill on demand within the economy in the hope that it snuffs out inflation. By international standards, that's not going well. The UK has higher price inflation than comparable large economies, and core inflation, excluding the more volatile and international effects of energy and food, is rising. There are several reasons for that. Andrew Bailey's speech highlights the problem of unemployment. He doesn't say it in so many words, but the implication is clear, that unemployment simply isn't high enough to cause workers to moderate their wage demands.  Inflation is proving ""sticky"": ""Both price and wage increases at current rates are not consistent with the inflation target"". This is also due to the structure of housing finance, which has changed in recent decades and means that the financial pain, which is an intended consequence of higher interest rates, takes longer to feed through to spending and investing behaviour.  In turn, that slow effect on inflation means interest rates going higher and staying there for longer than previously foreseen. Only with price stability, argues Andrew Bailey, can the UK economy thrive, and only then can people ""trust that their hard-earned money maintains its value"". Those who do not depend on borrowed money are, obviously, less affected, and they are generally the more affluent households. In response to that, one former member of the rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee at the Bank of England, suggested this weekend that monetary policy (interest rate rises) should be aligned with at least temporary tax increases designed to spread the pain a bit more evenly. ""We're asking monetary policy to do all the work,"" Kate Barker told the Financial Times. ""We ought to be doing more of the work of driving out inflation by putting taxes up on the better-off."" Specifically? ""Income tax."" It may be that imbalance goes for parts of the UK as well.  The latest snapshot of the private sector across the nations and regions points to markedly different performance of the economy around the UK. The Purchasing Managers Index tells us the balance of how companies are getting on, when asked about a range of indicators: output, orders, backlogs of work, exports, recruitment and so on.  For June, Scotland comes out of it relatively well. Output was rising in the May figures, but it is now rising more strongly.  That puts it behind only London and south-east England in this measure of output, and a long way adrift from the negative figures for the south-west, East Midlands, north-east England and especially Wales. New orders tell a similar story, according to these figures from Royal Bank of Scotland and NatWest, with Scotland second only to London.  Yet, confidence about the future does not reflect that: it's been slipping in most parts of the UK, and Scottish firms last month had relatively low levels of confidence about growth over the next 12 months. Only Northern Ireland and north-east England were more downbeat. The issue that's been causing most concern across business, as with the government and Bank of England, has been rising prices. Input costs continue to rise for the vast majority of firms in this regular and wide-ranging survey, but that increase seems to be easing. However, it's a mixed picture. Scotland is behind only London in companies' perception of rising input costs. The prices then charged to customers are also still on the rise. That rate of increase has also been easing, but last month remained greater in Scotland than any nation or region other than London, the south-east and the north-east of England. Northern Ireland was found to have the least problem with rising input costs, and was passing on costs to customers at the lowest rate. That might have something to do with its increased integration into the European economy through seamless trade across the border with Ireland, while Brexit effects on the labour market and trade frictions contribute to a range of inflationary pressures on the British mainland. These figures provide only one month's snapshot. They offer the balance of business opinion, rather than gauging how bad or good it looks on either side of the balance.   The ordering of nations and regions can change. All of them face difficulties with price inflation, the tight labour market and economic uncertainty. But it offers some indication of the effect of economic policy being seen least in those parts of the country that are already relatively well off.  Most recent measures suggest Scotland's income per head trails only London, the south-east and east of England. Its property market is not given to the same volatility as England's and especially London's, so the impact of interest rates on house prices is more subdued.  The Halifax house price index, published on Friday, shows UK average house prices falling by 2.6% in the year to June - the third month of seeing that annual comparison going negative. Scotland's house prices went into the red for the first time in three years, but with a reduction of only 0.1% over the year. That's nowhere near enough of a fall for many of those with rising rents who would like to get on the housing ladder. But it continues both to reflect and to drive confidence about the economy more widely."
Volatility,Why did Man Utd not sign anyone?,2024-09-25,2018-08-09,Simon Stone,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/45133827,"This video can not be played I am going to enjoy this season - Mourinho Speaking to Manchester United's own TV station following a 1-0 defeat by Bayern Munich on 5 August, Jose Mourinho said his side would face ""a difficult season"" unless they signed at least one more player. At the time, United boss Mourinho was confident a new central defender would be recruited. It did not happen. Despite late excitement over a move for Uruguay's Diego Godin, which, it subsequently transpired, had fizzled out earlier in the week virtually as soon as it had been made, Mourinho's squad remains as it was on 4 July when Lee Grant arrived from Stoke as United's third-choice keeper. Thirty-six hours before the 2018-19 Premier League was set to begin - United welcome Leicester to Old Trafford on Friday night - Mourinho was asked if he had the ""tools to compete"" with Manchester City and Liverpool. ""I know the words you want me to say,"" he said. ""I think by the end of November, December you won't need words, you will see by then which teams are candidates to win the Premier League."" Does that mean there is trouble ahead for Manchester United? In short, they couldn't do the right deal. The confidence Mourinho expressed about United getting an additional signing on 31 July during the club's pre-season tour of the United States was based around multiple targets. They ranged from Leicester's Harry Maguire to Barcelona's Yerry Mina (who subsequently joined Everton), via seasoned internationals Jerome Boateng and - briefly - Godin. United have the money to do big deals. They were prepared to do exactly that to get a top player. Executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward would not have flinched had he been told £100m, a sum that would have smashed both United's club record transfer fee and the world record for a defender, was the price to be paid for for the right man. Why it is dangerous to write off Jose Mourinho - Shearer Mourinho warns of 'difficult season' But the right man never materialised. Over the course of a lengthy meeting between United and Real Madrid top brass in Miami last month, Raphael Varane never became a discussion topic because it was obvious the Champions League winners would not have sold him. Talks about Maguire never progressed beyond the outline stage because, with no need to sell and secure in the knowledge the England man had four years left on his contract, Leicester were pushing the price upwards, to the level Liverpool paid for Virgil van Dijk. For a man with no Champions League experience and still relatively new to the Premier League, United did not think entering the market at that level was wise. Raphael Varane played every minute of France's World Cup-winning campaign Godin's class is not in question either. The 32-year-old remains one of the best defenders in the world. Encouraged to go for the Uruguayan in the final days of the window, United discovered they were being used as leverage to net Godin a better contract extension from Atletico Madrid, so another door closed. Jerome Boateng was offered by Bayern Munich for about £40m. Mourinho was keen on the former Manchester City man. United, having analysed Boateng's awful appearance record - 33 games missed through injury and illness in two seasons - proposed a loan. Boateng and Bayern were not impressed. United were not impressed by the outcome of their negotiations over Mina, walking away from what they regarded as prohibitive agents' fees which, if they had agreed to them, would have set a dangerous precedent for a player who is hardly in the world-class bracket. Speculation surrounding a move for Tottenham's Toby Alderweireld rumbled on for much of the summer. It turned out to be unfounded. United never made a bid for the 29-year-old Belgian. As one club source said: ""We ended up in a situation where if we had done a deal, we would have been swapping our fifth best central defender for another fifth best central defender.""  Under the circumstances, United concluded there was no point. If anything sums up what seems to be a divergence of opinion over the short-term strategy at Manchester United, it is the treatment of Anthony Martial. In the United States, less than 20 days ago, it became apparent Mourinho was willing to let Martial leave. Anthony Martial was left out of France's World Cup squad this summer The decision was based around the comments of Martial's agent, Philippe Lamboley, who in a TV interview in June said that ""after considering all the factors and possibilities"" his client wanted out. In truth, the position suited Mourinho, who concluded a long time ago that Martial, who has a maximum two years left on his contract, goes missing at big moments. Evidently, that view is not shared by others at Old Trafford. The one conversation between Woodward and Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy this summer centred around the availability of Martial and Juan Mata. In both instances, Levy was told no. As the transfer window entered its final week, rumours surfaced that Martial might be sold to fund a move for Inter Milan's Ivan Perisic, of whom Mourinho is a long-standing admirer. Sources at Old Trafford were adamant that Martial would not be sold. So it has proved. Given Manchester United do not have a director of football, it is not absolutely clear who is making footballing decisions that contradict Mourinho's. And, despite Martial remaining, there is no obligation on the manager to pick him, which is exactly what happened at the weekend when the Frenchman remained in Manchester for a double training session rather than flying to Munich for United's final pre-season friendly. The reason for his absence? Martial returning to France for the birth of his daughter which ended his United States tour a week early. ""There is no story,"" said Mourinho. ""He had three days of pre-season. Then he had nine where he did no training and no football. Absolutely nothing [about it]. If you do that, you have to start again with the other people."" If Mourinho's ""difficult season"" assessment is taken at face value, the Portuguese is heading towards a turbulent few months. It is clear he has not got the players he wanted. Mourinho has given youth a chance at Old Trafford but he is also of the view that if Manchester City's dominance is going to be challenged, it must be with a core of experienced, top-quality players, who tend to be around 29 years of age with little resale value. Those responsible for signing the cheques tend to look longer term. Paul Pogba, for instance, was bought at huge cost, £89m, and comes with an enormous social media following, 5.62m on Twitter alone. In the modern game, such things matter. Paul Pogba has been reportedly linked with a move to Barcelona this summer, having won the World Cup with France in July So, whether Mourinho wanted to or not - and there is no evidence he did - Pogba would not have been sold this summer, despite suggestions the Frenchman would be open to exiting Old Trafford for a second time. United must also factor in market volatility in assessing their transfer dealings.  Neymar's £200m move from Barcelona to Paris St-Germain 12 months ago might be dismissed as an exception. But it created a ripple effect that led to Barcelona signing Ousmane Dembele and Philippe Coutinho for £135.5m and £142m respectively. Sir Alex Ferguson was ridiculed for saying there was ""no value in the market"" but United have to think seriously before adopting a ""pay what it takes"" stance. Ultimately, Mourinho has at his disposal the same squad that finished runners-up last season, minus the retired Michael Carrick, and plus Brazil World Cup midfielder Fred and teenage full-back Diogo Dalot.  In addition, to his satisfaction but the chagrin of many United fans, Mourinho also has Marouane Fellaini, who ended months of speculation by signing a two-year contract at the end of June. Will it be enough to close a 19-point gap to Manchester City and at the same time hold off an anticipated threat from a resurgent Liverpool? Mourinho says by the end of November it will be known which clubs will be Premier League title contenders. If Manchester United are not one of them, no-one would be surprised if those in charge start to get a succession plan prepared."
Volatility,Lessons must be learned from A6 delays - Campbell,2024-09-25,2023-04-04,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-65172930,"Lessons must be learned from the delays to the long-awaited A6 road upgrade, DUP MP Gregory Campbell has said.  The 16-mile (25.5km) stretch of road between Londonderry and Dungiven will open on Thursday. Work started in 2018 but has been beset by continual delays.  Mr Campbell also reiterated his calls for a public inquiry into the project.   The Department for Infrastructure's (DfI) Kaine Lynch said the project had to be delivered ""in extremely challenging circumstances"". He added there were many factors as to why there had been delays to the road opening, citing the Covid-19 pandemic, the increased costs of building materials and some materials being in short supply. Starting at the village of Drumahoe, the 16-mile section of dual carriageway will include a bypass around Dungiven. The road opened with speed limits and lane restrictions for a short period in summer 2022, but then later closed again as work continued. Speaking to BBC Radio Foyle's Breakfast Show, Mr Campbell said it was ""exceptionally good news"" that the project will be open before the Easter break.  ""It is great news but we should have had more information throughout - this was due to be finished more than a year ago,"" the East Londonderry MP said.   Mr Campbell said a public inquiry should happen, but added ""what is probably more important now is that the lessons of the delay over the past 18 months need to be learned for any future projects"". In Dungiven, local people welcomed the news.  Sheila McCartney from local clothing and giftware shop Nora & Katie said there was ""huge potential"" for businesses and tourism. ""We're just really looking forward to a nicer, less polluted, quieter Dungiven,"" she said. Local butcher Dessie McAleese said he was looking forward to the road's opening on Thursday. ""It's brilliant for the town because it is very congested, especially at the weekends, and the parking facilities are terrible."" Kaine Lynch said the DfI was ""delivering the largest road infrastructure project ever in Northern Ireland. ""We experienced the war in Ukraine, Covid-19, material shortages and supply chain issues.""   Mr Lynch said that in terms of scale of the project, they had more than 600 people working on the site in peak periods, have excavated enough material to fill Wembley Stadium in London and planted close to 750,000 trees. He conceded that ""people have waited a long time for this road"" but said that he is delighted that road users will be able to reap the benefits of it from Thursday.  Mr Lynch said 15,000 vehicles use the route each day and it will reduce journey time from Drumahoe to Dungiven by about 45% and be a ""significant benefit"" to improving road safety. The DfI had previously said the initial estimate of £220m was now likely to be in the region of £250m.  ""That is in the region of 12% over where we originally estimated,"" Mr Lynch said.  ""I know £30m is a lot of money, but given the scale of the project and the scale of the challenges that we faced I think that is a pretty good outcome."""
Volatility,Warning over fuel prices as oil hits 10-month high,2024-09-25,2023-09-19,By Michael Race,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-66852329,"Drivers have been warned of rising fuel costs after global oil prices surged to their highest level for 10 months. Brent crude, a benchmark for prices, breached $95 a barrel on Tuesday amid predictions of shorter supplies. It came as the International Energy Agency (IEA) said a decision by Saudi Arabia and Russia to cut production could cause a ""significant supply shortfall"" by the end of this year. The RAC motoring group warned drivers were ""in for a hard time"" at the pumps. Latest figures show UK drivers are now paying £1.55 on average per litre of petrol, with diesel at £1.59.  Since the start of August, average petrol prices have increased by 10p per litre and diesel prices by 13p. Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, oil prices soared, hitting more than $120 a barrel in June last year. They fell back to a little above $70 a barrel in May this year, but have steadily risen since then as producers have tried to restrict output to support the market. Saudi Arabia and Russia, members of the Opec+ group and two of the world's largest oil-producing nations, decided to reduce production earlier in August. At the same time, the US Energy Information Administration said on Monday that US oil output from its top shale-producing regions was set to decline in October for the third straight month, reaching its lowest level since May.  As the biggest exporter and the leader of the pack, Saudi Arabia wants oil prices to stay elevated to make sure it has a steady stream of income while it tries to diversify its economy. However, the West has accused Opec, whose members regularly meet to agree on production levels, of manipulating prices. Petrol and diesel prices have jumped in recent months, and further rises could lie ahead due to crude oil being the main component of fuel, motoring groups say.  The AA warned rising prices were coming at a time when fuel efficiency typically drops as a result of darker evenings due to engines needing to work harder with heaters and lights being used more. ""Drivers have been lashed by a 10p-a-litre rise in the cost of petrol since the beginning of August,"" said Luke Bodset, the AA's spokesman on pump prices. ""The only things in their favour have been daylight still in the rush hour and mild weather, which means less fuel consumption. The drivers now beginning to feel happier are those with electric cars."" RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said with oil heading back towards $100 a barrel, drivers were ""in for a hard time at the pumps"", but he added that a rise to three figures ""should really only take the average price up by another 2p"". But he warned: ""If retailers are intent on making more money per litre with increased margins then this could [take the average petrol price] closer to 160p."" Analysts warn rising global oil prices could impact inflation - the rate at which prices rise - in many countries. Inflation soared in 2022 and has only recently started to come down. ""The symbolically important $100 [a barrel of oil] mark is now being considered once more,"" said Sophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown. ""This is a difficult development, with fuel accounting for a significant portion of overall inflation."" The latest inflation figure for the UK will be released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) on Wednesday. Inflation has fallen in recent months but remains high at 6.8%. Over the last few years households have been hit by higher fuel and energy bills, while businesses have put up prices to cope with rising costs. A recent fall in the pound may have made fuel even more expensive. As well as supply and demand, oil prices are also affected by the exchange rate between the pound and dollar, as Brent crude is traded in dollars.  Saudi Arabia's Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman defended Opec+'s moves to restrict supply on Monday, saying energy markets needed light-handed regulation to limit volatility."
Volatility,Can India's Adani Group recover from $100bn loss?,2024-09-25,2023-02-07,By Archana Shukla,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-64495573,"India's Adani Group has seen its market value plunge after a US investment firm made fraud allegations against it. Can its ambitious growth plans survive?  Until two weeks ago, the ports-to-energy conglomerate which operates seven publicly traded companies had a combined valuation of $220bn.  But since 24 January, when short seller Hindenburg Research accused the group of ""brazen"" stock manipulation and accounting fraud, its valuations have nearly halved. The group's founder Gautam Adani has seen billions wiped off his personal wealth and has dropped out of the list of the world's top 20 richest people. The Adani Group has denied the allegations, calling them ""malicious"" and ""baseless"" and says it plans have not changed. But investors are clearly still nervous.  On Monday, the group said in a statement that it would prepay loans worth $1.1bn, taken using shares as collateral, ahead of their maturity date next year. This, it said, was partly due to ""continued market volatility"" and to assure investors that the group's promoters would ""prepay all shares-backed financing"". The announcement led to a rally in the flagship company's stock - on Tuesday, shares of Adani Enterprises closed 15% higher on the Bombay Stock Exchange. Last week, the group also called off its secondary share sale. The 2.5bn (£2bn) it had raised was meant to pay off debt and fund projects, including airport renovation, expressway construction and an ambitious green hydrogen ecosystem. They indicate investors are losing confidence in a company. Analysts are now watching to see how the stock price slide affects the company's operations, cash flow and expansion plans. ""Most of their ambitious projects will have to be heavily scaled back in ambition and timetable, because they will have next to no capacity to raise funds right now,"" says Tim Buckley, director at Climate Energy Finance, a think-tank that works on financial issues related to transition from fossil fuel to clean energy. It could borrow money to fund projects and acquisitions - a common strategy for infrastructure companies, which helped fuel the Adani Group's rapid growth. But the group's debt has grown at a faster pace than revenues and profitability, which some fear could raise risks of a default - a concern flagged by both the Hindenburg report as well as some analysts. The group already has total debt of nearly two trillion rupees ($24bn; £20bn) - it almost doubled over the past three years as Mr Adani's ambitions extended to areas such as 5G and green hydrogen. Nearly two-thirds of Adani's debt is from overseas sources such as bonds or foreign banks, according to a report by global brokerage Jefferies. Until now, the group has mostly raised funds by using its infrastructure assets or shares as collateral. But with stock prices plunging, the value of this collateral has also dipped. The private wealth units of two big banks, Credit Suisse and Citigroup, have stopped accepting Adani bonds as collateral, Bloomberg has reported.  Many Indian banks have also loaned billions of dollars to companies linked to the group and state-owned insurance firm Life Insurance Corporation of India has invested in it. Market observers say that the Hindenburg report and the reaction to it will make lenders cautious - which means loans could become costlier. ""There is pressure on the company's credibility. It will make it extremely difficult to raise fresh loans, especially in the overseas market,"" an Indian corporate banker said on condition of anonymity as he didn't want to be seen commenting on the Adani Group. Another observer, a former banker with an international wealth fund, said that the group may be forced to delay some projects until the issue settles down. He also did not want to be named. The BBC sent a list of questions to the Adani Group. A spokesperson replied: ""All our ongoing projects continue according to the plan. Adani Group's core fundamentals remain unchanged.""  Scrutiny on the group has now increased. Investors and credit rating agencies are closely assessing its ability to raise money and repay loans. S&P Global Ratings has downgraded its outlook on two Adani companies to negative. ""New investigations and negative market sentiment may lead to increased cost of capital and reduce funding access for rated entities,"" it said.   In a video statement after the group's share sale was called off, Mr Adani had said that its balance sheet was ""healthy and assets robust"". He added that the group has an ""impeccable track record of fulfilling our debt obligations"". But credit rating agency ICRA said in a statement last week that the group's large, debt-funded capital spending programme remains a key challenge. Most of the group's capital-guzzling new businesses such as green energy, airports and roads are housed under flagship company Adani Enterprises Ltd (AEL) and depend on it for funds. AEL has enough cash but could come under pressure if it has to pay interest for even its subsidiaries. Some of the group's firms will be shielded from the current volatility because they own and operate strong physical assets such as ports, airports and factories. ""Adani Ports and Adani Power are the strongest and most well-capitalised [firms], which means their assets are backed by long-term government contracts. Most of the loans taken by these companies are against these revenue and profit-accruing assets,"" says the corporate banker quoted above. However, this isn't the case for some of the group's newer businesses. Companies such as Adani Gas and renewable energy arm Adani Green already have immense debt on their books and are still building up their cash flows. This could make them more vulnerable to market shocks and reduce their creditworthiness. The banker points out that while the prices of bonds issued by Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd have fallen only marginally, those issued by Adani Green had lost more than a quarter of their value in three days. Deferring new projects and selling some assets to raise money could be a way out. ICRA has said that some of the planned capital spending is discretionary in nature and can be deferred, depending on how much liquidity it has. ""The company has built assets that are valuable to a developing country like India, and there will be many strategic investors interested,"" said a corporate adviser who didn't want to be named. Some analysts remain optimistic. ""I have seen varied operating [Adani] projects from ports, airports, cements to renewables which are solid, stable and generating a healthy cash flow. They are completely safe from the ups and downs of what happens in the stock market,"" says Vinayak Chatterjee, an infrastructure expert who is founder and managing trustee of the Infravision Foundation.  Analysts are also watching to see if there will be a regulatory enquiry into the group's corporate governance. The issue has also set off a political row over Mr Adani's perceived closeness to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which both deny.  On Tuesday, Rahul Gandhi from the main opposition Congress party brought up the allegations in parliament, accusing Mr Modi of helping the Adani Group - his comments caused uproar, with a federal minister accusing Mr Gandhi of levelling ""wild allegations"" without proof.    A day earlier, the party had held protests across the country, demanding an investigation into the allegations. Mr Buckley says that as pressure mounts, the Adani Group's ability to win government contracts easily to ramp up revenues will be challenged. It will also find it difficult to restore its credit credibility.  Since the group has to repay a significant amount, it will have to do a strategic asset sale, he says. "

On Sunday, the chairman of UBS bank and former Bundesbank head Axel Weber joined the chorus of Bitcoin warnings. ""Bitcoin is not money,"" he said in an interview, and urged regulators to intervene.  Meanwhile the French finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, has called for the issue to be discussed at the G20 summit of major economies in April.  ""There is evidently a risk of speculation. We need to consider and examine this and see how... with all the other G20 members we can regulate bitcoin"", Mr Maire told the French news channel LCI.  Bitcoin prices have surged this year: a single bitcoin stood at less than $1,000 in January and hit a record $19,783 on Sunday, according to Coindesk. Analysts believe CME's entry into the Bitcoin market will generate more interest in the crypto-currency, possibly pushing the price higher.  The CBOE futures contract is based on a closing price of Bitcoin from the Gemini exchange, which is owned and operated by virtual currency entrepreneurs and brothers Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss. However, the CME contract price will be culled from multiple exchanges, potentially offering investors more transparency about the value.  ""The CME [futures] contract is based on a broader array of exchanges,"" said Matt Osborne, chief investment officer of Altegris, which has $2.5bn in alternative investments.   ""So there is a possibility that the CME contract may generate more interest and more volume. ""Volumes are going to slowly increase as professional traders get comfortable with the price action and more importantly get comfortable with the volatility."" Institutional investors are prohibited from buying Bitcoin directly because the market is unregulated, but they can buy futures contracts. Futures are contracts that allow investors to bet on the price of something at a future date.  Investors can now bet on Bitcoin rising or falling in price without actually owning them. Futures are typically based on the price of a real commodity - such as oil. One of the controversial aspects of Bitcoin is that some do not see it as a ""thing"". Although it is called a currency, it can be argued it is an asset, or commodity, without any actual use or real assessable value.  CBOE Bitcoin futures surged nearly 20% on their debut last Monday, and more than 4,000 contracts changed hands by the end of the day. But as interest in the digital currency increases, so do the warnings.  Mr Weber told the Swiss Sunday newspaper that investors should resist jumping on the Bitcoin bandwagon, saying the bubble would inevitably burst. He said Bitcoin does not fulfil the three main functions of money because, in his view: it is not an effective means of payment; it is not a good measure of value (since prices are not written in Bitcoin); and it is not an effective way to store value, since it is inherently unstable. UBS advises clients against investing in the virtual currency, he said, because the bank does ""not consider it valuable and not sustainable"". To protect investors who do not take the bank's advice, ""regulators are needed,"" Mr Weber said. However, many people say financial regulation is difficult, if not impossible, because transparency was not part of Bitcoin's creation. Bitcoin was set up in 2008 by an individual or group calling themselves Satoshi Nakamoto, and was the first digital currency to successfully use cryptography to keep transactions secure and hidden. "
Volatility,US spies peer into the future - and it's not rosy,2024-09-25,2021-04-08,By Gordon Corera,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-56683852,"The US Intelligence Community has issued a survey of where the world may end up in 2040. It warns of a political volatility and growing international competition or even conflict.  The report entitled A More Contested World is an attempt to look at key trends and outlines a series of possible scenarios. It is the seventh such report with one coming every four years since 1997 from the National Intelligence Council. The Global Trends 2040 report does not make comfortable reading if you are a political leader or international diplomat - or hope to be one in the coming years. The latest attempt by the US National Intelligence Council to understand what may happen within and between countries points to uncertainty and instability. It firstly focuses on the key factors driving change. One is political volatility. ""In many countries, people are pessimistic about the future and growing more distrustful of leaders and institutions that they see as unable or unwilling to deal with disruptive economic, technological, and demographic trends,"" the report warns.  Vulnerable democracies It argues people are gravitating to like-minded groups and making greater and more varied demands of governments at a time when those governments are increasingly constrained in what they can do.  ""This mismatch between governments' abilities and publics' expectations is likely to expand and lead to more political volatility, including growing polarisation and populism within political systems, waves of activism and protest movements, and, in the most extreme cases, violence, internal conflict, or even state collapse."" Unmet expectations, fuelled by social media and technology, could lead to risks for democracy.  ""Looking forward, many democracies are likely to be vulnerable to further erosion and even collapse,"" the report warns, although adding that these pressures will also affect authoritarian regimes. Pandemic a massive 'global disruption' The report says the current pandemic is the ""most significant, singular global disruption since World War II"", which has fuelled divisions, accelerated existing changes and challenged assumptions, including over how well governments can cope. The last report in 2017 included such a possibility - imagining that ""the global pandemic of 2023"" dramatically reduced global travel to contain its spread.   The authors acknowledge they did not expect Covid-19, which they say has ""shaken long-held assumptions about resilience and adaptation and created new uncertainties about the economy, governance, geopolitics, and technology"".  Climate change and demographic shifts will also be key drivers, as will be technology, which could prove disruptive but also empower those who harness it fastest and first. Geopolitical competition Internationally, the analysts expects the intensity of competition for global influence to reach its highest level since the Cold War over the coming two decades amid the continuing weakening of the old order as institutions like the United Nations struggle.  Non-governmental organisations, including religious groups and what are called ""technology superstar firms"" may also have the ability to build networks that compete with - or even - bypass states. The risk of conflict may increase, with it becoming harder to deter new weapons being used.  Jihadist terrorism is likely to continue but there is a warning that extreme right- and left-wing terrorists promoting issues such as racism, environmentalism and anti-government extremism could revive in Europe, Latin America and North America.  Groups could use artificial intelligence to become more dangerous or use augmented reality to create ""virtual terrorist training camps"". The competition between the US and China lies at the heart of many of the differences in the scenarios - whether one of them becomes more successful or whether the two compete equally or divide the world into separate silos. Read more by Gordon Corera A 2004 report also predicted a caliphate emerging out of the Middle East, much as the Islamic State group tried to create in the last decade, although the same report - looking ahead to 2020 - did not quite capture the competition with China which now dominates US security thinking.  The overall aim is to look at possible futures rather than predict with certainty. Stronger democracies or 'the world adrift'? There are some optimistic scenarios for 2040 - one called ""the renaissance of democracies"".  This involves the US and its allies harnessing technology and economic growth to deal with domestic and international challenges, while China and Russia's crackdowns (including in Hong Kong) stifle innovation and strengthen the appeal of democracy.  But others are bleaker.   ""The world adrift scenario"" imagines market economies never recovering from the Covid pandemic, becoming domestically deeply divided and living in an international system that is ""directionless, chaotic and volatile"" as international rules and institutions are ignored by countries, corporations and other groups. One scenario, though, does manage to combine pessimism with optimism.  ""Tragedy and Mobilisation"" imagines a world in the midst of a global catastrophe in the early 2030s thanks to climate change, famine and unrest - but this in turn leads to a new global coalition, driven in part by social movements, to address the problems. Of course, none of the scenarios may come to pass or - more likely - a combination or something entirely novel may emerge. The aim, the authors say, is to prepare for an array of possible futures - even if many of them look far from rosy."
Volatility,Nation's Scottish love affair is back,2024-09-25,2021-06-23,Scott Mullen,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/57575587,"This video can not be played Euro 2020: Andy Robertson pays tribute to the fans after Scotland's Euros exit Euro 2020 on the BBC Dates: 11 June-11 July. Venues: Amsterdam, Baku, Bucharest, Budapest, Copenhagen, Glasgow, London, Munich, Rome, Seville, St Petersburg. Coverage: Live on BBC TV, BBC Radio, BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and app. Click here for more details It is the summer the world hopes ushers in a new normal. Standing at the side of the pitch at Hampden late on Tuesday, it was a sentiment which crackled in the quivering voice of Andy Robertson. In the wake of the nation's Euro 2020 exit, the Scotland captain spoke of getting a taste of being at a tournament. He also made proclamations of his hunger, and that of his team-mates, to get to another.  Then, a mention of what it meant to the nation, and a lump the size of the Clyde Tunnel appeared in Robertson's throat. ""The love that we've felt from this country has been incredible,"" he said, the normally assured footing of the Liverpool left-back giving way on the final word.  He spoke of fans in the streets, flags in the windows, a thunderstorm of noise inside Hampden as Callum McGregor breathed life into a nation. It was raw stuff as Robertson just about held it together. With the passing of time, he and his team will be able to arrive at a place of ease when they reflect on a summer which ended a 23-year wait for the country's men to reach a major finals. Some in the squad, let alone supporters, weren't even born in time to see Tom Boyd put into his own net against Brazil in 1998.  Well, welcome to the club, kids, where passion, optimism and the ability to boogie are compulsory. Sadly, so too is the fact you will likely suffer through every game you watch, regardless of the end result. Scotland's Euro dream ended by Croatia McGinn wants Euros 'to just be start' How genius of Modric sunk Scotland 'Scots learn lesson at tough school' As a nation, Scotland is obsessed with the past. Never getting out of a group at a major finals. Not having the same world-class standard of player as Dalglish, Jordan, Law. Watching Taggart.  We have been a race cowering under a cloud of inevitable doom, crippled by a national conscription somewhere between self-deprecation and hope. Depending on a result against the Faroe Islands, the latter generally fluctuates violently between false and lost. For all that, though, this is the summer Scotland must learn to forget the past and the glorious failure within. This is the time a nation and its team were reunited 23 years on from a French holiday romance. C'est magnifique. It was Alfred Lord Tennyson who famously wrote: ""It is better to have loved and lost than to have never reached the Euros in the first place."" And Alf has a point. Horror was etched on the faces of Scotland fans as David Marshall was outdone by Patrik Schick from 50-odd yards against the Czech Republic. There was also a collective hush as the blessed right boot of Luka Modric detonated any remaining belief of progression. But nothing would have compared to the anguish of spending £150 on a ticket to watch Israel do it all instead. This video can not be played Scotland hopes ended by Croatia Scotland began their march to the Euros in inauspicious fashion. A 2-0 win over Albania almost three years ago kicked it off. Only 17,455 bothered to turn up in pre-Covid times, a sign of the apathy towards a national team who had been battered by Belgium just days before.  Of that starting XI, only five remained to see the journey through. An ageing squad needed renewing.  A month later, 10-man Scotland lost 2-1 after a Kieran Tierney own goal in Israel under Alex McLeish. November 2018 brought a 4-0 trouncing of Albania as Ryan Fraser and James Forrest shone, the latter going on to bag a hat-trick three days later against - you guessed it - Israel to send Scotland into a Euro 2020 play-off semi-final almost a year later against - yep - Israel. After Kazakhstan - let's say no more - Steve Clarke brought a calmness to the Scotland set-up. The volatility of results and reaction which plagued McLeish's turbulent second spell had dispersed, but so too had the squad's scoring touch. A tense 0-0 at Hampden with the Israelis last October went the distance, with the Scots triumphing in a shootout.  But if you thought that was torture... a generation-defining night in Belgrade, where Scotland broke the cycle. Ryan Christie had them in front, only for an injury-time goal to force extra time. For many old timers, this was a path that had been sombrely trodden before. This is where the journey usually ended.  Instead, heroics, character, courage and cojones the size of Stephen O'Donnell's empire biscuits saw Scotland lift a nation out from under that cloud, all from a distance of 12 yards. Pictures of the scenes which followed, including a blubbing Christie live on television, deserve to be hung in galleries across the country as works of art. Scotland were back. This video can not be played 'Back in the game!' McGregor's vital goal brings Scotland level against Croatia The Scotland rollercoaster was put into cold storage for a few months before we all strapped ourselves in at the start of the month.  Countless words were spoken, thousands of them were written down, and hours of television, radio, podcasts and whatever else beamed out across the country. If you didn't know who Baccara were, that Arsenal defender Tierney is the squad DJ, or that Billy Gilmour was quite good at football, you really weren't paying attention. It was a build-up to a sporting event like few other the country has seen. With the help of technology it was inescapable. We even had national campaigns, led by the fantastic 10-year-old Poppy Lord, for school children to be allowed to watch the opening match against the Czech Republic.  The fact such an intervention was needed in some cases perhaps points towards a reason why Scotland have struggled for so long to reach a younger generation. By the time Schick's long-range missile was half way over Marshall's head, those poor kids would have been wondering what they'd been signed up for. ""We missed double maths for this?"" Scotland were beaten, but not defeated. Undone by the Czechs, Clarke's side had enough about them to offer some positivity going to Wembley four days later. What followed in London could not have been foreseen as the Three Lions were hushed to a whimper by a swashbuckling performance.  It may have only been a draw, but the Scots were off the mark in the tournament. Pride restored? Check. Full belief in beating the World Cup finalists next? Check. In the end, Croatia's experience at this level told. Nobody in the tournament has tossed more balls into the box than Robertson. Scotland averaged more shots than most of the big hitters have so far. In the end, they were undone by two things. A lack of cutting edge - 41 shots and only one goal - and inexperience. Scotland fans look on dejected at Hampden as Croatia win 3-1 Yet, what matters is not what happened this summer. It's about what happens next. Clarke has professed himself willing to steer this Scotland ship into smoother and far-flung waters, with the World Cup in Qatar the next port of call. It won't be easy, but he and his players will travel richer for what they have experienced not just over the past nine days, but the past nine months. For the first time in years, there is a connection with this Scotland team, many of whom appeared the most unlikely of generations to end the wait for a men's tournament return. After all, players such as McFadden, Fletcher, Maloney, Ferguson, McGregor and Dailly all failed.  Instead, Aberdeen's veteran defender Andy Considine played his part, as did the Motherwell pairing of O'Donnell and Declan Gallagher. For all the squad contains two Champions League winners, this is now a team of the people. At Wembley, we were all Stephen O'Donnell. While brief, Gilmour's intervention against England made both heart and hope soar. The inclusion in the squad of Nathan Patterson and David Turnbull point to a confident and gifted future, too. Scotland may have not qualified, but whether they did or not is not what will define what happens next. It never was going to. Robertson and his team-mates have shaken off the chastening shackles of the past. It's now time for the nation to enjoy the freedom of dreaming about what may lie ahead.

Volatility,Power NI electricity prices to fall by 10%,2024-09-25,2022-10-14,By John Campbell,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-63256308,"Power NI customers will see electricity prices fall by 10% from the start of November as a result of the energy price cap. The cap will more than reverse a 60% increase which would have applied from the same date. This cap sets the highest amount suppliers are allowed to charge domestic households for each unit of energy they use. It has been in place in other parts of the UK since the start of October. It will apply to all electricity and gas suppliers in Northern Ireland from the start of November. Customers in Northern Ireland who saw prices rises in October will receive some form of rebate so they are on an equal footing with people in GB. Power NI is the largest electricity supplier in Northern Ireland, with about 471,000 domestic customers which is more half of all connections. Power NI last changed its prices in July when it put them up by 27.5%; that followed a 21.4% increase in January William Steele, Director, Power NI Customer Solutions, said: ""As many customers will already be aware, the UK Government has announced a major intervention into the energy market called the Energy Price Guarantee (EPG).  ""This means that from 1 November 2022, energy bill support will be provided to Northern Ireland residential customers, by reducing the underlying cost of electricity.  ""Although we now must substantially increase our underlying price to reflect the current market, the implementation of the EPG will mean our customers will see a reduction in their billed tariff level of 10%.""  The NI Utility Regulator said with the cap in place the typical Power NI customer's bill will be 38% lower than the equivalent in Great Britain and 48% lower than the equivalent in the Republic of Ireland. ""Further tariff reviews for all suppliers are likely given the ongoing volatility of wholesale prices and the effect of changes to the EPG discount - the latter to be announced by the UK Government every three months going forward,"" John French, Chief Executive of the Regulator added. ""Separate to the energy price guarantee support, we are working with the UK Government and local energy suppliers to ensure that the £400 Energy Bill Support Scheme payment is paid to Northern Ireland consumers as soon as possible."""
Volatility,How much market chaos did the mini-budget cause?,2024-09-25,2022-10-13,By Reality Check team,https://www.bbc.com/news/63229204,"New Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has reversed almost all of the tax measures outlined by his predecessor Kwasi Kwarteng three weeks ago.  The mini-budget of 23 September - included £45bn of unfunded tax cuts - and was followed by days of turmoil on the markets, a fall in the value of the pound and rises in the cost of UK government borrowing and mortgage rates.  Prime Minister Liz Truss subsequently sacked Mr Kwarteng and acknowledged that ""it is clear that parts of our mini-budget went further and faster than markets were expecting"".  Previously, Ms Truss, Mr Kwarteng, Business Secretary Jacob Rees-Mogg and other ministers had defended the mini-budget, focusing on the effect of global factors like rising inflation and interest rates rather than acknowledging that the 23 September announcement had a profound impact. So, what has been going on?  It is true that interest rates have been rising around the world as central banks, including the Bank of England (BoE), try to control inflation, made worse by Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the energy price shock which followed. On 22 September, the BoE announced it was increasing the UK's base rate by 0.5 percentage points, to 2.25%. This is the interest rate on which commercial banks base the amount you pay for borrowing money, and what banks pay you for saving money with them.  The day before, the US central bank had raised its interest rates by more - 0.75 percentage points to between 3% and 3.25%. Following the BoE's decision, the UK government's long-term borrowing costs - the interest rate the government has to pay to borrow money on the international markets - rose immediately. By the BoE's own analysis, long-term gilt yields were 0.2 percentage points higher at the end of the day as compared with the start. The next day - 23 September - Mr Kwarteng delivered his mini-budget starting at 09:35 BST. This included the government's support scheme for energy bills - which had already been announced. This was due to last two years for households and the Treasury estimated it would cost £60bn for the first six months. It also included a cut in National Insurance and the reversal of a planned rise in corporation tax. These tax changes were pledged by Ms Truss during her Conservative leadership campaign and were widely expected to happen. But Mr Kwarteng went further, announcing he would cut the basic rate of income tax a year earlier than expected and get rid of the top rate altogether.  The package of tax cuts announced in the mini-budget totalled £45bn and were unfunded in that the government did not set out what savings it might make.  The mini-budget was not accompanied by an assessment of its plans by the government's official spending watchdog - the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) - as happens at every budget.  Following the chancellor's statement, the UK government's cost of long-term borrowing rose sharply. According to the BoE, long-term gilt yields rose 0.3 percentage points over the course of the day.  The markets were closed over the weekend, but in a BBC interview on Sunday 25 September, Mr Kwarteng indicated there were more tax cuts to come.  On Monday 26 September, the pound fell to record lows against the dollar in early trading in Asia. There was also a sharp rise in the cost of long-term government borrowing. Long-term gilt yields had gone up 0.5 percentage points by the end of the day, according to the BoE. Comparing the cost of government borrowing - on this measure - across the G7 group of advanced economies, it is clear that there was a sharp spike in UK long-term borrowing costs following the mini-budget - which wasn't seen in the other countries.  If you just look at the changes to the cost of government borrowing since 1 September (Liz Truss officially became prime minister on 6 September) the trend is even clearer. The cost of borrowing for the UK government has risen considerably more in that period than it has in other G7 countries. This increase fed through into rising mortgage rates with hundreds of products withdrawn from the mortgage market.  It also had an impact on UK pension funds - which trade in government debt (30-year gilts). The BoE described the speed and scale of movements in interest rates on UK government bonds as ""unprecedented"". It had to step in to safeguard the pensions sector with a support scheme - worth a potential £65bn. The change to corporation tax was a key pledge Liz Truss made during her Conservative leadership campaign. On 11 August, she said she wanted to scrap the planned rise because, ""I don't think that's a good way to get our economy going and to attract investment into our country.""  The National Insurance cut was another of her campaign promises that made it into the mini-budget. On the scrapping of the top rate of income tax, Ms Truss was asked who had come up with this - she said it was the chancellor's decision. Mr Kwarteng was asked whether he had got her backing for it before the announcement and replied, ""of course"". On the absence of the OBR from the mini-budget, Ms Truss said the government didn't have time to wait for its forecast. The OBR wrote in a letter that it would have been in a position to produce an updated forecast for the 23 September announcement.  On the morning of 14 October, a Number 10 source told the BBC that the prime minister and chancellor were ""in lockstep"" - hours before she sacked him.  Speaking on 29 September, BoE Chief Economist Huw Pill said the turmoil on the markets in part ""reflects broader global developments... but there is undoubtedly a UK-specific component"". On 12 October, Sanjay Raya, chief economist at Deutsche Bank, told a committee of MPs that Russia's invasion of Ukraine as well as high inflation were causing global instability and volatility in the markets.  But he added that there was ""absolutely a UK component here"". Mr Raya said: ""You throw on the 23 September event, you've got a sidelined fiscal watchdog, lack of a medium-term fiscal plan, one of the largest unfunded tax cuts that we've seen... since the early 1970s and it's sort of the straw that broke the camel's back."" Institute for Government chief economist Gemma Tetlow told the same committee that part of the problem had stemmed from the government undermining key economic institutions, ""questioning their credibility and not asking for a forecast from the OBR"". She added that while the temporary emergency measures to limit energy prices probably could have been announced without an OBR forecast, ""permanent changes to the tax system, which didn't need to be announced so quickly"", could have waited for OBR assessments and ""a full briefing from Treasury officials"".  Gerard Lyons, an economist who advised Ms Truss and Mr Kwarteng during the leadership contest, speaking on the BBC's World at One programme admitted that the mini-budget ""misread"" the country's financial situation. However, he argued that everything that has happened was not ""solely due to the mini-budget"" but also down to parts of the financial system that were vulnerable to interest rates going up. On 3 October, Mr Kwarteng U-turned on plans to scrap the top rate of income tax.  On 14 October, Ms Truss sacked Mr Kwarteng and announced a U-turn on corporation tax, confirming it will rise after all. On 17 October, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt announced that ""almost all"" the tax measures of the mini-budget will be reversed - apart from the National Insurance cut and the changes to stamp duty. The energy bills support scheme will last for six months, rather than two years.  What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate? Get in touch Read more from Reality Check"
Volatility,Scotland's shops see business rate bills fall,2024-09-25,2023-05-18,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-65615356,"Scotland's shops are seeing a fall in business rate bills of nearly 10%, following revaluation from the start of last month.  New figures from the Scottish government reflect changed rental values, on which bills are based.  These have been updated by council assessors for the first time in six years, and form the basis for levying £3.86bn in tax.  Most pubs and restaurants are also seeing an average 5% drop in bills. Within that, smaller premises are gaining from more of a cut, while the largest ones are seeing their bills go up. Larger shops have bigger cuts than small ones. For those with a rental valuation between £100,000 and £1m, retail bills are down 13%. Many smaller shops do not have to pay business rates, due to the Scottish government's Small Business Bonus Scheme. Nearly two-thirds of hotels - including guest houses, hostels and some self-catering properties - have seen valuations rise slightly.  A system of transitional relief has been applied, to reduce volatility of business rates, and that means the average bill for hotels is down.  For factories, rateable values are up 10% and bills up by 8%, with the largest industrial sites facing a much higher increase. The biggest increase in total costs is in the category of ""designated utilities"", which often cross council boundaries. These include power transmission lines, pipelines, railways, waterworks, telecoms and docks. The bill for these has risen 13%, to £840m. There are wide variations across the country, with Aberdeen the big gainer. The city's total business rates bill is down by 17%. It was hit by big increases in the 2017 revaluation, which reflected a booming local economy due to high oil prices at the time the previous valuation was set. Renfrewshire and Aberdeenshire businesses are also seeing a decline in bills. Business rate bills for Aberdeen shops fell 19% last month, but were up in Shetland.  Meanwhile, Aberdeen office bills are down by 26%, but Edinburgh offices have seen a 19% rise.  Aberdeen's hotels are seeing valuations down 20%, while in Argyll and Bute, they are rising by 60%, and by more than 20% in East Dunbartonshire, East Lothian and Na h'Eileanan Siar (Western Isles). A greater value attached to whisky distilleries in Moray explains why valuations in that county have risen more than most local authority areas. As part of the New Deal for Business announced by First Minister Humza Yousaf, one of the projects being taken on by the advisory group is further reform of business rates, also known as non-domestic rates.  Retailers have led the campaign for reform, as conventional shops face costs from the current system which are not being required of their online competitors.  There has also been criticism of the system for being inflexible in the face of changing revenue and profitability for businesses."
Volatility,What is new about this year's A-levels?,2024-09-25,2017-08-16,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/education-40946785,"Thousands of teenagers across England, Wales and Northern Ireland are receiving their A-and AS-level results. But, in England, there have been changes to this year's A-level qualifications - the BBC News website sets out the changes. Under the new system, students sit all A-level exams at the end of two years of study, instead of taking modular exams throughout the course.   AS-level results no longer count towards A-level grades.  No subject will have more than a 20% coursework component and most courses will be assessed entirely through exams.  Resits will still be available, but January exams will be scrapped, so students will have to wait until May/June of the following year for a chance to improve their grades. The change was brought in by the former Education Secretary Michael Gove with the intention of  making the exams more ""fit for purpose"" - or harder.  The new AS- and A-levels syllabuses have been phased in across schools in England from September 2015.  The DfE says: ""The content for the new A-levels has been reviewed and updated. Universities played a greater role in this for the new qualifications than they did previously."" The AS-level is being decoupled from the A-level, which means it operates as a stand-alone qualification and the results do not count towards A-level grades - although in Wales and Northern Ireland, they will still count towards an overall A-level mark.  Provisional figures from the Department for Education show that the number of entries for AS subjects has fallen by 42% this summer. Association of School and College Leaders general secretary Geoff Barton said it ""sounded the death knell for AS-levels"". ""The great benefit of the old system was that it gave students a broader range of knowledge and allowed them to keep their options open for longer,"" he said. ""The decision to decouple these qualifications was an entirely unnecessary reform, which is narrowing the curriculum and reducing student choice."" This year, new A-level qualifications were taken in: Next summer, candidates will sit the new A-level qualifications in the following subjects:  In the summer of 2019, new exams will be sat in: Young people and teachers have told the BBC that preparing for the new qualification has been stressful, especially as there were no past papers to refer to and some text books were written before some of the syllabuses were finalised. Rosamund McNeil, from the National Union of Teachers, said: ""The upheaval of a hastily reformed curriculum and the changes leading to a reduction in much of the coursework elements, created unnecessary stress and concern for pupils and teachers alike. ""While results nationally may have remained in line with those in the previous year, some schools and colleges will no doubt see considerable variation.  ""The volatility around results and the accountability measures which use them can have damaging and unfair consequences.""   There have been no major changes in the other nations. In Wales and Northern Ireland, AS-levels have remained as an integral part of studying for A-levels.  AS-levels contribute 40% of the total marks of the full A-level and can be taken at the end of the AS course or alongside A2. In Scotland, students do not sit A-levels and AS-levels. Instead, they take Highers and Advanced Highers. This year, the Higher pass rate dipped by 0.2%, but the total number of passes remained above 150,000 for a third successive year.

Volatility,Accused taxi driver 'tried to flee from police',2024-09-25,2023-06-08,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-65849782,"A taxi driver who was filmed pointing a suspected gun at a passenger allegedly tried to flee when police went to his home to arrest him, a court has heard. Brian Stalford, from Park Avenue in east Belfast, was detained after dashcam footage of the taxi incident was widely shared on social media. A small bag, packed with a ""sentimental photograph of his family"" was found at his home, a prosecution lawyer said. Mr Stalford denies the charges against him, claiming the video was a prank. At the High Court in Belfast on Thursday, his defence lawyers asked the judge to release him on bail.  The 48-year-old defendant is accused of possessing a firearm or an imitation firearm, common assault and making threats to kill during the taxi incident on 26 March. It has been alleged that he used the weapon to repeatedly threaten a passenger over a suspected drug debt in Holywood, County Down.  The dashcam video shows the accused dressed in a Fonacab taxi uniform, pointing the suspected gun at his front seat passenger's face and knees, the court heard. At one point, Mr Stalford is filmed striking the man in the face with the muzzle. But his defence lawyers have argued that the dashcam footage was a planned and consensual prank involving a toy gun. During Thursday's bail hearing, prosecutors claimed that in addition to trying to flee as he was arrested at his home earlier this month, Mr Stalford also got out of police car and ran from officers during a separate drug-related incident days earlier. He had previously been detained on 30 May, following the discovery of a small quantity of suspected drugs at his home. ""He was able to get out of the back of the PSNI car and run from police who had to pursue him,"" prosecution lawyer Natalie Pinkteron told the judge.  In addition to the charges related to the dashcam video, Mr Stalford is further accused of possessing drugs.  His defence barrister described the taxi incident as a ""bizarre set of circumstances"" which has caused public upset and embarrassment for his client. ""This was a video recorded with the consent of those involved,"" he insisted. ""It had been watched, shared and viewed a number of months ago, and the authorities accept there is confusion about how it was leaked beyond that group."" However, the prosecution had argued that both the front seat passenger and a second man in the rear of the taxi appeared to be shaken by Mr Stalford's actions. ""Neither of the other two men found what occurred funny,"" Ms Pinkteron said. ""It's entirely clear what Mr Stalford is telling male one to do - there's a debt that has to be paid. ""Given (the defendant) is saying he will take his head off or do his knees in, the inference is that it is a drug debt,"" Ms Pinkteron added. Stalford was sacked by Fonacab once the dashcam footage began to circulate on 1 June. ""He was then arrested… but when police arrived he immediately tried to flee out of his house,"" Ms Pinkteron told the court.  ""There was already a small bag packed with a sentimental photograph of his family."" After viewing the video clip, the judge said: ""The picture is one with clear elements of volatility, vulnerability, adverse mental health and limited self-control."" Denying bail, he ruled there was a ""clear and elevated risk"" that Mr Stalford could either re-offend, interfere with the investigation or flee."
Volatility,Oil prices rise as Saudi Arabia pledges output cuts,2024-09-25,2023-06-04,By Jemma Dempsey,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-65804768,"Oil prices have risen after Saudi Arabia said it would make cuts of a million barrels per day (bpd) in July. Other members of Opec+, a group of oil-producing countries, also agreed to continued cuts in production in an attempt to shore up flagging prices. Opec+ accounts for around 40% of the world's crude oil and its decisions can have a major impact on oil prices. In Asia trade on Monday, Brent crude oil rose by as much as 2.4% before settling at around $77 a barrel. Opec+ said production targets would drop by a further 1.4 million bpd from 2024. The seven hour-long meeting on Sunday of the oil-rich nations came against a backdrop of falling energy prices.  Oil prices soared when Russia invaded Ukraine last year, but are now back at levels seen before the conflict began. In October last year Opec+, a formulation which refers to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, agreed to cut production by two million bpd, about 2% of global demand. In April this year the group agreed to a further cuts, which were due to last to the end of this year. But Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said that Sunday's talks led to ""the extension of the deal until the end of 2024"". On Sunday, Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said that his country's cut of one million bpd could be extended beyond July if needed. ""This is a Saudi lollipop,"" he said, in what is seen as a bid to stabilise the market. Before the two-day Opec+ meeting started, it was widely expected the oil cartel would make production cuts to prop up prices. It appears most members were against the idea, as any cuts would impact oil revenues, which are crucial to keep running their economies.  Saudi Arabia's decision to make a voluntary reduction of one-million barrels per day was unexpected but does not come as a huge surprise. As the leader of the pack, and also the largest exporter of oil, it was the only one in a position to be able to lower output.  From Riyadh's point of view, it is crucial the price of crude remains over $80 a barrel for it to break even. Saudi officials want elevated prices to keep spending billions of dollars on ambitious projects spearheaded by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, as he tries to diversify the kingdom's economy away from oil. The move by the Saudis also underlines the uncertain outlook for demand for fuels in the months to come. Concerns about the global economy, especially recessionary fears in the US and Europe are expected to put further pressure on crude prices. Oil producers are grappling with falling prices and high market volatility amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The West has accused Opec of manipulating prices and undermining the global economy through high energy costs. It has also accused the group of siding with Russia despite sanctions over the invasion of Ukraine.   In response, Opec insiders have said the West's monetary policy over the last decade has driven inflation and forced oil-producing nations to act to maintain the value of their main export."
Volatility,Global watchdogs on alert as GameStop frenzy grows,2024-09-25,2021-01-29,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-55842994,"Regulators have fired warning shots over frenzied share dealing in GameShop and other firms fuelled by social media chat on sites like Reddit and Facebook. Watchdogs in the US and UK said they were monitoring activity and potential lawbreaking, and warned traders they risked facing huge losses. Traders should ensure they are familiar with all rules, ""including market abuse"", the UK's regulator said. GameStop is the focus of a trading war between amateurs and Wall Street pros. Shares in the US bricks-and-mortar video games retailer surged again on Friday, ending 68% higher. Another stock in the traders' sights, AMC Entertainment, jumped 54%. That bucked broader market trends, which saw all three main US indexes fall roughly 2%. For the week they were down more than 3% - the biggest weekly decline since October.  Some share trading firms temporarily halted dealings on Thursday amid extreme volatility in GameStop, which has soared as much as 700% in the past week. AMC Entertainment and Blackberry, which have also seen huge trading activity, were among the other companies also hit by the restrictions. UK traders have also been sharing their thoughts and tips on trading chat forums amid mounting concerns about misinformation and share ramping.  London-listed companies have also been the focus of social media attention, including publisher Pearson and cinema operator Cineworld, although the share price movements were minimal compared with the GameStop surge. In a statement on Friday, the UK's Financial Conduct Authority said: ""The FCA is aware of the situation and continues to closely monitor trading in UK markets. UK investors should take care when trading shares in highly volatile market conditions that they fully understand the risks they are taking. This applies to UK investors trading both US and UK stocks.   ""Firms and individuals should also ensure they are familiar with, and abiding by, all regulations including the market abuse and short selling regimes in the jurisdiction they are trading in."" In the US, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) warned against illegal ""manipulative trading activity"".  The regulator added: ""Our core market infrastructure has proven resilient under the weight of this week's extraordinary trading volumes. ""Nevertheless, extreme stock price volatility has the potential to expose investors to rapid and severe losses and undermine market confidence."" The SEC also said it would review actions that could ""unduly inhibit"" and ""disadvantage investors"". The war between amateur private investors and heavyweight firms like hedge funds centres on so-called short selling. Over recent months, hedge funds had made big bets that shares in loss-making GameStop would fall.  But an army of private investors, swapping tips on social media, spotted a chance for a buying frenzy that would push up the price and ""squeeze"" the hedge fund short sellers.  Many private traders made profits - and losses - along the way, but their actions also dealt a big financial blow to hedge funds that spent billions of dollars gambling GameStop's shares would tumble. The decision on Thursday by several brokerages to halt purchases of shares in Gamestop and some other firms  sparked outrage among investors, who accused the companies of working on behalf of traditional Wall Street investors who were losing out to the army of amateurs. Some disgruntled investors said they were preparing legal action. Investor anger over their temporary ban from trading spread beyond the investment community, with rappers and US politicians on both sides of the Washington divide joining the backlash against Wall Street. ""This is unacceptable,"" tweeted Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat. ""We now need to know more about @RobinhoodApp's decision to block retail investors from purchasing stock while hedge funds are freely able to trade the stock as they see fit."" Her tweet was shared by Republican Senator Ted Cruz who commented ""fully agree."" Tesla founder Elon Musk, whose shares have also been a retail favourite, also commented on Ms Ocasio-Cortez's tweet, saying ""Absolutely"". Much of the anger was directed atRobinhood, a new breed of broker popular among a new generation of younger, tech-savvy investor, but which has been accused of ""gamifying"" share trading.  On Friday, a Robinhood chat forum on Facebook was also removed for breaking its Community Standards rules, although the social media giant did not expand on the reasons. After the backlash, Robinhood late Thursday said it would ease the restrictions. The firm also said it had raised more than $1bn from existing investors to bolster its finances amid questions about strains caused by the buying frenzy. But Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat known as a supporter of tougher financial rules, said the chaos was another sign of ""years of distortion in securities markets that have allowed the wealthy few to artificially inflate and deflate share prices and reap short-term profits while exacerbating wealth inequality"". She said regulators must review the trades and make changes to ensure that markets ""reflect real value, rather than the highly leveraged bets of wealthy traders or those who seek to inflict financial damage on those traders"". Key to what's going on is ""short selling"" or ""shorting"", where a big investment firm such as a hedge fund tries to make money by betting that a company's share price will fall. The hedge fund borrows shares in a company from other investors (for a fee) and sells the shares on the markets at, for example, $10 each, waits until they fall to $5, and buys them back. The borrowed shares are returned to the original owner, and the hedge fund pockets a profit. GameStop - which saw heavy losses last year and was described as ""failing"" by one big investor - is the most shorted stock on Wall Street. But in the last week, amateur investors who follow the Wall Street Bets forum on Reddit have poured money into buying the company's stock with the aim of pushing up the price. If the price rises dramatically, short sellers face big losses and they need to buy back the shares they have borrowed quickly to prevent bigger losses - a process known as covering. However, buying back the shares only adds to demand for the stock and pushes its price higher still."
Volatility,What's knocked markets off course?,2024-09-25,2018-12-14,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46515773,"Just a few months ago, US financial markets seemed headed for a third year in a row of hefty increases. But shares have tumbled since October, retreating to lower levels than at the start of the year.  That decline continued on Friday, as weak economic data in Europe and China sparked a late afternoon sell-off, sending all three major US share indexes lower. The Nasdaq dropped almost 2.3%, the Dow fell 2% and the S&P 500 sank 1.9%. For those invested in US stocks, the double-digit gains in seven of the last 10 years may still feel pretty good. But as Wall Street debate turns to just when a recession might begin, many investors are bracing for a rough patch.  What's behind the shift in sentiment? At their peaks this year, the Dow and S&P 500 were up about 8% since the start of 2018. The Nasdaq had increased 15%. But the stock market surge was always a bit suspect. It outpaced other economic measures by a large margin and was driven by the tech sector, which accounted for roughly half of the gains on the S&P 500 up until mid-August of this year. Now some of the biggest winners - such as Apple and Facebook - have stumbled, dragging down the markets and making the weakness elsewhere more visible. All three indexes are off 10% from their earlier peaks - a decline often considered a correction. Until tech recovers, a broader market bounce is unlikely, said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at US Bank Wealth Management. ""Looking to 2019, volatility is likely to represent the norm rather than the exception,"" he says. ""By many measures, the degree of investment difficulty is on the rise.""  US central bankers have been raising interest rates since 2015, moving away from the unusually low rates put in place during the financial crisis as economic growth rebounds. Analysts are worried about how much more expensive borrowing might get - and whether companies and households will be able to handle the increased costs. Fears have been tempered recently by signals from the US Fed suggesting it may enact fewer rates rises in 2019 than previously expected. But some still worry about the risks from corporate debt levels, which have hit historic highs - with an increasing percentage of the loans made to companies with already large debt loads. US growth is expected to slow to 2.5% in 2019, down from about 3% this year, according to the IMF and Federal Reserve. Some closely watched industries and financial indicators are already flashing warning signs of a more serious contraction. In October, sales of existing homes had fallen more than 5% compared to 2017. Construction spending has started to slip and growth in consumer spending been less robust than expected. Meanwhile, business optimism is in retreat. Indeed, nearly half of US financial officers believe the nation's economy will enter a recession by the end of 2019, a recent Duke University survey found. Investors loved US President Donald Trump's 2017 tax cuts. But his trade policy has them tied up in knots. In March, Mr Trump ordered tariffs on foreign steel and aluminium, as well as on billions of dollars worth in annual trade from China. He's threatened more, including on foreign cars. The tariffs have already raised costs for US companies - and economists warn they threaten to slow growth, adding to recession worries. Markets aren't sure about White House strategy, and an ongoing investigation of Mr Trump's election campaign ties to Russia has only added to uncertainty emanating from Washington. ""If these investigations produce some sort of smoking gun that throws us into a constitutional crisis, that might prove destabilising,"" says Mark Vitner, senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities. The IMF expects the global economy to expand 3.7% in 2019, but the growth has become more uneven. The US Federal Reserve recently flagged issues in Europe, China and emerging markets as some of the biggest threats to the American economy, with Brexit high on the list. Indeed, as much as US indexes are down, financial markets elsewhere have dropped even farther.  The Global Dow is down around nearly 9% so far this year, and the MSCI world index is down about 8%. In Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 index has fallen about 6%; Hong Kong's Hang Seng index is about 13% lower in 2018. The Shanghai Composite has dropped more than 20%. The Stoxx Europe 600 is off almost 11%. France's CAC 40 has dropped almost 9%, London's FTSE 100 has declined nearly 11%. and Germany's DAX is down more than 15%. So stormy seas likely lie ahead."
Volatility,Tesla's Elon Musk faces investor lawsuit,2024-09-25,2018-08-11,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45155268,"Elon Musk's bombshell announcement that he is thinking of taking the electric car company Tesla private has landed him a lawsuit from unhappy investors.  The American entrepreneur said on Tuesday that de-listing from the stock exchange could be the ""best path forward"" for the firm.  His comments caused the share price to shoot up 11% to nearly $380 (£298), though it has since fallen back.  Short-sellers, who bet on share price falls, allege he misled the market.  Mr Musk, Tesla's founder and chief executive, announced that he might take the company private in a deal worth $72 billion, valuing the company at $420 a share.  However, he did not specify exactly where the money for such a deal, which would be the largest of its kind for more than a decade, would come from.  Mr Musk, who owns a fifth of the company, has complained previously about ""negative propaganda"" from short-sellers.  He said he hoped taking the firm private would protect Tesla from the distractions of share price volatility and pressure to meet quarterly financial targets.  Short-sellers, who make a profit by borrowing shares, selling them and then buying them back at an expected lower price, claim to have lost millions thanks to Mr Musk's comments.  Plaintiff Kalman Isaacs alleges the announcement was aimed at ""completely decimating"" short-sellers.  His lawsuit, and another filed by William Chamberlain, accuse Mr Musk and Tesla of violating federal securities laws and artificially inflating Tesla's share price.  Neither Mr Musk nor Tesla have commented on the lawsuit, which was filed in a federal court in San Francisco.  The tech entrepreneur is no stranger to controversy.   Only last month he was forced to apologise for insulting a British diver involved in rescuing a youth football team from a cave in northern Thailand. "
Volatility,Deal reached to give Manx Gas customers rebate,2024-09-25,2021-12-21,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-isle-of-man-59745576,"Manx Gas customers are set to receive a rebate on bills next year after the government reached a deal with the monopoly provider. Domestic and commercial users are set to be repaid at least £58 in February. It come after the government opted to reduce the firm's infrastructure payments by £1.4m, on the condition the savings are passed on to customers.     Cabinet Office Minister Kate Lord-Brennan said it was welcome news given bills were due to rise 27.5%. Manx Gas CEO Jo Cox said it was important the funds went ""directly"" to those impacted at a time of ""unprecedented and ongoing volatility"" in global markets. In October, Tynwald members agreed to allow for the a gas tariff increase so the company could meet the rising cost of wholesale gas. The company has since requested another review of its charges as its profits continue to fall. Repayments to gas customers were first raised during discussions over a new voluntary regulatory deal with Manx Gas, but talks collapsed earlier this year when politicians voted in favour of the creation of a statutory regulator. The rebate has now been made possible after the government agreed to adjust loans the gas provider holds with state-owned electricity and water authority Manx Utilities. Accounts held by the Isle of Man government will not receive the rebate. The announcement follows a separate pledge by Treasury to pay an additional £0.5m in winter fuel payments to support those affected by the increased gas tariffs.

Volatility,Investors wary as Kwarteng fast-tracks economic plan,2024-09-25,2022-10-10,By Daniel Thomas,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63129555,"The chancellor's decision to bring forward the date of his plan to balance the government's finances failed to reassure markets on Monday. Government borrowing costs rose sharply after Kwasi Kwarteng said he would fast-track his plan to 31 October. The plan will set out how he will fund tax cuts and reduce debt after his mini-budget sparked market turmoil. An independent forecast of the UK economy's prospects will be published at the same time. In the wake of the September mini-budget, the pound slumped to a record low, government borrowing costs surged and the Bank of England was forced to step in and take emergency action after the dramatic market movements put some pension funds at risk of collapse. The volatility eased but on Monday the yields - or effective interest rates - on UK government bonds were almost at the levels seen at the height of the market turmoil. Further efforts by the Bank of England to calm markets, along with the appointment of an experienced civil servant as Permanent Secretary to the Treasury also seemed to fall short.  Former Treasury chief Lord Macpherson warned the government that there could be an even tougher response from the financial markets in the coming weeks if the chancellor could not show his sums added up. ""Unless the government can restore economic credibility, the market response in the weeks ahead could be a whole lot worse than we've seen so far,"" he told the House of Lords.   Mr Kwarteng had initially said he would wait for 23 November to give details of his economic plan but faced mounting pressure from his MPs to change course. The new date means Mr Kwarteng's fiscal statement will be published before the Bank of England announces its latest decision on interest rates on 3 November.  The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is widely expected to raise interest rates for the eighth time since last December with many economists forecasting a sharper rise than previous increases.  But Mel Stride, chairman of the Treasury Select Committee, tweeted that he hoped Mr Kwarteng's decision to release the report earlier would result in a smaller rate rise.  He tweeted this would be ""critical to millions of mortgage holders"", Noting that that the plan will be published on Hallowe'en, Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner tweeted: ""Trick or cheat? The Tory horror show rattles on.""  The OBR, the independent budget watchdog, will now publish a report alongside Mr Kwarteng's statement at the end of October. Its forecasts will give an indication of the health of the nation's finances. By Dharshini David, BBC economics correspondent The chancellor bringing forward his explanation of how he intends to get down government debt and the official watchdog's assessment of his plans to Hallowe'en is aimed at quelling the market turmoil which has driven up borrowing costs for households and government.  Providing reassurance on that score will likely mean confirming unpalatable news for others. For most economists reckon that, even if the government can boost growth, it will realistically need to find savings of perhaps £40bn or more, if it is to bring down debt in a few years.  But by anyone's measure that's not small change, it's an amount greater than the defence budget, and won't be raised through efficiency savings. Many public services are already hampered by pandemic disruption and rising inflation. The Institute for Fiscal Studies reckons the latter means departments have to find £18bn from existing budgets just to provide planned services. On top of that balancing act, they'll be bracing for a new wave of austerity. Borrowers have faced paying the price for the markets' lack of faith in the government's plans - millions more may feel the cost of regaining it.  There was some confusion after the chancellor denied there had been any changes to the date of the fiscal statement. However, Treasury sources then clarified that the chancellor would, indeed, bring it forward and that it had simply been waiting to officially announce the change of date in Parliament. Since then the government has been forced into a series of embarrassing climbdowns under growing pressure from its own MPs. Last week, Mr Kwarteng scrapped a decision to cut the top rate of income tax.  And on Monday, James Bowler was announced as the new Permanent Secretary to the Treasury.  Ms Truss fired Sir Tom Scholar, the civil servant who previously held the job and planned to bring in a high profile outsider - a move some feared would further spook the markets.  Ms Truss still faces a potential rebellion from her MPs after declining to say whether she would increase benefits in line with inflation next April.  Her approval ratings have plummeted since the mini-budget. The prime minister says her tax cuts will boost the UK economy after years of lacklustre growth.   But there are fears the government will have to borrow huge sums to fill the spending gap. The cost of government borrowing consequently jumped, as investors demanded higher rates of interest on UK government bonds.  This has fed through to the mortgage market where hundreds of products were pulled due to concerns about how to price these long-term loans.  Last week, interest rates on typical two and five-year fixed rate mortgages topped 6% for the first time in over a decade. On Monday, the Bank of England announced measures to ensure an ""orderly end"" to an emergency bond buying scheme it was forced to launch after Mr Kwarteng pledged additional tax cuts on top of those outlined in the mini-budget. Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that the government and the Bank had launched ""a two pronged attempt to calm markets"" as the pound remained weak and government borrowing costs were rising again. ""Policymakers and politicians are clearly nervous about seeing a repeat of the mini-financial crisis unleashed following the presentation of the Truss administration's slash and spend plans,"" she said.  ""All eyes will be on the independent assessment of his spending plans, and the risk is that if the numbers don't add up, the markets could take fright again."""
Volatility,How the pandemic has changed the world economy,2024-09-25,2020-03-04,"By Lora Jones, Daniele Palumbo & David Brown ",https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51706225,"The coronavirus pandemic has reached almost every country in the world. Its spread has left national economies and businesses counting the costs, as governments struggle with new lockdown measures to tackle the spread of the virus.  Despite the development of new vaccines, many are still wondering what recovery could look like.  Here is a selection of charts and maps to help you understand the economic impact of the virus so far. Big shifts in stock markets, where shares in companies are bought and sold, can affect the value of pensions or individual savings accounts (Isas). The FTSE, Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nikkei all saw huge falls as the number of Covid-19 cases grew in the first months of the crisis. The major Asian and US stock markets have recovered following the announcement of the first vaccine in November, but the FTSE is still in negative territory. The FTSE dropped 14.3% in 2020, its worst performance since 2008. In response, central banks in many countries, including the UK, have slashed interest rates. That should, in theory, make borrowing cheaper and encourage spending to boost the economy. Some markets recovered ground in January this year, but this is a normal tendency known as the ""January effect"".  Analysts are worried that the possibility of further lockdowns and delays in vaccination programmes might trigger more market volatility this year. Many people have lost their jobs or seen their incomes cut. Unemployment rates have increased across major economies. In the United States, the proportion of people out of work hit a yearly total of 8.9%, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), signalling an end to a decade of jobs expansion. Millions of workers have also been put on government-supported job retention schemes as parts of the economy, such as tourism and hospitality, have come to a near standstill. The numbers of new job opportunities is still very low in many countries. Job vacancies in Australia have returned to the same level of 2019, but they are lagging in France, Spain, the UK and several other countries. Some experts have warned it could be years before levels of employment return to those seen before the pandemic. If the economy is growing, that generally means more wealth and more new jobs. It's measured by looking at the percentage change in gross domestic product, or the value of goods and services produced, typically over three months or a year. The IMF estimates that the global economy shrunk by 4.4% in 2020. The organisation described the decline as the worst since the Great Depression of the 1930s. The only major economy to grow in 2020 was China. It registered a growth of 2.3%. The IMF is, however, predicting global growth of 5.2% in 2021.  That will be driven primarily by countries such as India and China, forecast to grow by 8.8% and 8.2% respectively.  Recovery in big, services-reliant, economies that have been hit hard by the outbreak, such as the UK or Italy, is expected to be slow. The travel industry has been badly damaged, with airlines cutting flights and customers cancelling business trips and holidays. New variants of the virus - discovered only in recent months - have forced many countries to introduce tighter travel restrictions. Data from the flight tracking service Flight Radar 24 shows that the number of flights globally took a huge hit in 2020 and it is still a long way from recovery. The hospitality sector has been hit hard, with millions of jobs and many companies bankrupt. Data from Transparent - an industry-leading intelligence company that covers over 35 million hotel and rental listings worldwide - has registered a fall in reservations in all the top travel destinations. Billions of dollars have been lost in 2020 and although the forecast for 2021 is better, many analysts believe that international travel and tourism won't return to the normal pre-pandemic levels until around 2025. Retail footfall has seen unprecedented falls as shoppers stayed at home. New variants and surges in cases have made problems worse. Pedestrian numbers have fallen further from the first lockdown, according to research firm ShopperTrak,  Separate research suggests that consumers are still feeling anxious about their return to stores. Accountancy giant EY says 67% customers are now not willing to travel more than 5 kilometres for shopping.  This change in shopping behaviour has significantly boosted online retail, with a global revenue of $3.9 trillion in 2020. Governments around the world have pledged billions of dollars for a Covid-19 vaccine and treatment options. Shares in some pharmaceutical companies involved in vaccine development have shot up. Moderna, Novavax and AstraZeneca have seen significant rises. But Pfizer has seen its share price fall. The partnership with BioNTech, the high cost of production and management of the vaccine, and the growing number of same-size competitors have reduced the investors' trust in the company to have bigger revenue in 2021. A number of pharmaceutical firms have started already distributing doses and many countries have started their vaccination programmes. Many more - such as Johnson & Johnson and Sanofi/GSK - will join the vaccine distribution during 2021."
Volatility,Home asking prices see smallest February rise of £14,2024-09-25,2023-02-20,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-64703234,"The average asking price for a UK home rose by just £14 from January to February, according to property website Rightmove - the lowest increase for the month since its records began in 2001. The average asking price for a home is now £362,452, it said. Asking prices normally rise at the start of the year as sellers gear up for the spring selling season. However, price tags do fluctuate at other times in a year. For example in November and December, they decreased. Rightmove said higher mortgage rates and living costs were squeezing what people could afford. It follows months of falling house prices and predictions of further declines this year and next.  ""Many sellers are breaking with tradition and showing unseasonal initial pricing restraint,"" Tim Bannister, Rightmove's director of property science, said of the latest figures.  He added buyers were taking more time to ""find the right property at the right price"" and wanted ""greater realism on price"". Up until January house prices in the UK fell for five months in a row, according to building society Nationwide.  Meanwhile annual house price growth slowed to 1.1%, down from 2.8% in December. Rightmove said the rise in asking prices seen this February was lower than the growth of 0.6% recorded during the 2008 financial crisis. Part of the reason is higher mortgage rates, which have squeezed purchasing power. Rates have fallen from the 6.65% highs seen after Liz Truss's mini-budget in September but remain far above what they were a year ago. According to research firm Moneyfacts, average two-year and five-year fixed rate mortgages are still above 5%.  At the same time inflation - the rate at which prices rise - is near a 40-year high, putting pressure on household budgets.  Despite this, Rightmove said buyers were benefiting from ""more choice albeit with revised budgets to accommodate higher mortgage rates"". The company said the number of sales agreed was rebounding, but was still 11% down on 2019 levels. They had been down 30% during the aftermath of the mini-budget. And Tom Bill, head of UK residential research at estate agent Knight Frank, said the housing market had picked up a bit since Christmas.  ""Buyers and sellers switched off early for the holidays due to the volatility caused by the mini-budget but have come back surprisingly strongly in 2023,"" he said. Knight Frank expects house prices to fall by about 5% this year as household budgets come under pressure.  The Office for Budget Responsibility, the government's official forecaster, has predicted a 9% drop in prices through to Autumn 2024 before prices start to rise again."
Volatility,FTX founder Bankman-Fried denied bail in Bahamas,2024-09-25,2022-12-14,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-63967010,"Sam Bankman-Fried, founder of the failed cryptocurrency exchange FTX, has been denied bail by a judge in the Bahamas. US authorities charged Mr Bankman-Fried with ""one of the biggest financial frauds in US history"" on Tuesday. The ex-FTX boss built a ""house of cards on a foundation of deception,"" Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler said. Mr Bankman-Fried has indicated that he will fight extradition to the US. Bahamas Chief Magistrate JoyAnn Ferguson-Pratt denied the petition for his release on bail, citing a ""great"" risk of flight, and ordered that he be kept on remand at a correctional facility until 8 February. He was arrested in the Bahamas on Monday.  Last month, FTX filed for bankruptcy in the US, leaving many users unable to withdraw their funds. According to a court filing, FTX owed its 50 largest creditors almost $3.1bn (£2.5bn). Among the most serious allegations against Mr Bankman-Fried is that he used billions of dollars of customer funds to prop up his investment trading company, Alameda. It is unclear how much people who have funds in the exchange will get back at the end of bankruptcy proceedings - though many experts have warned it may be a small fraction of what they deposited. Mr Bankman-Fried faces eight criminal charges in the US, including wire fraud, money laundering and conspiracy to defraud. He also faces civil charges including misleading investors who put more than $1bn into the company. Officials have also accused him of violating campaign finance laws.  At a news conference on Tuesday, Damian Williams, the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York, described the fraud Mr Bankman-Fried is accused of as among the largest in US history.  Besides accusing Mr Bankman-Fried of defrauding lenders, investors and customers, Mr Williams alleged he had used ""tens of millions"" in ill-gotten gains for illegal campaign contributions to Democrats and Republicans alike.  ""All this dirty money was used in service of Bankman-Fried's desire to buy bipartisan influence and impact the direction of public policy in Washington,"" Mr Williams said.  In previous media interviews, the crypto tycoon has admitted to mistakes, but denied intent to defraud his customers. Mr Bankman-Fried also denied allegations he must have been aware that FTX's affiliated trading company, Alameda Research, was using FTX customer funds. He was once viewed as a young version of legendary US investor Warren Buffett. As recently as late October, he had a net worth estimated at more than $15bn (£12.1bn). Meanwhile, the firm's new chief executive, John Ray, told a US congressional committee that FTX's collapse appeared to be the result of it being controlled by a small group of ""grossly inexperienced, non-sophisticated individuals"". He said he had seen ""an utter lack of record-keeping - no internal controls whatsoever"". The FTX exchange allowed customers to trade normal money for cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. Cryptocurrencies are not currencies in the traditional sense, but are stored online and act more like investment vehicles or securities - often with a high degree of volatility. Their anonymity means they have been favoured for criminal activities such as drug dealing and ransomware attacks, but their supporters say there is huge potential for innovation - and independence from governments."
Volatility,Hard hat warning for Scottish construction,2024-09-25,2018-06-28,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-44639798,"The good news about Scotland's economic performance in the first three months of the year is that things are better, by the narrowest of margins, than in the UK as a whole.  The bad news is that things in the UK-as-a-whole are getting worse. Thus, the story of Scotland's economy continues to be one of comparison with its nearest neighbours, when there are bigger and tougher targets to be hit. There have been signs that Scotland's economy was beginning to pick up a bit, from a long, stale period. It now looks like the uptick is being pulled back by weakness in its biggest ""export"" market. Bad weather from January to March, and the chill winds of Brexit uncertainty, look to be the more likely culprits.  The weather changes. Brexit barely does.  The uncertainty surrounding it is becoming more of an acute problem, if business messaging is any guide. With better weather, construction workers can get back to work (though this week, they should be wearing sunscreen).  Despite representing less than 7% of the economy, their woes have been one of the main drivers of recent trends in output from the total economy. Construction output was down 3.5% between the first quarter of 2018 and the previous quarter, and down 9.2% on the start of last year. A year-on-year fall could be seen across the UK, but at -2.7%, it was far smaller.  As pointed out by John McLaren, the economist who runs the Scottish Trends website, the three-year comparison shows a 7.3% decline in Scotland and 7.5% growth across the UK.  The difference is nearly 15%. The latest figures represent nine consecutive quarters of decline for Scotland's construction sector. That's partly because the industry has been winding down big infrastructure projects - from the Queensferry Crossing to the big central Scotland motorway projects. It hasn't found sufficient replacements, either from the budget-constrained public sector or from private firms. John McLaren's analysis looks also at the figures from the Office for National Statistics - compiled in a different way, but giving some more detail of what may be going on in the construction sector. A drop of 11% (compared with -3% for the UK) takes output back to the place it was three years ago. ""This suggests there may be yet more to come in terms of falling Scottish construction output,"" says Scottish Trends. ""New infrastructure work has fallen to almost half the level of the peak seen in the second half of 2015. New public work is at its lowest level in almost four years, and new private commercial work has fallen to its lowest level in almost five years."" Another key measure highlighted is that Gross Domestic Product (total output) per head in Scotland has gone nowhere in the past three years, while there has been very modest growth of 1% in that measure across the UK. However, what McLaren also does is to devise his own measure of economic health, by stripping out the bits that cause the most volatility. That includes construction. The so-called ""active economy"" - manufacturing and non-financial private sector services - has seen growth of 2% between the start of 2017 and early 2018. The improvement in the fortunes of the offshore oil and gas industry can take some of the credit. Yet another measure that tells us something about the state of the economy is the relatively new measure, commissioned by the Scottish government, of consumer sentiment.  Comparing positive outlooks with negative, the balance has been to the gloomy downside in each quarter since the Brexit referendum. With households so downbeat, and with pay still barely growing, consumer demand is not strong. So what is being done about this? While the Downing Street cabinet seems to be debating whether the economic and business impact of Brexit is worth bothering about (Boris Johnson is reported to have put it a lot more bluntly), Scotland has a new economic secretary, and one with a lot more on his plate than Keith Brown. Derek Mackay has quite a fiefdom, across income tax powers to business rates reform, council tax and the economy brief. He may take some time to learn new parts of the brief. So it's probable that he signed off the same wording in response to the 0.2% first quarter growth that we might have heard from Keith Brown.   ""Scotland's economy is strong..."" it began.  No harm in talking it up, of course. But if the new cabinet secretary with responsibility for boosting growth can't grasp that the figures are actually weak, then this week's reshuffle and ""refresh"" won't have achieved much on the economic front."
Volatility,Oil's up: What does it mean?,2024-09-25,2018-04-24,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-43886953,"There's no magic price for oil at which investment is switched off or on, depending on the direction of travel. Investment depends on each project and its break-even point, and no two oil fields are the same - least of all those that require drilling offshore. But at $75 a barrel, and on an upward trend, this seems a milestone at which to catch some breath and ask a) what's going on with the market for Brent crude? And b) what are the implications? So first, what's going on? That's simple, perhaps deceptively so. It's about our old friends, supply and demand. The latter is rising with economic growth, notably in Asia, but around the world.  Growth is not as closely aligned to demand for oil as it once was. But in India, for instance, development means a big boost to industrial production, demand for electricity and transport. Symbolic of India's economic position, Saudi Arabia announced this month it is investing big in a refinery and petro-chemicals complex on a beach resort south of Mumbai. Ratnagiri will be one of the world's largest, processing 1.2 million barrels per day.  Saudi Aramco (state-owned while aiming to float) is taking a 50% stake in the £32bn ($44bn) project, while a consortium of state-owned energy firms in India own the other half. Supply is a more complex picture.  American stocks of oil influence the market, and the official numbers are expected to show they've fallen. That puts upward pressure on the price. More significant in the longer term, the Opec exporters' cartel, working with non-member Russia, has been holding back on production in order to pull the price up. Saudis are among those straining at the loss of market share, particularly to Americans.  The market gyrated a bit last week when the Saudi oil minister said the rising price didn't seem to be doing much harm to demand, so he reckoned out loud that oil at $80 to $100 might be a possible sustainable target zone.  The Saudi government has, remember, a war to fight. And hostilities with Yemen, partially as a proxy for Iran, are one of the reasons for markets being nervous about security of supply. The Straits of Hormuz are an oil supply choke point which could also be a flash point between Saudi and Iran. After the Saudi minister had hinted, Russia's energy minister counter-hinted that the constraints might come off the cartel, which would push the price down again. His comments did precisely that. America is the most dynamic part of the supply story, for two main reasons. Fracking technology extracts oil and gas for a limited period before new rock has to be fractured. It's a repeated process, and if, as in 2014-15, the price drops, the process is stopped. Only when the price rises again does fracking restart. That's what is happening. America is producing more oil now than ever. The other unpredictable dynamic sits in the Oval Office. Donald Trump wants to break from the Iran nuclear deal, which would involve a return to sanctions on Tehran's oil exports - that is, a cut in its supply into the world market.  The US president tweeted last Friday: ""Looks like OPEC is at it again. With record amounts of Oil all over the place, including the fully loaded ships at sea, Oil prices are artificially Very High! No good and will not be accepted!"" That, Mr President, is absolutely correct. Controlling supply and prices is precisely what cartels exist to do. That's the point of Opec.  And though oil prices may look too high from Washington DC, they probably don't look too high in mid-Texas or the Dakotas. ""No good"" for oil users, but very good for oil producers. And when you say this ""will not be accepted"", we look forward, nervously, to finding out if this is another threat of trade war. Put all that together, and the price of a barrel of oil delivered in three months has risen from a low below $30 at the start of 2016 to 150% more than that. However, the current price remains 43% below the peak in 2014. So what does it mean? Higher fuel prices? Well, not necessarily. At the same time the oil price, measured in US dollars, has been rising, the US dollar itself has been weakening against sterling. If like me, you'll find currencies easiest to understand by thinking of travelling abroad. If you want to vacation in America now, you'll be able to buy 12 more dollars for £100 than you could a year ago.  The same goes for dollar-denominated oil. A year ago, a pound bought you $1.28 on currency markets (without all those transaction charges). It now buys $1.40. That is, the pound buys 9% more in dollars than it did last year. The other factor is that UK forecourt prices have a lot to do with tax rates. VAT runs at 20%, so it is as volatile as the price. For heating fuel, VAT is 5%. Fuel duty for transport is fixed, currently sitting at 58p per litre. Take all that together, and the AA's price-monitoring tells us that the average price of a litre of unleaded fuel, at pumps across the UK, rose 1p between December and March, while diesel fell by 1p. For Scotland in particular, it's worth watching for three different effects. One is the risk of rising oil prices boosting costs for those who use fuel, in homes and in businesses. For those reasons around sterling, there's no sign of inflation resulting yet. But where economies are already doing well, analysts are concerned that the rising price of Brent crude could push up prices more widely. The other side of the coin in Scotland is the industry that extracts oil. Investment decisions have to take big gambles on the future price of Brent crude. In general, business plans don't like volatility or heightened uncertainty. It comes at a cost. They prefer to see a reasonably stable price and a market environment which looks like continuing that for the foreseeable. They don't have that yet, but they'll like the upward trend for more than two years. After a very harsh downturn, with the price slump from September 2014, much of the offshore industry has stabilised. It has a number of big final investment decisions - the gateway or green light for a project - which are helped by raised prices and an upward trend. Oil and Gas UK, the trade body, reckoned at the start of the year that at least 12 major investment projects were expected to be approved during 2018, worth around £5bn. So if there's more profit, there ought to be more tax revenue? Correct. But how much more?  Not as much as you would have found with other price revivals, because the UK Treasury has cut tax rates. The main tax take is at 30% of profits. The Supplementary Charge was cut in 2016 from 20% to 10%. And the Petroleum Revenue Tax rate, levied on profits from older fields, was cut from 35% to zero. The Office for Budget Responsibility last month raised its estimate of what the tax take might be as a result of the rising price, as it has had to do repeatedly.  It was a sharp increase, but to a level that remains low by previous standards - up from £500m this year to £900m.  Tax revenue from oil and gas is expected to average under £1bn annually for the five years of its forecast, which assumes the price of oil and of gas will fall again in the later three years. Production and profits are then expected to continue their decline. For the purposes of arguing the case for Scottish independence, a geographic share of that tax revenue is dwarfed by the scale of the public sector deficit calculated by Scottish government statisticians in their annual expenditure and revenue tables. Likewise, for those who want a national oil fund, less than a billion pounds per year might be nice to have but wouldn't go far.  That said, they are brave people who stick their necks out with assumptions about the oil price five years ahead. Sometimes, however, economic forecasters have nowhere to hide."
Volatility,"Bitcoin peaks at new high close to $20,000",2024-09-25,2020-12-01,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-55145444,"Bitcoin has traded at its highest value to date, reaching $19,920.53 (£14,821) according to data-provider Coindesk. It took the virtual currency nearly three years to top its previous record, when it peaked about $137 lower. Bitcoin has risen in value by more than 170% since the start of the year. Analysts suggest some investors have treated it as a ""safe haven asset"" at a time of uncertainty caused by the coronavirus pandemic, but others warn that it remains volatile. Bitcoin fell below $3,300 at one point after reaching its previous high. And even this Tuesday, it briefly dipped below $18,300 a couple of hours after setting its new record. Other factors that have supported its recent rise include PayPal allowing its platform to be used to buy and sell the virtual coins in October, and a number of large institutional investors declaring interest in buying into funds tied to the crypto-currency. These include Guggenheim Partners, a Wall Street firm that announced on Friday it might put as much as $530m into a Bitcoin-related investment trust. ""It seems that barely a day goes past when we don't read a headline about a mainstream fund or company expressing an intention to put some of their holdings into Bitcoin,"" said Rhian Lewis, author of The Cryptocurrency Revolution. ""Price predictions are notorious for being wrong, so it's entirely likely there will be more dips and volatility.  ""But this time it feels very different from the 2017 high - there seems to be more real demand, and the narrative is more measured."" She added that another factor was that investors are concerned that central bank efforts to deal with Covid-19 will fuel inflation. Gold and other precious metals are traditionally used to hedge against such a risk. But because in theory only a limited amount of Bitcoin can ever be created - it was designed to only let 21 million bitcoins be produced, of which about 18.6 million already exist - some favour it as an alternative. If it does climb higher there could be sudden drops in value, however, as some traders will have set automatic sell orders pegged to it reaching the $20,000 mark. One expert warned members of the public to be careful. ""Never invest money you can't afford to lose,"" said finance and economics writer Frances Coppola. ""Bitcoin is a speculative asset and has a history of sudden crashes. It's not worth risking your house or your life savings for it. ""And borrowing to invest in Bitcoin or other crypto-currencies is a bad idea unless you are a professional trader."" Bitcoin is often referred to as a new kind of currency. But it may be best to think of its units being virtual tokens rather than physical coins or notes. However, like all currencies its value is determined by how much people are willing to exchange it for. To process Bitcoin transactions, a procedure called ""mining"" must take place, which involves a computer solving a difficult mathematical problem with a 64-digit solution. For each problem solved, one block of Bitcoins is processed. In addition the miner is rewarded with new Bitcoins. This provides an incentive for people to provide computer processing power to solve the problems. To compensate for the growing power of computer chips, the difficulty of the puzzles is adjusted to ensure a steady stream of new Bitcoins are produced each day. To receive a Bitcoin, a user must have a Bitcoin address - a string of 27-34 letters and numbers - which acts as a kind of virtual post-box to and from which the Bitcoins are sent. Since there is no register of these addresses, people can use them to protect their anonymity when making a transaction. These addresses are in turn stored in Bitcoin wallets, which are used to manage savings. They operate like privately run bank accounts - with the proviso that if the data is lost, so are the Bitcoins owned."
Volatility,New York Stock Exchange trading floor reopens,2024-09-25,2020-05-26,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-52803390,"The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) has reopened its trading floor after a two-month closure due to the coronavirus pandemic. But as new social distance rules come into effect, the exchange looks and feels very different. The NYSE is one of the few bourses to still feature floor trade - most have shifted to fully-electronic trading. New York City has been hit hard by the outbreak with some 200,000 cases and more than 20,000 deaths. Financial markets have continued to trade throughout the pandemic, but the exchange's trading floor was closed from 23 March and activity temporarily moved to fully-electronic trading to protect workers. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo was on hand to ring the bell that re-started in-person trade, a sign of the symbolic weight attached to the reopening. US shares gained on Tuesday amid investor enthusiasm about economic rebound, but the new NYSE rules are a reminder that a full return to business will take time. ""It's not about returning to normal,"" NYSE president Stacey Cunningham told the BBC. ""It's about living with this global pandemic until there's a vaccine."" She added that she had faced ""no pressure"" from the Trump administration, which follows financial markets closely and has generally supported a rapid reopening.  Under the NYSE changes, only a quarter of the normal number of traders will be allowed to return to work. Traders must also avoid public transport, wear masks and follow strict social distancing rules, with newly fitted transparent barriers to keep people apart. They will also be screened and have their temperatures taken as they enter the building. Anyone who fails pass the check will be barred until they test negative for coronavirus or self-quarantine in accordance with US government guidelines. To return to their jobs, floor traders also have to sign a liability waiver that prevents them from suing the NYSE if they get infected at the exchange.  Some large financial companies, such as Morgan Stanley, have reportedly balked at signing, but Ms Cunningham defended the waiver as a way to ensure that traders, which are not employed by the exchange, abide by the new rules.  ""We need to make sure that they're committed to following this new norm,"" she said. NYSE, which is owned by Intercontinental Exchange, is the world's largest stock exchange in terms of the total market capitalisation of listed companies. The 228-year-old exchange last closed its doors on 29 October 2012 due to Hurricane Sandy. It also shut for four sessions in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001.  But the bourse resisted closing at the start of the pandemic and the closure reignited debate about the necessity of the floor in an era dominated by electronic activity. Ms Cunningham said trading has functioned smoothly with the floor closed, but she believed reopening will further ease volatility and help smaller firms that rely on in-person trades for their business. ""We are relevant we are necessary and WE ARE BACK,"" floor trader Peter Tuchman wrote on Twitter ahead of the reopening. For most people outside the financial world, NYSE's trading floor is a rare glimpse into the seemingly opaque workings of the global markets as well as being a colourful setting for companies to showcase their stock market debuts. The new regulations mean that the NYSE's high-profile opening bell events and stock market debut celebrations have been put on hold as visitors are banned. Media organisations that usually broadcast from the trading floor won't be allowed back until further notice. In the BBC interview, Ms Cunningham also addressed a proposal by US lawmakers to require companies that sell shares in the US to abide by American accounting rules and audits, or face de-listing.  The move, which comes as US-China tensions increase, is aimed at Chinese companies. The Senate passed the measure last week and the House is expected to take up the measure before the end of the summer.  Ms Cunningham in the past has said de-listing Chinese companies generally would simply shift their business elsewhere.  On Tuesday, she said lawmakers should ""balance"" investor protections and investor choice, but that the exchange backs efforts that would enhance the information supplied to investors. ""Any measures to enforce that are highly supported by us,"" she said. Trading - but not as we know it Analysis by Samira Hussain, BBC reporter New York Before the coronavirus, I was a regular on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.  It may be one of the great symbols of US capitalism, but it's also, just a workplace for hundreds of traders, market makers, and various bystanders such as journalists. And like so many offices and shop floors it's not somewhere that you would ever associate with social distancing, keeping two metres apart and wearing masks. Quite the reverse - face-to-face stock trading is sometimes close to a contact sport, as is reporting from the floor.  So the NYSE has to take its reopening very slowly. It will be a relief for some traders to be back to work, but it's not going to look like the trading floor we're all used to seeing for quite some time."
Volatility,US banks report gains but shares sink,2024-09-25,2018-04-13,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-43758938,"Profits at JP Morgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo rose in the first three months of the year, but their shares slumped on Friday despite the gains. JP Morgan's profits soared 35% year-on-year, with more modest increases reported at Citigroup and Wells Fargo. Analysts said the share decline was a sign investors had already factored in some of the rise. They were expecting more active stock markets and a lower tax rate to boost results. Shares in all three banks sank more than 2% in early trading, providing a sour start to earnings season, when companies report quarterly performance to investors.  JP Morgan reported profits of $8.7bn (£6.11bn) in the period from $6.4bn last year, despite a decline in investment banking. Revenue increased 10% to $28.5bn, as a strong economy boosted activity at its consumer banking unit and the return of market fluctuations boosted trading, leading its equities unit to a record quarter. Citigroup's profits rose 13%, reaching $4.6bn in the quarter from $4.1bn last year.  Revenues in the quarter were $18.4bn, a 3% increase from the same period in 2017. The firm said volatility boosted its equity trading unit, helping to offset a fall in bond trading. As with JP Morgan, investment banking took a hit. Wells Fargo reported preliminary profits of $5.9bn in the quarter, rising 5% from the same period last year. The results were overshadowed by the firm's ongoing problems with watchdogs. Wells said US regulators have proposed to resolve investigations of vehicle insurance and might force it to restate its results. ""At this time, we are unable to predict final resolution ... and cannot reasonably estimate our related loss contingency,"" the bank said. The firm has been under a cloud since revelations that the bank created more than two million fake accounts to meet sales goals and ignored or punished whistleblowers. Then last year, the bank said it had wrongly charged customers for car insurance, among other problems.  In February, the US Federal Reserve, which regulates banks, said it would restrict the firm's growth until it improved its risk management oversight. Revenue slipped from $22.3bn in the first quarter of 2017 to $21.9bn this period, hurt in part by ""customer-friendly"" changes the bank made to card and overdraft fees. "
Volatility,Global bank stocks slump despite Biden reassurances,2024-09-25,2023-03-12,By Daniel Thomas & Natalie Sherman,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-64935170,"Bank shares in Asia and Europe have slumped, despite reassurances from the US president that America's financial system is safe following the collapse of two US lenders. The falls come after authorities moved to protect customer deposits when the US-based Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank collapsed.  Joe Biden promised to do ""whatever is needed"" to protect the banking system. But investors fear other lenders may still be hit by the fallout. On Tuesday, Japan's Topix Banks share index fell by more than 7%, putting it on course for its worst day in more than three years. Shares of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, the country's largest lender by assets, were down by 8.1% in mid-day Asian trading.  On Monday, Spain's Santander and Germany's Commerzbank saw their share prices dive by more than 10% at one point.  A string of smaller US banks suffered even worse losses than European counterparts, despite reassuring customers that they had more than enough liquidity to protect themselves from shocks.  The volatility has led to speculation that America's Federal Reserve will now pause its plans to keep raising interest rates, designed to tame inflation. Mr Biden said that people and businesses that had deposited money with Silicon Valley Bank would be able to access all their cash from Monday, after the government stepped in to protect their deposits in full.  Many business customers had faced the prospect of not being able to pay staff and suppliers after their funds were frozen. BBC North America Technology correspondent James Clayton spoke to people queuing up all day outside the SVB branch in Menlo Park, California, to access their funds. As the bank was no longer offering wire transfers, they were taking out their money in cashier cheques.  Silicon Valley Bank - which specialised in lending to technology companies - was shut down by US regulators who seized its assets on Friday. It was the biggest failure of a US bank since the financial crisis in 2008. It had been trying to raise money to plug a loss from the sale of assets affected by higher interest rates. Word of the troubles led customers to race to withdraw funds, leading to a cash crisis.  Authorities on Sunday also took over Signature Bank in New York, which had many clients involved in crypto and was seen as the institution most vulnerable to a similar bank run. Mr Biden promised that covering the deposits would not cost taxpayers anything, and instead be funded by fees regulators charge to banks. As part of efforts to restore confidence, US regulators also unveiled a new way for banks to borrow emergency funds in a crisis.  Yet there is concern that the failures, which came after the collapse of another US lender, Silvergate Bank, last week, are a sign of troubles at other firms.  Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics said the US authorities had ""acted aggressively to prevent a contagion developing"". ""But contagion has always been more about irrational fear, so we would stress that there is no guarantee this will work,"" he added. Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at the stockbrokers AJ Bell, said: ""The first rush of relief has been replaced by niggling concerns that the era of high rates might be more difficult for some banks to stomach than had been previously thought.  ""In the US, bank stocks slid despite Joe Biden's pledge that 'whatever is needed' will be carried out to prevent more dominos from tumbling.""  The failure of SVB has re-ignited debates - similar to those seen following the 2008 financial crisis - about how much the government should do to regulate and protect banks. The chair of the US Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, says there will be a thorough and transparent review of the collapse. Mr Biden called for tougher rules and emphasised that investors and bank leaders would not be spared. ""They knowingly took a risk... that's how capitalism works,"" he said. Still, Republican Senator Tim Scott, seen as a potential presidential candidate in 2024, called the rescue ""problematic"". ""Building a culture of government intervention does nothing to stop future institutions from relying on the government to swoop in after taking excessive risks,"" he said. Once again people are worried about banks. Once again there is intense debate about bailouts. But this isn't 2008. Following the global financial crisis, the focus was on reforming banks considered ""too big to fail"". Today's problems are centred around medium- and smaller-sized banks.   Both of the banks that collapsed - Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank - had the same thing in common: their business models were too concentrated in one sector and they were over exposed to assets whose values came under pressure from rising interest rates.  The criticism is that they should have foreseen this and they didn't. US Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has gone to great lengths to signal the Fed's intention to raise interest rates. Since most banks are well diversified and have plenty of cash on hand, the assumption is that the risk to the rest of the banking sector is low. That won't stop regulators looking into what went wrong and what rules need to change.  And the pressure on small- and medium-sized banks hasn't gone away. What happens to the US economy and the fight against inflation also remains to be seen."
Volatility,Crypto-currencies gaining popularity in Kenya,2024-09-25,2019-02-22,By Mary-Ann Russon,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-47307575,"Interest in virtual currencies is rising across the African continent, especially in Kenya, Africa's Silicon Valley. Despite warnings from Kenya's central bank about the volatility of crypto-currencies, some businesses in Nairobi are now accepting Bitcoin payments. The total number of Bitcoin transactions in Kenya are estimated to be worth over $1.5m, according to the Blockchain Association of Kenya. But can the technology really take off? Crypto-currencies are virtual money that can be used to pay for things in the real world, such as a hotel room, food or even a house. Digital tokens are held in online wallets, and can be sent anonymously between users. Crypto-currencies run on a technology called blockchain - a ledger of blocks of information, such as transactions or agreements, that are stored across a network of computers. The information is stored chronologically and is designed to be de-centralised and tamper-proof. While this provides security, it also means there is no oversight from a central authority such as a bank or a government. The first-ever blockchain-backed currency developed was Bitcoin, and it continues to be the most widely-used globally. At the moment, the crypto-currencies Bitcoin, Dash and Lisk are used in Botswana, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa and Zimbabwe. Blockchain is also being implemented by start-ups and tech conglomerates alike in Kenya to help solve problems, such as IBM's platform to help small businesses to prove their creditworthiness for loans.  Tony Mwongera, the chief executive of Healthland Spa in Nairobi, began accepting Bitcoin payments in 2018. ''I decided to adopt the use of crypto-currencies because there was so much theft in my business,"" he told the BBC. ""So I said, let me use a way that can be safe, secure and I can also embrace technology."" Healthland Spa customers told the BBC that they like the convenience of using crypto-currencies to pay for purchases.  However, if you look at the total number of people in Kenya using virtual currencies today, it is still relatively small - only about 40,000 people have ever made a transaction using Bitcoin. Part of the reason crypto-currency penetration isn't growing that much is because Kenya's central bank has forbidden banks from dealing in virtual currencies. Banks are not allowed to open accounts for people who are known to dealing in any virtual currency, which means that the population cannot easily convert Bitcoin payments into cash or mobile money. ""Crypto-currencies can facilitate and ensure that you do an unlimited number of transactions, however the volatility, lack of control and the non-acceptability of crypto-currencies across different jurisdictions impairs what you'd expect a currency to do,"" economist and policy expert Vincent Kimosop told the BBC.  The Blockchain Association of Kenya (BAK) disagrees with this way of thinking, and it is actively working to educate the country on the benefits of using crypto-currencies and blockchain.  The non-profit body says that using virtual currencies can greatly reduce the cost of transactions, and enable people without bank accounts to quickly make and receive payments. According to BAK, there are many things Kenyans have realised they can use Bitcoin for - whether it is to pay merchants in China for goods, or to enable Nigerians to pay to send their children to school in Kenya, or to enable young African freelancers to be easily paid for their work online.

Volatility,Google owner Alphabet misses forecasts,2024-09-25,2019-04-29,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48099862,"Google's parent company, Alphabet, saw its shares drop in after-hours trading after the internet giant missed revenue forecasts. Alphabet, which also owns YouTube, reported $36.3bn (£28bn) in sales for the first quarter, below expectations of $37.33bn. Profits also fell during the three months to 31 March. It was impacted by a fine from the European Commission for blocking rival online search advertisers. Google had to pay €1.5bn (£1.3bn) after it was accused of abusing its market dominance by restricting third-party competitors from displaying search adverts between 2006 and 2016. Including the fine, Alphabet's operating profit dropped to $6.6bn from a previous $7.6bn. Sales growth slowed to 17% in the first three months of the year, below the expansion rate of the previous three months and down from a 26% increase in the same period last year. Alphabet's share price dropped nearly 7% in after-hours trading.  Alphabet also said that the rate of growth in ""paid clicks"" decelerated, slowing to 39% growth compared to 59% at the beginning of 2018. Under the model, companies pay a fee each time one of their adverts is clicked on.   Alphabet chief financial officer Ruth Porat said the firm was experimenting with its ad products as users grow reliant on mobile devices and that it was seeing revenue volatility as a result.  The majority of the firm's revenues (84.5%) came from Google's ad business, which sells links, banners and commercials across its own websites and apps and those of partners. Google's three billion users help make it the world's largest seller of internet ads, according to market research firm EMarketer.  George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""Another EU fine won't have washed well with investors, but in reality it's not the cheque on its way to Brussels that's causing the shares to drop. ""Instead, it's a nasty combination of growth in traffic to Google ads slowing and lower revenue per click from those ads that's upset the market."" "
Volatility,Musk warns Twitter deal stuck without spam proof,2024-09-25,2022-05-17,By Tom Espiner,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-61432483,"Elon Musk has said his $44bn deal to buy Twitter may be in jeopardy due to a disagreement over the number of fake accounts on the social media platform. Mr Musk tweeted that the deal ""cannot move forward"" unless Twitter backs up its claims that less than 5% of daily users are fake or spam accounts. Twitter has defended its figures, adding that Mr Musk waived rights to ""due diligence"" to clinch the deal. The spat has raised doubts about the takeover. Analysts have speculated that Mr Musk may be looking for ways to renegotiate the price of the deal or walk away. Mr Musk agreed the $44bn (£34.5bn) deal to buy Twitter with its board in April, but last week Mr Musk said the deal was ""on hold"" while he sought details about fake accounts. He has continued to press the issue in tweets and public appearances, while also hinting that he could seek a lower price. On Tuesday, Mr Musk said Twitter boss Parag Agrawal had ""publicly refused to show proof"" that fewer than 5% of its accounts were fake, and said the deal ""cannot move forward"" until Mr Agrawal does show proof. Mr Musk's tweet then appeared to be deleted. The billionaire, who also runs carmaker Tesla, has put the number of fake accounts at 20% or more. Elon Musk has doubled down on his position that his deal to buy the social network is on ice while the actual amount of spambots and accounts operating on it is investigated. Twitter chief executive Parag Agrawal has hit back, and tempers are flaring. When the richest man in the world replies to one of your tweets with just one symbol, the poo emoji, well, I suppose at least you know you've got his attention. I long ago gave up trying to read the mind of Elon Musk but let's indulge in a moment of speculation. He's making a big deal about fake accounts. Is it a convenient peg on which to hang a renegotiation? His initial $44bn offer for the firm was considerably higher than its current stock suggests. He moved swiftly and aggressively, perhaps even impulsively. To fund it, he's already had to sell a chunk of shares in one of his other companies, the electric car firm Tesla, and that in turn made a dent in the value of that company as it made other investors nervous. If either party in the Twitter deal walks away now, there's a $1bn termination fee. That may sound like small change to a multi-billionaire - although Mr Musk maintains he is asset-rich rather than cash-rich - but it perhaps gives him leverage to successfully shave a few billion off the offer price, because $1bn is not small change to Twitter and its shareholders. However, Mr Musk might be right to question Twitter's worth. If it really isn't bloated with spam, then perhaps it has less potential to be made great again, a phrase that may sound familiar given that he has already indicated that he would like to re-instate former US President Donald Trump. Mr Trump, by the way, has so far declined the invitation. Mr Musk and Mr Agrawal have been publicly debating the spambot figures on Twitter but relations appear to have soured.  On Monday, Mr Musk responded to Mr Agrawal's defence of the the firm's spam reporting with a poo emoji, later repeating his claim that Twitter was underestimating the figure. Mr Musk has said he is concerned that advertisers on Twitter don't know what they are paying for. ""So how do advertisers know what they're getting for their money? This is fundamental to the financial health of Twitter,"" he wrote. After putting his offer on hold Mr Musk told a conference in Miami on Monday that ""you can't pay the same price for something that is much worse than they claimed"". He said that a deal is ""not out of the question"" at a different price but added: ""The more questions I ask, the more my concerns grow."" Twitter has said it is committed to completing the deal at the agreed price.  In a filing with regulators on Tuesday, it told shareholders that Mr Musk's apparent eagerness to get the deal done, even without ordinary research into the business, set him apart from any other potential suitors. ""Other potential [buyers] would require substantial due diligence, creating a delay and risk to reaching the signing of such a potential transaction,"" it said. Mr Musk has called for tests of random samples of Twitter users to identify bots. He said ""there is some chance it might be over 90% of daily active users"". Researchers have estimated that anywhere from 4% to 20% or more of the millions of Twitter profiles are fake. Twitter shares on Monday closed more than 8% down at $37.39, sowing doubts that Mr Musk would go ahead with his acquisition at the agreed price. Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that it ""looks increasingly likely that Elon Musk is positioning to renegotiate a sharply lower price tag for Twitter or even try and pull the pin on the deal"". She said that establishing the number of real users on Twitter is considered ""vital to future revenue streams via advertising or paid for subscriptions on the site"". ""The volatility which has hit tech stocks and contributed to a sharp decline in Twitter's valuation is also highly likely to be part of the equation,"" Ms Streeter said, adding that Mr Musk is ""clearly rueing the timing of his rash offer to pay $44bn for the social network""."
Volatility,Chancellor 'not going to make any comment now' on pound,2024-09-25,2022-09-26,Unknown,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-63036598,No content available
Volatility,Tech Tent: Apple's security under scrutiny,2024-09-25,2017-12-01,By Rory Cellan-Jones,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-42195356,"Will Apple's gold-plated reputation with consumers be dented by an embarrassing security foul-up? Also on the podcast this week: is Bitcoin really using more energy than Ireland? And what kind of qualities do you need to succeed as a professional e-sports player? We try to answer those questions on this week's Tech Tent. For a long time, Apple has boasted - with some justification - that it has an excellent record of keeping its devices safe from intruders.  In any case, with PCs having the lion's share of the computer market, hackers and security researchers used to spend little time hunting down vulnerabilities in Macs. But on Tuesday a Turkish software developer tweeted this: ""Dear @AppleSupport, we noticed a *HUGE* security issue at MacOS High Sierra. Anyone can login as 'root' with empty password after clicking on login button several times."" It sounded unlikely but it was true. What it meant was that anyone who got hold of an Apple computer running the latest operating system could get root access to the machine with very little trouble. ""Root access is a bit like having a master key to the building,"" Prof Angela Sasse, from University College London, tells Tech Tent. ""It's really bad news.""  She explains that it means an intruder could install new software, such as spyware, on your computer. And she is surprised that this issue was not spotted before High Sierra was released. ""Normally before release you would test that root access is adequately protected."" Apple moved quickly to release an update to patch this loophole in the operating system's defences. So will it suffer any long-term consequences in terms of a loss of consumer trust? Neil Mawston, from the tech consultancy Strategy Analytics, says Apple is a very clever company with a great brand.  But he has some concerns: ""We're seeing this gradual tick-tock of mis-steps in delivery.""  Recently, we have seen the delay in the launch of Apple's Homepod - and another, albeit much more minor, security issue.  ""If products are late or they have lots of flaws and that keeps on building up momentum, then that negative press coverage eventually catches up with them."" A decade ago a furious Steve Jobs would have roamed the Cupertino campus to find someone to eject from the building for such a serious error. Tim Cook's style is very much more measured, but do not be surprised if there is some movement in the upper ranks of Mac management in the coming months. It has been a dizzying week for anyone who takes an interest in the crypto-currency Bitcoin. It started 2017 worth just under $1,000 (£740) but this week it soared past the $10,000 mark. In the days that followed, the volatility we have come to expect from the Bitcoin market has become even more pronounced. In the space of three hours, its price dropped by more than $2,000, only to bounce back a few hours later. The debate over whether this is a speculative bubble or the future of money gets hotter by the moment. But so too do concerns over the amount of energy used in the process of mining Bitcoin and recording transactions. As banks of computers whir away, many of them in China, the electricity consumed as they solve increasingly complex mathematical problems gets ever greater. According to one study, Bitcoin is now using more energy each year than the whole of Ireland, and will soon surpass Morocco's energy use. This does not sound sustainable, but as long as the value of Bitcoin keeps rising, miners will not care about the electricity bills. And meanwhile the incentive to plant software on websites to hijack visitors' computers to help mine Bitcoin will only increase. Competitive video gaming or e-sports is a rapidly growing business. Market research firm Newzoo thinks this young industry will make nearly $700m in revenue this year. And it is not all about consoles - mobile gaming is increasingly popular. This weekend, London hosts the Clash Royale Crown World Championships, a global tournament entered by more than 27 million players, according to Supercell, the Finnish creators of the mobile game Clash Royale. Only a few of those will be professional e-sports players. This new breed can earn substantial sums, not only from tournaments but from sponsors, advertisers and from fans who watch them streaming their practice sessions on Twitch or YouTube and just send them money. So what does it take to make it as one of these new sports stars?  We hear from ElecTr1fy - yes, it is important to have an arresting name - who tells us his YouTube channel has added 40,000 subscribers and had generated 40 million views over the last month.  ""You need fast instincts  - every delay can cost you the game,"" he tells us. ""And you need to get into your opponent's head."" That message is reinforced by The Rum Ham, a gamescaster - another new profession - providing live commentary on e-sports. He says it is about making good decisions quickly.  ""They're making decisions where hundreds of thousands of dollars are on the line in a split second.  These players are doing mental maths, spatial awareness, predicting the outcomes of a combat before the troops are even on the field - all in a three-minute game play."" And the prize? Well the best players are making more than a million dollars a year. Time to put away the crossword, forget about the Sudoku and get down to some serious gaming. "

Bridgepoint confirmed the acquisition of one of the UK's largest housebuilders on Wednesday. Established in 1934, Miller Homes focuses on regional markets such as the north of England, Midlands and Scotland. In 2016, the Edinburgh-based company completed a total of 2,380 homes.  Last year it reported a 13% increase in revenue to £565m and a 31% increase in operating profit to £103m.

Volatility,Student numbers drop in Welsh unis,2024-09-25,2018-05-07,By Bethan Lewis,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-44004774,"Five out of Wales' eight universities have seen a drop in student enrolments of up to a quarter over the last three years. Since 2013-14 student numbers at Glyndwr in Wrexham and Aberystwyth universities have fallen by 24%. A senior figure said Welsh universities were in ""a very competitive market"" where removing a cap on student numbers in England had a knock-on effect. Nevertheless, enrolments at Swansea jumped by 29%. Dr David Blaney, chief executive of the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, admitted there was a degree of volatility around the UK universities sector. ""Universities in Wales are part of a market, predominantly with England but actually UK and internationally and it's a very competitive market,"" he said. ""So what we have seen particularly in England is removal of constraints on student numbers which means that some institutions in England - the stronger ones in the market in particular - have grown and that's had a knock-on impact across the whole of the system."" He said students were discerning and looking to make careful choices, taking note of the experiences of those already studying. Dr Blaney said universities had to look beyond the prospectus and advertising. ""If the message coming through social media from existing students is not strong then none of that will have an impact so you really have to look after the interests of the students that you've got,"" he added. Swansea University had 19,160 student enrolments in 2016-17 and they are aiming to get to 20,000 by their centenary in 2020. Pro Vice-Chancellor Prof Iwan Davies said student experience was ""critical"" and with students paying thousands in course fees employability, he said was also a key factor. ""It's great they're here in Swansea, we are in the top 15 in terms of employability in the league tables,"" he said. ""I'm very proud of the relevance of what we offer and the students of course are discerning and they've seen that."" Wrexham Glyndwr University saw student numbers fall from a peak of 9,535 in 2011-12 to 6,415 in 2016-17. A spokesman said there was a ""strategic change of direction"" during the period with a move away from international recruitment. International students made up 28% of enrolments in 2013-14 but by 2016-17 the figure was under 9%. ""During this same period, Welsh student enrolment actually increased from 42% to 62% which highlights success in our strategic change,"" he added. Aberystwyth University said its recruitment patterns had been affected by changes to how much universities could charge. ""The introduction of high tuition fees in 2012 marked a sea-change for the sector and saw a record intake at Aberystwyth University in 2011 - a large cohort which carried through to 2013-14,"" a spokesman said. Dr Blaney said there were still concerns about underfunding and a disparity in what goes into the Welsh system compared to England, with more resources towards supporting students rather than supporting for institutions. Changes to student finance in Wales, which will be introduced from this autumn, mean the tuition fee grant of £5,100 will be scrapped and replaced with a maintenance grant of just over £8,000 for students from the most disadvantaged families. Dr Blaney said the changes following a review by Prof Ian Diamond would rebalance the position ""substantially"" and he believes Wales will catch up with England in terms of investment although it may take several years.  ""At the moment the Welsh sector is arguably slightly less well resourced than the English sector,"" he said. ""So that means that they have to work harder to look attractive which they are doing."" Prof Davies said Swansea had been fortunate in terms of European funding in recent years and he said the Diamond reforms would ""go a long way"" to addressing concerns about the Welsh system being underfunded. But he warned: ""Welsh universities should not be disadvantaged in terms of our competitiveness with our friends in England."""
Volatility,Homes face winter power cuts in worst-case scenario,2024-09-25,2022-10-06,By Noor Nanji,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63155827,"British households could lose power for up to three hours at a time this winter if gas supplies run extremely low, National Grid has warned.  The company said it was an ""unlikely"" scenario but added that supply interruptions were a possibility if the energy crisis escalated.  Cuts would probably occur at peak times and customers would be warned in advance.  But as a ""base case"" National Grid expects homes will face no problems.  Customers would be warned at least a day in advance about the power cuts, which would occur at times of high demand, possibly in the morning, or more likely between 4pm and 7pm. They would be rotated so not all areas of the country were affected at the same time. When campaigning to be leader of the Conservative Party in August, Prime Minister Liz Truss pledged that there would be no energy rationing this winter. Asked on Thursday if she could guarantee there would be no blackouts, the Prime Minister said, ""what we're clear about is that we do have a good supply of energy in the UK, we're in a much better position than many other countries, but of course there's always more we can do and that's why I'm here working with our partners making sure we do have a secure energy supply into the future"". Reports have suggested that some in the government want to run a campaign this winter encouraging households to save energy, but this has been opposed by Ms Truss.   A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, said: ""Ministers are not launching a public information campaign and any claim otherwise is untrue."" The UK is heavily reliant on gas to produce electricity, with gas-fired power stations generating more than 40% of the country's electricity. It also imports electricity from Continental Europe.  National Grid - which keeps the lights on in England, Scotland and Wales - said Russia's invasion of Ukraine had created ""unprecedented turmoil and volatility"" in the energy markets. Gas flows from Russia to Europe have been all but cut off, leaving countries scrambling for alternative supplies. Although Britain is far less reliant on Russian gas than mainland Europe, it could still suffer knock-on effects from any shortfalls in supplies on the continent, National Grid said. In a report, it laid out three possible scenarios for what might happen this winter.  Its central view remains that there will be enough energy to provide Britain with similar levels of electricity to previous winters. But it has modelled two more worrying scenarios which could arise. In the first, the energy crisis in Europe would result in Britain not being able to import electricity from France, Belgium or the Netherlands, although power would still flow from Norway.  Without taking action, National Grid warned this situation could lead to shortages. However, it said it had struck deals with three power companies - EDF, Drax and Uniper - to keep additional coal-fired power generators on standby in case they are needed.  It will also launch a scheme from 1 November which incentivises businesses and households to reduce their electricity use at key times: Some suppliers have raised doubts about the scheme, but National Grid is encouraging them to work with customers to ensure the ""highest levels of participation"". With these measures in place, it thinks that supply interruptions would be avoided. However, it said it had modelled a second, more extreme scenario, in which the energy crisis in Europe escalates, resulting in not enough gas being available in Britain. In that event, distributors would be forced to cut off electricity to homes and firms for up to three hours during the day, it said. The measure, not used since the 1970s, would need the approval of the government and the King. ""In the unlikely event we were in this situation, it would mean that some customers could be without power for pre-defined periods during a day - generally this is assumed to be for three-hour blocks,"" said National Grid. The number of people being cut off from electricity will depend on how many gas-power stations are forced to shut down because of a shortage of gas, it added.  Hospitals and ""priority businesses"" would be protected from the cuts. However, the Energy Networks Association said vulnerable individuals would not necessarily be protected. National Grid said the industry would work with government to inform the public about such measures including via Covid-style press conferences. A separate report by the National Grid, looking specifically at gas supplies over the winter, also warned of a potential for a shortfall in the event of a cold snap, which could be overcome by paying higher prices. Most households saw their energy bills rise on 1 October, as the new energy price guarantee came into effect. However, the rise was less than had previously been expected after the government announced it would cap domestic bills to prevent widespread hardship.  Overall, the grid operator concluded that this is likely to be ""a challenging winter"". The report from the National Grid relates to Great Britain. But there is also a warning that Northern Ireland could face electricity blackouts in 2024 and 2025 unless action is taken. The grid operator, System Operator NI (SONI), says the issue centres on Kilroot power station and environmental permits which limit its operating hours. Earlier this week, industry regulator Ofgem warned the UK is facing a ""significant risk"" of gas shortages this winter, which could impact electricity supplies.  Commenting on National Grid's forecasts, Ofgem said: ""We have one of the most reliable energy systems in the world and we are in a favourable position. ""However, it is incumbent on a responsible and prudent energy sector to ensure the right contingency measures are in place, which is why we are working with the government, National Grid and key partners to protect consumers, so that Great Britain is fully prepared for any challenges this winter."" A government spokesperson said it was ""confident in our plans to protect households and businesses in the full range of scenarios this winter"". Industry group the CBI said although ""there should be sufficient resources to meet demand, the increased risk of energy shortages is worrying for businesses, particularly energy intensive firms"". ""Early forewarning of tight supplies is essential to help firms minimise disruption to supply chains,"" said Tom Thackray, CBI programme director for decarbonisation.  And charity Age UK said ""contingency arrangements need to be planned for now to ensure vulnerable households can be confident of maintaining their electricity supply, come what may"". ""We are thinking, for example, of older people with chronic health conditions who have to remain warm, or others who dependent on electricity to run essential equipment, including home dialysis machines,"" said Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK."
Volatility,Why energy firm Bulb's collapse may cost you £200,2024-09-25,2022-12-01,By Simon Jack,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63805028,"Energy firm Octopus Energy is on track to buy collapsed rival Bulb which is being run by administrators after being bailed out by taxpayers. You may not be one of Bulb's 1.6 million customers, but if you pay tax then you will be funding its rescue. The total estimated bill is more than £200 for every UK taxpayer. So how did a firm that was the poster child for the benefits of new competition in the energy market end up becoming the government's biggest bailout since the 2008 financial crisis? The government's official budget forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), has said the support for the firm will cost the public around £6.5bn (although the government says the net cost will be lower). There are four main reasons: bad regulation, bad luck, bad government policy and most likely some bad maths.  Over the last two decades the energy regulator Ofgem, with the support of Conservative and Labour governments, prioritised stimulating competition in the energy market as the best way to bring down energy bills. The onetime monopoly of British Gas seemed a distant memory when looking at the proliferation of dozens of new providers competing via comparison websites and enabled by easy switching.   However, many of these companies had little or no shock-absorbing financial reserves. That was ok as long as they could pass on any rises in wholesale costs to their customers. When a universally politically popular energy price cap was introduced at the beginning of 2019, the landscape changed. It introduced the risk that energy companies might have to buy energy at a higher cost than they could sell it. Well run companies managed this risk by buying their energy well in advance so they could still survive under a cap set and monitored by Ofgem.   But some didn't do that.  When energy prices started to skyrocket when world demand for oil and gas soared post-Covid, the difference between the wholesale price companies bought energy at and the lower price at which they were allowed to sell it, bankrupted dozens of companies which didn't have the financial reserves to absorb these losses.  This exposed the regulator's failure to pay due - or any - regard to the financial resilience of the companies it regulated.  Ofgem had a system whereby the customers of these small, failed companies were absorbed by the larger, surviving companies. The additional cost incurred by those companies as they had to buy more energy at high prices for new customers, was passed on to all consumer bills over time. But Bulb was deemed too big for other companies to want to absorb and see another big hike to consumer bills at a time when energy costs were soaring. So in November 2021 Bulb was nationalised and special administrators appointed to run it. The government hoped to sell the business by the following spring and set aside £1.7bn to buy the energy to keep supplying Bulb customers until that time.  But worse was to come and energy prices rocketed again when Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, sending any would-be buyers running for the hills. The government found itself owning an energy supplier at the worst time in living memory. Prices rose to five and then 10-times their pre-pandemic, pre-Ukraine rates at the same time as the energy price cap, set every six months, meant they were painfully exposed to the extreme volatility of wholesale energy prices.  The reason more energy companies didn't go bust was that the well-run, financially-resilient ones had insured themselves (""hedged"") against that volatility by buying the gas they needed for their customers well in advance. But the Treasury has a long-standing reluctance to do this. The government prefers to self-insure against financial risk rather than pay a fee to profit making third parties. ""We don't pay Aviva to insure battleships - so we don't pay financial institutions to insure financial risks,"" said one Treasury official. But this is a preference, not a rule. A former senior Treasury official told the BBC that ""Treasury theology wouldn't rule it out"".  So the government could have insured against rocketing prices but chose not to. But even that is not the main driver of the whopping £6.5bn bill for Bulb. It turns out that, to date, the administrators of Bulb have spent less buying energy than the government originally forecast they would. Although the meter is still running on it, they have currently spent less than £1.2bn. It seems the vast majority of the estimated bill comes from Treasury assumptions about a complex set of moving parts. To transfer Bulb back into private ownership, the government has to set aside money to protect the would-be buyer from taking on risks that might ruin the company (Octopus) acquiring it. Estimating the cost of this post-sale support depends on taking a view on future wholesale energy prices, the level at which future retail caps are set, the amount of ongoing government bill support, and assumptions about how much money the acquirer will pay back to the government from any extra profits from its new customers over time.  Industry sources have told the BBC that the government appears to have taken the most conservative/most pessimistic view on all of these factors. Even some in the Treasury seem unsure as to how the number was arrived at, while sources close to the current administrators have used words like ""toppy"" and ""baffling"".  Some energy companies argue it means that Octopus was getting an unreasonable and unfair level of government support to take it out of public ownership.  Lawyers in court argued it amounted to a massive sweetener - or ""cash dowry"" to Octopus.  Octopus hit back, saying other companies were offered the same chance to take on Bulb but walked away.  But crucially, say the objectors to the Bulb/Octopus deal, at the time they were asked to consider taking on Bulb, the government had not yet announced its Energy Price Guarantee which saw the government subsidising household bills, meaning millions of customers who would not have been able to pay, now could. This fundamentally reduced the risk of taking on more customers.  The deal currently in front of the courts for Octopus to take control of Bulb includes a profit sharing agreement which would see Bulb repay some of the government support over time if Octopus made a profit supplying Bulb's customers.  Estimates of the final likely bill range from ""only"" £3bn to £4bn, rather than the OBR's £6.5bn estimate.  ""[The OBR's] cost figure does not include the full details of any deal drawn up as part of the process to remove Bulb from the Special Administration Regime,"" said a business department (BEIS) spokesperson. ""Nor do the OBR figures include the financial support that will be repaid by the new entity in accordance with an agreed repayment schedule, so we still expect the net cost to taxpayers to be much lower."" Sources close to Octopus insist that the government needs to proceed quickly as Bulb's consumer satisfaction scores are plummeting, leaving the government and the taxpayer with an asset deteriorating in value.  The great energy bust of 2021 and 2022 may not yet be over. The Business Secretary Grant Shapps, recently wrote to the remaining suppliers urging them to reduce customer direct debits when they used less energy prompting some, including Centrica boss Chris O'Shea, to imply that some companies were essentially borrowing money from their customers to finance their operations. Some have described the energy bloodbath as the greatest regulatory failure since the financial crisis. While it is probably fair to say that few could have predicted a tenfold spike in the price of gas, regulators are there to imagine the ""what ifs"".  Ofgem has promised a new regime where the financial resilience of market participants, rather than their sheer number, is top of mind. Many will say that is something that a regulator should have been doing anyway. "
Volatility,'China's Netflix' dips in US stock debut,2024-09-25,2018-03-30,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-43592981,"Chinese video streaming service iQiyi - often called China's Netflix - made a rocky US stock market debut as it launched on the Nasdaq.  Shares opened slightly ahead of the $18 listing price, before quickly falling back and closing down 14%. But iQiyi chief executive Gong Yu said he was not concerned about the ""short term volatility"". The firm, controlled by Chinese internet giant Baidu, raised more than $2.2bn (£1.6bn) in the listing. The initial public offering (IPO) gave the streaming service a valuation of about $12.7bn. Despite the initial stock price fall, Mr Gong was confident about the firm's future prospects.  ""Long term, you'll see how much value the IPO creates,"" he told the Reuters news agency.  iQiYi had more than 50 million subscribers by the end of 2017 and an average of more than 420 million mobile users per month, according to Reuters. But while revenues have risen in recent years, iQiyi has never posted a profit since it launched in 2010. You might also like:  In China, it competes with fellow streaming platforms Youku Tudou, which is owned by Alibaba, and Tencent Video.

Last year, iQiyi posted a net loss of 3.7bn yuan (£425m; $592m) compared with 3.1bn yuan in 2016, though revenue jumped by 55% to 17.4bn yuan. Baidu, which founded the business as Qiyi before later changing its name to iQiyi, is itself listed in the US. "
Volatility,"Bitcoin less green since China ban, research says",2024-09-25,2022-02-25,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-60521975,"Bitcoin has become less green since China cracked down on mining the cryptocurrency, new research suggests. Mining refers to the process of creating new bitcoins using banks of powerful computers. The share of renewable energy powering mining fell from 41.6% in 2020 to 25.1% last August as miners stopped using Chinese hydro and moved to the US, where gas supplies much of their power. Researchers estimate Bitcoin now causes carbon emissions comparable to Greece. ""We see the network becoming less green than ever before,"" Alex de Vries, one of the authors of the peer-reviewed study published in the journal Joule, told the BBC. Industry groups had been more optimistic about the use of renewables. Previously, the Bitcoin Mining Council estimated that the ""global mining industry's sustainable electricity mix had grown to approximately 58.5%"". Bitcoin miners will generally attempt to move to places with plentiful cheap electricity in order to maximise their profits. The specialised computers that verify crypto transactions consume large amounts of electricity. In the past, bitcoin miners in China would move in the wet season from provinces with inexpensive electricity generated by fossil fuels, to those with an abundance of hydropower.  But after bans in key provinces, mining was more or less eliminated in China by June 2021.  Forced out of China, mining moved to countries such as the US and Kazakhstan. Researchers say this could be why Bitcoin has become less environmentally-friendly. The move to the US increased the proportion of fossil fuels used, particularly natural gas.  ""The US grid only has a small part of its entire system sourced from renewable energy sources,"" Mr De Vries said. He added that many of the states popular with crypto-miners, such as Texas, Kentucky and Georgia, performed worse than the national average in terms of the amount of power generated from renewables. Kentucky, for example, ""grants tax breaks to attract Bitcoin miners and thus saves coal companies"", the researchers noted. And Kazakhstan, the researchers say, has coal-fired power stations burning ""hard coal"", which are more polluting than their Chinese counterparts. The net result of these shifts, the research estimated, was that the carbon intensity of Bitcoin increased by about 17%. Bitcoin, the research suggests, produces more than 65.4 megatonnes of carbon dioxide per year. By comparison, Greece produced 56.6 megatonnes of carbon dioxide emissions in 2019. ""The carbon footprint per single bitcoin transaction is going to be something like 669 kilograms of carbon dioxide,"" said Mr De Vries. He said it was comparable to the per-passenger carbon footprint of a flight from Amsterdam to New York. An economy-class return flight from London to New York emits an estimated 670kg of CO2 per passenger, according to the calculator from the UN's civil aviation body, the International Civil Aviation Organization. Mr De Vries and his co-authors say their research highlights the need for the crypto industry to accelerate efforts to decarbonise. The Crypto Climate Accord is one such initiative.  Its members pledge to achieve net-zero emissions from electricity consumption related to their crypto operations by 2030. But the report suggests that is a long way off. ""A rapid solution to Bitcoin's carbon footprint is not within sight,"" the authors conclude.  Mr De Vries says it shows the need for international co-operation. ""China decided to ban cryptocurrency mining, but we see that that actually had an adverse effect"", he said."
Volatility,Public inquiry calls over A6 road scheme 'fiasco',2024-09-25,2022-11-23,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-63726495,"There have been calls for a public inquiry into ongoing delays into the completion of a new dual carriageway between Londonderry and Dungiven. The 15-mile stretch is part of the A6 upgrade linking Derry and Belfast. Stormont's Department for Infrastructure (DfI) said key aspects of the project have yet to be completed. However, DUP East Londonderry MP Gregory Campbell said the project had now become ""a fiasco"". Work on the road started in 2018, with an estimated cost of £220m, and had been due to be completed earlier this year. DfI said while the road upgrade is ""well advanced"" essential aspects, including safety barriers and lighting, have yet to be completed. It said at present it is not possible to ""provide an exact opening date"" for the road.  The department has also now confirmed the scheme's budget will exceed the original estimated cost. It included cost details in a Freedom of Information (FOI) request response to BBC Radio Foyle's Mark Patterson Show. DfI said the ""actual cost is under continual review and the final cost will not be known until the project has been completed"". It added: ""Any funding requirements will be factored into future budget settlement"". Speaking earlier to BBC Radio Foyle, Mr Campbell said the A6 should be ""a tremendous asset"". ""But it is an embarrassment to the department now. This fiasco has gone on for far too long,"" he said. The DUP MP said a public inquiry is needed to establish ""how it has come to this"". He said it is needed to establish the nature and cost to the public of the scheme's ""inordinate delay"". Foyle SDLP MLA Mark Durkan said an inquiry would ""demonstrate the shortcomings and what they (DfI) can learn and not repeat"". He said it has become increasingly challenging to get updates on the road scheme from DfI. ""Over the past six to eight months it has become much, much more difficult to get information from the department as to what is happening and when we can expect to see completion of this much needed and long overdue project,"" he said. The Department for Infrastructure began work on the A6 road scheme in 2018. Work was completed on the nine-mile (14.7km) dual carriageway between Toomebridge, County Antrim, and Castledawson, County Derry, last year.  The first phase of the carriageway, between the M22 motorway at Randalstown and Toomebridge, opened in 2019. The dual carriageway is part of a larger scheme to improve the route between Derry and Belfast, with work continuing on a major new road between Derry and Dungiven. Starting at the village of Drumahoe, the 15-mile section of dual carriageway includes a bypass around Dungiven. In September the department said supply-chain issues and global-market volatility were causing the delays. It said at that time it was ""working closely with the contractor"" to agree a completion date. The continued delays are causing frustration for commuters and affected businesses.   At present there are a number of diversions and speed restrictions in place to accommodate the ongoing work. Brian Cassidy owns a cycle shop in the County Londonderry village of Claudy. ""People are stopping with us, asking how to get to Derry, Belfast, Claudy,"" he told BBC Radio Foyle. ""They are turning off not knowing where they are going. We have had lorries stuck up the road, 40ft lorries on back roads that are not designed for them, purely down to signage."" In a statement the DfI said the ""work items yet to be completed"" include ""the provision of safety barrier, road marking, signage and street lighting"". The department added: ""A Road Safety Audit must then be completed before the road can be fully opened. ""The outcome of the audit process may recommend some safety-related amendments and therefore it is not possible to provide an exact opening date at this time."" It said it ""is currently envisaged that the road will open in the coming months""."
Volatility,Pound plunges to its lowest level in over 30 years,2024-09-25,2020-03-18,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51921922,"The pound has fallen to its lowest level against the dollar since 1985, as the spread of the coronavirus pandemic spooks investors. It is currently trading at $1.15, a fall of almost 5% in just one day.  It comes as financial markets tumbled again after major stimulus plans failed to quell fears about the economic impact of the virus. The Dow ended down 6.3%, while the S&P 500 fell 5.1% and the Nasdaq dropped 4.7%. Earlier the Dow and S&P 500 had plunged more than 7%, triggering an automatic temporary halt to trade, but shares recovered some ground as Congress appeared set to approve a relief bill. The pound's weakness could partly stem from questions over how the UK government plans to pay for the emergency economic measures it has introduced, says Neil Wilson, chief analyst for Markets.com. ""This is the worst sustained period of sterling selling that I can recall,"" he says. ""The government's massive fiscal package undoubtedly means more borrowing for the UK economy - how do we pay for all this?"" Meanwhile, the FTSE 100 index of top UK firms closed down 4%, with aerospace and travel firms among the hardest hit.  UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak revealed a £350bn stimulus package for UK firms on Tuesday, including £330bn of business loan guarantees. It included aid to cover a business rates holiday and grants for retailers and pubs, while help for airlines is also being considered. Despite this, investors are still flocking to the comparatively safer dollar, says Ranko Berich, head of Market Analysis at Monex Europe. ""The UK's response to the incoming coronavirus shock has been about as aggressive as possible in terms of monetary and fiscal policy, but this has done nothing to help sterling.  ""Idiosyncratic factors such as the UK's monetary and fiscal response or Brexit are beside the point: this is about the US dollar, which is proving unstoppable as global financial markets stare into the abyss of crisis-like conditions,"" he said. Investors say rescue measures can only blunt the pain, as countries close borders and order mass closures, bringing most economic activity to a halt. The US on Tuesday outlined a $1tn (£830bn) proposal to support the world's biggest economy, which is expected to include direct payments to families, small business assistance and bailouts for airlines and other industries. In the US, large companies have already announced more than 3,600 job cuts or furloughs, according to research firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. The firm said some nine million other jobs at local bars and restaurants could also be at risk. Car factories in the UK and elsewhere have halted production, while the slowdown has pushed other firms such as Laura Ashley and Flybe into administration. Concerns about the damage have spurred a widespread sell-off. France's CAC 40 fell more than 6% while Germany's Dax dropped more than 5%.  Oil prices also plunged to levels not seen since the early 2000s, as demand contracts sharply, but exporters boost supply. The declines have even hit gold and government debt, which are typically considered less risky assets. Asian markets have fared better than the US and Europe in recent days, but were also lower. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 ended Wednesday 1.7% lower, the Hang Seng in Hong Kong fell by 3.3%, and China's Shanghai Composite lost 1.8%.  Sterling's fall to a 35-year low against the dollar is clearly troubling.  It is down 12% since the beginning of last week, and 5% today alone. This is partly down to the strengthening dollar, due to its status as a ""safe haven,"" the inevitable result of global volatility in financial markets amid the Coronavirus pandemic.  But those aren't the only reasons for sterling's weakness. The pound has sunk to to just over €1.06 against the euro- its lowest level since the depth of the financial crisis 11 years ago.  The pound is likely to be at a record low on measures of its global value, to be calculated tomorrow. At the same time, UK government borrowing costs are creeping up, with the presumption these would stay ""lower for longer"" now being tested in global debt markets.  Traders have raised a range of reasons for why the UK is being particularly singled out for attention.  There is growing expectation of ever bigger fiscal injections to combat the economic impact of the pandemic and the UK is still very dependent on foreign flows of capital. Its strategy for dealing with the pandemic was seen, say traders, as an outlier amongst the world's major economies.  Then there is Brexit. The UK has the extra economic challenge of dealing with a fundamental change to trading arrangements with the EU, perhaps on WTO tariffs, in the middle of this pandemic.  It is a very rough market out there, with some markets a little dysfunctional as traders are isolated away from their trading floors. But the UK is being singled out for especially tough treatment."
Volatility,UK inflation shock: This is really grim,2024-09-25,2023-06-21,By Faisal Islam,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-65974092,"This is a grim number. Inflation isn't just stubborn, or sticky. It is, on the latest numbers, stuck. These figures should be falling by now, and they are in other countries such as the US and Germany.   My inbox was deluged with instant takes at 7am ranging from ""unfortunate"" to ""challenging"" to ""disaster"". Over the past 18 months the Governor of the Bank of England has told the BBC workers should not ask for excessive pay rises and companies should not hike prices too much either.  Core inflation, a measure of underlying and ongoing inflationary pressure that strips out month to month volatility, is, however, going up, even as it is in decline elsewhere in other major economies. The polite requests have not worked. The response of Karen Ward, a respected City economist who serves on the chancellor's council of advisers that the Bank of England ""has to create a recession"" partly to ""nip in the bud"" a spiral of wages going up and in turn pushing up prices, and then pushing up wages again. ""It's only when companies feel nervous about the future that they will think 'Well, maybe I won't put through that price rise', or workers, when they're a little bit less confident about their job, think 'Oh, I won't push my boss for that higher pay,'"" she told the BBC's Today programme. She said out loud what the Treasury cannot say out loud but has implied in repeated interviews - people have to feel the pain for interest rate rises to work. The Chancellor again said he would support the Bank of England in its decisions - making clear his support for further rate rises. But any hope of a controlled economic descent with plenty of distance ahead of an election late next year, now looks fraught. But it is not just about the specific decision on Thursday, but about the path of interest rates for the next two years. The markets are pretty openly questioning whether the Bank is in full command over where inflation is going. Financial markets and banks are effectively pushing up fixed term mortgage rates, without waiting for actual Bank of England decisions. But the unflattering international comparison also shows a limit to how much the government can blame everything on ""global factors"". Continental Europe was particularly hit by surging energy prices in the aftermath of the Ukraine war, the rest of the world by food prices, and the US by a worker shortages. The UK still suffers from a cocktail of all three. And the government's own post Brexit policies on trade and workers may have lessened competitive pressures that would in the past have brought inflation down more rapidly. Wednesday's number shows that the already tricky balancing act between inflation and recession is getting worse. It may require more than just the Bank of England to do the heavy lifting."
Volatility,Blackburn edge Cardiff to boost promotion hopes,2024-09-25,2023-01-01,Dafydd Pritchard,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/64088347,"Blackburn's Sam Gallagher (left) confronted Perry Ng of Cardiff as tempers flared in the first half Blackburn Rovers earned just a second win from six games to revive their promotion hopes as Bradley Dack's deflected goal saw off Cardiff City. A sticky Ewood Park pitch made for tough viewing in a goalless first half. Three minutes after the break, Dack's shot diverted off Jack Simpson to wrong-foot Cardiff keeper Ryan Allsop. The visitors had chances of their own but the Championship's lowest scorers were ultimately blunt in attack once again and remain 20th in the table. The Bluebirds have now gone seven games without a win and could see their three-point lead over the bottom three reduced or cut completely when the teams below them play later on Sunday. As for Blackburn, victory closes the gap between them and the two automatic promotion spots to eight points, though second-placed Sheffield United could restore their advantage when they visit Queens Park Rangers on Monday night. This was a welcome result for Jon Dahl Tomasson's men, who had held on to third spot despite losing four of their previous five matches in the Championship.  As if embodying the innate volatility of this league, Rovers are still the only team in England's top five divisions not to have drawn this season. While their 14 wins are bettered only by leaders Burnley and Sheffield United, only Huddersfield and Wigan in the bottom three have lost more games than Blackburn's 12. That could hardly have been in starker contrast to Cardiff, who had drawn four matches in succession as part of a winless run stretching back to 5 November. A lack of goals has been their most glaring weakness, with a meagre total of 20 from 26 games making them the Championship's lowest scorers.  Cardiff looked like a team short on attacking quality and confidence here, frequently failing to turn promising positions into genuine scoring opportunities. After inviting passes from Ryan Wintle and Callum O'Dowda went unrewarded, a swift counter-attack which ought to have led to a goal ultimately came to nothing as Gavin Whyte was thwarted by an excellent covering tackle from Blackburn's Jake Garrett.  Whyte was not helped by the run of the ball on a troublesome pitch at Ewood Park; muddy, cutting up in places and a hindrance to both sides' attempts to play with any sort of fluency. Blackburn could only muster a handful of long-range efforts in a first half of few openings, with the best of a limited bunch falling to Cardiff's Callum Robinson, whose low shot was saved by Thomas Kaminski. Rovers' first shot on target inside the Cardiff penalty area came three minutes into the second half and, with a considerable dose of fortune, it yielded the game's only goal.  Dack struck powerfully from Ben Brereton Diaz's pass and the ball hit Simpson before dribbling into the net. It was a messy goal befitting a disjointed encounter. Buoyed by taking the lead, the home side had a couple of other sights on goal as Brereton Diaz drew saves from Allsop twice in quick succession.  But with Cardiff offering so little in attack, Blackburn did not need to overexert themselves in the closing stages as they held on for a valuable three points. Blackburn manager Jon Dahl Tomasson: ""I'm really pleased to get the win. It was a difficult game against Cardiff. They came with a gameplan, sitting back with a 5-4-1 which was difficult to play against. ""I think we started with great energy, then at half-time we spoke about some solutions to get more dangerous and we did that immediately in the second half and got the goal. ""We probably should have got some more goals as well but in the end we dug in on a difficult pitch. Well done to the job boys. It's a great way to start the new year."" Cardiff manager Mark Hudson: ""I'm extremely frustrated. I thought by changing shape we'd get more attacking threat in the game but that didn't seem to be the case. ""They scored, we tried to change it up but didn't really pose any threat on their goal. We started the second half the way we did and then we're chasing the game. ""We've just got to keep working. We've got to keep believing in front of goal, believe that we can create and have faith in our ability."" Can they identify The Traitors to win £120,000?

Volatility,Trade row 'could affect thousands of whisky jobs',2024-09-25,2020-01-30,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-51309632,"Spirits giant Diageo has warned that thousands of Scotch whisky jobs could be affected by the ongoing US-EU trade dispute. Diageo's global supply chain boss Ewan Andrew said tariffs had left smaller distilleries vulnerable, as well as supply chain operators such as farms. The US imposed a 25% tariff on imports of single malt Scotch in October. It was among measures introduced by the US in retaliation against EU subsidies given to aircraft maker Airbus. According to industry figures, more than 10,000 people are directly employed in the Scotch whisky sector in Scotland. A further 40,000 jobs across the UK are supported by the industry - 7,000 of which are in rural areas of Scotland. Mr Andrew told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: ""The important thing as we look forward is that we de-escalate on both sides and that products such as consumer goods are not tied in to something that is about the aerospace industry. ""My concern would be for the broader industry and for those smaller players in the industry. ""Right now I am sure it has had an impact on some of their businesses but if it were to escalate, that really would be difficult for Scotland.  ""So what's good for Scotch is good for Scotland, and that's why we would encourage a de-escalation so that it doesn't impact thousands of jobs right out into farming and rural communities."" Mr Andrew's comments come after representatives of the UK and US whisky industries called for the end of ""punitive tariffs that are wiping millions off export values every month"". The chief executives of the Scotch Whisky Association and the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States urged the UK and US governments to ""urgently find a negotiated solution to unrelated trade disputes and to remove all tariffs on distilled spirits"". In a separate development, Diageo has reported a rise in half-year profits, boosted by a strong performance in China. However, it expects sales to grow more slowly because of ""uncertainty in the global trade environment"". The company - whose brands include Smirnoff, Guinness, Johnnie Walker, Tanqueray and Gordon's gin - reported that in the six months to 31 December, operating profit increased 0.5% to £2.44bn. In Greater China, which includes Taiwan, net sales increased 24%, with double-digit growth in both Chinese white spirits and Scotch. Chief executive Ivan Menezes described the interim figures as ""another good, consistent set of results"", but warned that they had been delivered ""in the face of increased levels of volatility in India, Latin America and Caribbean and travel retail""."
Volatility,Oil drilling plan to be examined at appeal,2024-09-25,2022-10-11,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-lincolnshire-63172647,"An appeal over plans to drill for oil in the Lincolnshire Wolds will be considered on Tuesday. Egdon Resources applied for permission at a site in the village of Biscathorpe but the plans were rejected by Lincolnshire County Council. Campaigners raised climate concerns and said the benefits did not outweigh the harmful impact on the area. The firm appealed against the council's decision and a planning inspector will examine the application at the hearing. Egdon Resources said its plans could draw 30 million barrels of oil from the site and provide supplies for 15 years, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. But councillors and campaigners said the proposals would spoil the Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). The application was rejected in November 2021 because of its impact on the area, the effect of lighting and noise and because it was considered to be in conflict with the council's minerals and waste local plan. Egdon appealed against the decision.  The company's managing director Mark Abbot told a Lincolnshire County Council meeting there is ""a national need for onshore oil"". He said that Russia's invasion of Ukraine had led to significant rises in oil prices and volatility in pricing. A government planning inspector will look at the application and the council's decision during a one-day hearing at Kenwick Park Hotel, near Louth, from 10:00 BST.

Volatility,Did robots trigger the market plunge?,2024-09-25,2018-02-06,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42959755,"Robot trading has accelerated this week's market dive and may have sparked the sell-off, experts say. Financial firms use computers programmed with complex sets of instructions known as algorithms. They identify trading opportunities and then strike faster than any human could. Algorithmic trading has become so ubiquitous that some estimate well over half of all trading of the S&P 500 Index is done this way.  Such automated trading almost certainly accelerated the sell-off on Monday, which saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average crashing 800 points in ten minutes. ""The explosive speed of the fall ... that is done by machines,"" said Tom Stevenson, Investment Director at Fidelity Personal Investing. Most analysts believe the market tumble was prompted by a report on the US job market, released on Friday, which showed strong wage growth. But the decision to sell on that news may have been made by robot traders. US government bonds, or Treasuries, fell in value after the US jobs report. Yields (the interest that bonds offer investors) rise as prices fall. It's thought that robot traders were waiting for that yield to hit 3% - a significant figure as it could prompt human investors to switch out of shares into bonds. Mr Stevenson said: ""Everyone looks for a reason for why the fall happened. One of them was that bond yields rose up towards the magic number of 3%. ""There seems to have been a trigger at 2.9% for automatic trading to sell and once that trigger was pulled the markets went into freefall."" Piers Curran, head of trading at Amplify Trading, explained that algorithms will be set up to react in certain ways to certain situations. He said: ""One might work by a stop loss criteria, selling an asset as it falls to prevent further losses.  ""So if the Dow Jones Index has dropped 5% it may trigger the machine to sell, but if you have a huge number of these algorithms hitting stop losses at the same time that produces further falls which produce further stop losses."" The algorithmic trading can also be triggered by ""correlation"" trades, when movement in one market will trigger a trade in a different market. Last week an Index called the VIX, nicknamed the Fear Index because it measures stock market volatility, started to rise sharply.  Mr Currant said: ""The VIX was very elevated last week, and doubled on Monday, and because there is often an inverse correlation between the VIX and the Dow Jones Index, the machine trades sold US equities.""  The triggers though can work in the opposite direction.  Many of the algorithms that sold equities on Monday were ""selling short"", that is selling stocks specifically to buy them back cheaper later and net a profit. Steep market falls created by algorithms can create equally steep recoveries. Mr Curran said: ""The markets were reacting to some very specific numbers on Monday, but they are only one set of figures. ""We are going to have to see wages growing strongly in February too and get at least four rises in interest rates this year before we can be sure inflation is going to be that much higher.  ""The market reaction to these single numbers was massively exaggerated because of the machine trades."" Mr Stevenson agreed: ""Algorithmic trading or quant trading does make markets more volatile."" Longer term Mr Stevenson is not pessimistic. ""There are two things that can cause a proper bear market - interest rates rising faster than expected, or a recession,"" he said. ""Rates may rise a little faster but not excessively so. As for a recession, all the evidence, bearing in mind the strength of the US economy, is against it."""

Fourth quarter revenue slipped 2% to $17.1bn (£13.3bn), falling short of analyst estimates of $17.5bn. The bank said income on its bond trading desks had slumped by a fifth following the fluctuations on financial markets in December. But chief executive Michael Corbat said the lender, which is America's third largest, was making ""solid progress"". ""A volatile fourth quarter impacted some of our market sensitive businesses, particularly fixed income,"" he said.  In the three months to the end of December, profit rose to $4.2bn, or $1.61 a share, from $3.7bn, or $1.28 a share, a year earlier.

Volatility,Power NI to raise electricity price by 27.5%,2024-09-25,2022-05-20,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-61519887,"Northern Ireland's largest electricity supplier, Power NI, has announced it will increase prices for domestic customers by 27.5% from 1 July 2022. It means the average household bill will go up by £204 a year. The Utility Regulator has approved the tariff. Power NI said the change was due to price increases in the wholesale energy market. It follows a 21.4% price rise at the beginning of January and a 6.9% rise last July. The increase will affect more than 450,000 households and comes as consumers across Northern Ireland face higher food and fuel costs. William Steele, customer solutions director for Power NI, said the firm had tried to keep prices as low as possible and ""absorbed costs for as along as we can"". ""Regrettably, geopolitical factors outside our control, have resulted in prolonged high costs in the international wholesale energy markets,"" he said. ""Like other suppliers we have no choice but to pay these increased costs, which feed into the price of wholesale electricity and have a knock-on effect on tariffs."" The company said it was committed to helping customers hit by rising prices and added that a number of discounted payment schemes can help cut customer costs, including online billing. The Utility Regulator, which approved the tariff increase after receiving a submission from Power NI in April, said prices will come down when wholesale prices reduce. ""We continue to see a lot of volatility in the wholesale energy markets, which makes predicting when prices will start to drop, extremely difficult,"" Chief Executive of the Utility Regulator John French said. ""However, if wholesale prices do begin to reduce, our system of regulation in Northern Ireland allows us to act to make sure that reductions are fully passed onto consumers as quickly as possible."" The regulator said Power NI's increase will be 17% cheaper than the average annual tariffs in Great Britain and Ireland, which are both £1,142 compared to Power NI's £944."
Volatility,Scotland's economy shrinks on 'Brexit uncertainty',2024-09-25,2019-09-18,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-49741765,"Scotland's economy shrank between April and June, according to the latest official figures.  Data released by the Scottish government shows output contracted by 0.3% over the period.  Construction saw a sharp reduction in activity - and Scotland's service sector barely grew.  GDP in Scotland was up by 0.7% over the year, while the UK economy grew by 1.2% over the same period. In June it emerged total output from the Scottish economy grew at its fastest pace for two years in the first three months of 2019. The latest report said: ""The biggest falls have occurred in sectors which showed large increases in the previous quarter. ""The previous growth was likely to be due to stockpiles being built or work being brought forward ahead of the original planned exit date from the European Union."" Finance Secretary Derek Mackay said: ""Given the repeated warnings from business organisations and the contraction across the UK in the same quarter, it is unsurprising but deeply frustrating that we are now seeing the Brexit impact on the Scottish economy. ""The responsibility for this contraction lies entirely with the UK government."" The UK is preparing to leave the EU at the end of next month and Prime Minister Boris Johnson has pledged to complete Brexit by then ""do or die"". Mr Mackay said: ""There can now be no doubt that any form of Brexit will damage our economy and a no-deal Brexit would be disastrous for Scotland and could push the country into recession."" He added: ""Scotland did not vote for Brexit but our economy is paying the price for it and we are likely to see continued volatility as businesses try to prepare for the looming October Brexit deadline and the increasing threat of a no-deal exit. ""We are already taking steps to protect jobs and our economy from Brexit but not every impact can be mitigated."" In the first three months of 2019 more than half of GDP growth came from two sectors - the manufacturing of spirits and wines, and pharmaceuticals. This was linked to stockpiling ahead of an earlier EU exit deadline, with the statistics for April to June showing a ""downturn in growth in these same industries, which may be the result of companies running down the stockpiled inventories"". The figures don't include output from offshore oil and gas extraction Scottish Secretary Alister Jack said: ""I am concerned the Scottish economy has shrunk over the last quarter and continues to lag behind UK-wide figures.  ""Coming on the back of disappointing unemployment figures, more needs to be done to boost our economy and close the gap."" Mr Jack pledged to continue working with the Scottish government to boost the economy and create jobs.  He added: ""To date, the UK government has committed £1.4bn in city and growth deals and we will seize all of the opportunities that will arise once we leave the EU.   ""I urge the Scottish government to use the considerable powers at their disposal to improve the Scottish economy rather than holding it back with threats of a second independence referendum and the decision to make Scotland the most highly taxed part of the UK.""   Andrew McRae, Federation of Small Businesses' (FSB) Scotland policy chair, said: ""These figures are disheartening if unsurprising.  ""Across the country, firms are either pouring resources into Brexit planning or postponing critical decisions until our political leaders get their act together. That means that they're not using every tool at their disposal to create jobs and drive growth."" He said the priority of small businesses is to avoid a no-deal, no-transition Brexit in just a few weeks.  The period covered three months after the original EU departure date at the end of March, following a period of stockpiling by manufacturing firms.  Labour MP and Best for Britain supporter Ian Murray said: ""Constitutional upheaval is causing economic turmoil in Scotland and across the UK.  ""If we crash out of the EU without a deal then the economic damage will be considerably more severe.""  Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie also expressed concern. He said: ""The impact of Brexit is hitting investment, jobs and living standards, and the main phase hasn't even happened yet."""
Volatility,No extra cash for budget deals,2024-09-25,2020-02-12,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-51483471,"The sofa of Scottish government budgeting has been thoroughly rifled.  All possible hiding places for stashes of cash, for use in a potential budget deal with opposition MSPs, have been cleaned out.  There's nothing stuffed down the back, insists stand-in finance secretary Kate Forbes. ""Every available penny is on the face of the budget.""  No, this is not like previous years, she tells a sceptical Tory, Murdo Fraser.  So if opposition parties have more for councils at the top of their list of demands, the stand-in finance secretary says they're going to have to say where it comes from. This was the public message to Holyrood's finance and constitution committee, ahead of private meetings with representatives of Conservatives, Greens, Liberal Democrats and the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities.  Labour's team is scheduled to meet her next week.  Ms Forbes needs at least one of these parties to support the budget, or to abstain. Otherwise, there are several big problems come April and the start of the financial year. Wednesday was the day when Kate Forbes' draft budget began its rapid journey through the legislative machine. This is a recess week, but MSPs and the minister turned up to move things along.   They get to the first big vote in the final week of this month, and the stage three clincher is on March 5. The law has to be signed off before councils can set their budgets and council tax levels. That final vote, as you'll probably recall, is six days before Sajid Javid stands up at the Commons despatch box, with a budget which will tell the Scottish Parliament how big its block grant will be.  Ahead of then, there's more uncertainty than usual about the numbers. If there is more money from the Chancellor, then it can't be added to the Scottish budget bill.  It may have to be added mid-year. It was with local authorities that MSPs began their scrutiny of the budget.  More than half a billion pounds of extra funding is being handed to councils, but it's all earmarked; for Scottish government childcare policy, for the national deal on teachers' pay, and for pensions. For everything else, there's less money available. Murdo Fraser pointed to more than 3% extra funding for day-to-day spending on public services, but a real terms cut for councils, asking: is that fair? Labour's Neil Bibby said the council allocation is ""obscene"". The Greens' Patrick Harvie had the direst of warnings: ""I'm sure I'm not the only person around this table who has been told by local government colleagues that the kind of choices they and their colleagues are going to be faced with in the coming weeks will result in substantial reductions in core services - teacher numbers, additional support for learning, social care.  ""They have serious concerns that councils will be in breach of their legal duties as a result of choices that they will be forced to make."" The minister responded that councils, unlike others dependent on Holyrood funding, have the flexibility to raise funds from council tax, up to 3% in real terms. She pointed to other sources of funding that help councils do what they do; city deals, for instance, and housing funds. Under sustained questions, the minister turned to a familiar narrative. She is ""still dealing with a decade of austerity"". It's not over - not, at least, if so much of the uplift in budget is committed to health and social care. Climate change spending is going up, conceded Patrick Harvie, but that's after two years of going down. And could the minister point to spending choices that reduced the carbon footprint, rather than pouring concrete and asphalt into making life easier for motorists? The cars on those improved roads should be increasingly electric by the end of this decade, responded Ms Forbes. Is there anything to lower the cost of bus travel, asked Mr Harvie?  Had the minister, for instance, considered making bus fares free for people aged under 25? One could see the direction of low-carbon travel to this line of questioning.  Greens and Labour are arguing for that policy, and may wish to get political concessions, as well as the ticketed variety, as the price of a budget deal.  With the kitty empty, there's nothing like enough money or time to implement it in 2020-21, but with a pledge to look into it, that could be a handy giveaway a year from now, ahead of the May 2021 Holyrood election. Before Kate Forbes made her appearance, the Scottish Fiscal Commission was taking MSPs' questions. The official adviser on the assumptions ministers make on tax, it published its report last Thursday alongside the budget.   That made clear that there's growing risk in the Scottish budget, as it takes on a bigger range of devolved powers. The risk of under-shooting the forecast revenue for income tax is one such risk.  Having done so in 2017-18, the first year with the new income tax powers, revenue came in £204m short. That is withheld from the Treasury block grant for 2020-21, and Kate Forbes plans to borrow that amount to plug the gap. But next year, the shortfall on forecast income tax revenue comes in at £555m. Borrowing to plug that gap is maxing out Holyrood's credit limit. As the Fiscal Commissioners pointed out, this has effectively been a loan from three years ago. So, they asked, is it really wise to finance the loan when it falls due by taking out another loan? The new risk this year is that the social security benefits may add up faster than forecast.  In addition to around £300m of welfare budget in the year now ending, £3bn of spending through the Department of Work and Pensions is also being devolved. A small portion of it will go into a new benefit, for children in low income families. But most of it is to fund disability living and attendance allowances.  Government has to pay that money out if people meet the criteria for receiving it. That number can change, and from April onwards, Holyrood takes on the risk that it goes over budget. Until now, Westminster has met such unexpectedly high welfare bills with its flexibility in borrowing. But Holyrood has more constrained borrowing powers. So before he quit in disgrace, former finance secretary Derek Mackay wrote to the Treasury in London, asking for additional borrowing powers to smooth this volatility. The Treasury answer, Kate Forbes told MSPs: let us know when it becomes a problem.  And remember: eventually, we could see an overshoot of forecasts for income tax revenue or benefits, leaving more money for distribution elsewhere. Meantime, the Scottish Fiscal Commission says the Scottish government should not simply rely on borrowing to bail it out of trouble.  As Holyrood faces more financial risk, Ms Forbes is being warned not to rush into splurging every penny of extra cash that comes from Mr Javid.  Even if it's a year out from an election, caution is advised."
Volatility,Farm subsidies 'must be earned' - Gove,2024-09-25,2017-07-21,By Roger Harrabin,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-40673559,"Farm subsidies will have to be earned rather than just handed out in future, the Environment Secretary Michael Gove has said in a speech. Farmers will only get payouts if they agree to protect the environment and enhance rural life, he will say. The move is part of what he calls his vision for a ""green Brexit"". Farmers’ leaders want the current £3bn total to be spent on the environment, more infrastructure to develop farm businesses, and promoting British food. The government has promised to keep overall payments at the same level until 2022. The Tenant Farmers' Association - which represents tenant farmers in England and Wales - has called for the same amount of money to remain after that time. Under the EU's current Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), farmers are paid based on the amount of land they farm. However, in a speech at WWF's Living Planet Centre in Woking on Friday, Mr Gove said the current system will be abolished after the UK has left the EU. He criticised the current system for giving money to some of the UK's wealthiest landowners, for encouraging wastage, and for not recognising ""good environmental practice"". Mr Gove described Brexit as ""a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to reform how we care for our land, our rivers and our seas, how we recast our ambition for our country’s environment, and the planet"".  Critics say under the CAP wealthy UK landowners are given subsidies of up to £3m a year. The issue was highlighted last year when BBC News revealed that taxpayers are paying more than £400,000 a year to subsidise a farm where a billionaire Saudi prince breeds racehorses. The Newmarket farm of Khalid Abdullah al Saud - owner of the legendary horse Frankel - is among the top recipients of farm grants, along with the Queen. Environmentalists will applaud the promise of change; they blame the CAP for the huge loss of wildlife in the British countryside. The question for Mr Gove will be what detailed policy takes its place.  Mr Gove said in his speech: “There are very good reasons why we should provide support for agriculture. Seventy per cent of our land is farmed - beautiful landscape has not happened by accident but has been actively managed.  “Agriculture is an industry more susceptible to outside shocks and unpredictable events - whether it’s the weather or disease. So financial assistance and mechanisms which can smooth out the vicissitudes farmers face make sense."" He also expressed a desire to protect the “human ecology” of Britain’s highlands, where farming without subsidy is impossible. This won’t please radical environmentalists, who want Mr Gove to save money (and in their view enhance the environment) by letting sheep farming wither, and allowing the uplands to revert to natural forest. The Country Land and Business Association, known as the CLA, accepts the need for reform and has launched a plan for a land management contract.  Ross Murray, president of the CLA - which represents owners of land, property and businesses in England and Wales - said there is ""vital work to be done"", including to support farming practices, to manage soils and preserve land. When pressed on whether rich landowners should received public money, he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he was open to change but practices such as tree planting - which are good for the environment but provide landowners with little benefit - should still be recognised. Asked if farming subsidies could be reduced in the future, he added: ""In the long term perhaps, but in the meantime I think we're going to have to support farmers who provide public goods which could never be provided by the market."" Craig Bennett, head of Friends of the Earth, welcomed the speech, but said: “Current EU rules aimed at tackling air pollution and climate change and protecting our birds, bees and nature must not be watered down, and mechanisms must be put in place to enforce them post-Brexit."" National Farmers' Union (NFU) president Meurig Raymond said that, after leaving the EU, ""it is important that we see a broad and innovative range of measures to ensure farmers continue to deliver all the benefits - for our wellbeing, for our economy and for our environment - that the country enjoys"".  He added: ""Such a policy needs to be comprehensive, providing support to farmers not just for environmental work, but also to manage risk and volatility, and to improve productivity and resilience among farming businesses.""  One crucial question will be who has the final say on proposed developments in the UK's prime wildlife sites. At the moment they are protected by the EU as part of Europe's common heritage. That protection may disappear after Brexit.  Follow Roger on Twitter."
Volatility,Did robots trigger the market plunge?,2024-09-25,2018-02-06,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42959755,"Robot trading has accelerated this week's market dive and may have sparked the sell-off, experts say. Financial firms use computers programmed with complex sets of instructions known as algorithms. They identify trading opportunities and then strike faster than any human could. Algorithmic trading has become so ubiquitous that some estimate well over half of all trading of the S&P 500 Index is done this way.  Such automated trading almost certainly accelerated the sell-off on Monday, which saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average crashing 800 points in ten minutes. ""The explosive speed of the fall ... that is done by machines,"" said Tom Stevenson, Investment Director at Fidelity Personal Investing. Most analysts believe the market tumble was prompted by a report on the US job market, released on Friday, which showed strong wage growth. But the decision to sell on that news may have been made by robot traders. US government bonds, or Treasuries, fell in value after the US jobs report. Yields (the interest that bonds offer investors) rise as prices fall. It's thought that robot traders were waiting for that yield to hit 3% - a significant figure as it could prompt human investors to switch out of shares into bonds. Mr Stevenson said: ""Everyone looks for a reason for why the fall happened. One of them was that bond yields rose up towards the magic number of 3%. ""There seems to have been a trigger at 2.9% for automatic trading to sell and once that trigger was pulled the markets went into freefall."" Piers Curran, head of trading at Amplify Trading, explained that algorithms will be set up to react in certain ways to certain situations. He said: ""One might work by a stop loss criteria, selling an asset as it falls to prevent further losses.  ""So if the Dow Jones Index has dropped 5% it may trigger the machine to sell, but if you have a huge number of these algorithms hitting stop losses at the same time that produces further falls which produce further stop losses."" The algorithmic trading can also be triggered by ""correlation"" trades, when movement in one market will trigger a trade in a different market. Last week an Index called the VIX, nicknamed the Fear Index because it measures stock market volatility, started to rise sharply.  Mr Currant said: ""The VIX was very elevated last week, and doubled on Monday, and because there is often an inverse correlation between the VIX and the Dow Jones Index, the machine trades sold US equities.""  The triggers though can work in the opposite direction.  Many of the algorithms that sold equities on Monday were ""selling short"", that is selling stocks specifically to buy them back cheaper later and net a profit. Steep market falls created by algorithms can create equally steep recoveries. Mr Curran said: ""The markets were reacting to some very specific numbers on Monday, but they are only one set of figures. ""We are going to have to see wages growing strongly in February too and get at least four rises in interest rates this year before we can be sure inflation is going to be that much higher.  ""The market reaction to these single numbers was massively exaggerated because of the machine trades."" Mr Stevenson agreed: ""Algorithmic trading or quant trading does make markets more volatile."" Longer term Mr Stevenson is not pessimistic. ""There are two things that can cause a proper bear market - interest rates rising faster than expected, or a recession,"" he said. ""Rates may rise a little faster but not excessively so. As for a recession, all the evidence, bearing in mind the strength of the US economy, is against it."""
Volatility,Market turmoil hits Citigroup revenues,2024-09-25,2019-01-14,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46866751,"US bank Citigroup has blamed the recent turmoil on global markets for a surprise drop in revenue. Fourth quarter revenue slipped 2% to $17.1bn (£13.3bn), falling short of analyst estimates of $17.5bn. The bank said income on its bond trading desks had slumped by a fifth following the fluctuations on financial markets in December. But chief executive Michael Corbat said the lender, which is America's third largest, was making ""solid progress"". ""A volatile fourth quarter impacted some of our market sensitive businesses, particularly fixed income,"" he said.  In the three months to the end of December, profit rose to $4.2bn, or $1.61 a share, from $3.7bn, or $1.28 a share, a year earlier. Citi is the first of the major US banks to post results in 2019, with JP Morgan, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs all due to issue fourth-quarter figures later this week. "
Volatility,Trump says Supreme Court nominee will be a woman,2024-09-25,2020-09-19,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-54216710,"US President Donald Trump has said he will next week nominate a woman to replace the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, escalating a political row over her successor. Ginsburg, 87, died on Friday, just weeks before the presidential election. Mr Trump's Democratic rival, Joe Biden, insists the decision on her replacement should wait until after the vote. The ideological balance of the nine-member court is crucial to its rulings on the most important issues in US law. But President Trump has vowed to swear in Ginsburg's successor ""without delay"", a move that has infuriated Democrats, who fear Republicans will vote to lock in a decades-long conservative majority on the country's highest court. ""I will be putting forth a nominee next week. It will be a woman,"" Mr Trump said at a campaign rally in Fayetteville, North Carolina on Saturday. ""I think it should be a woman because I actually like women much more than men."" Some supporters chanted ""Fill that seat!"" as Mr Trump spoke, urging him to take the rare opportunity to nominate a third justice during one presidential term to a lifetime appointment on the court. Earlier, Mr Trump praised two female judges who serve on federal courts of appeals as possible choices. Both judges - Amy Coney Barrett and Barbara Lagoa - are conservatives who would tip the balance of the Supreme Court in favour of Republicans. Democrats have vigorously opposed any nomination before November's election, arguing that Senate Republicans blocked Democratic President Barack Obama's choice for the US top court in 2016.  At the time, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell justified the move on grounds that it was an election year. But on Friday Senator McConnell said he intended to act on any nomination Mr Trump made and bring it to a vote in the Senate before election day. Ginsburg, a liberal icon and feminist standard-bearer, died of metastatic pancreatic cancer at her home in Washington DC, surrounded by her family. She was only the second-ever woman to sit on the Supreme Court. Supporters gathered outside the court on Friday night to pay tribute to the woman who had become affectionately known as ""The Notorious RBG"". The appointment of judges in the US is a political question which means the president gets to choose who is put forward. The Senate then votes to confirm - or reject - the choice. Ginsburg, who served for 27 years, was one of only four liberals on the nine-seat bench. Her death means that, should the Republicans get the vote through, the balance of power would shift decisively towards the conservatives. Mr Trump, who has already chosen two Supreme Court justices during his presidency, is well aware that getting his nominee in would give conservatives control over key decisions for decades to come. Justices can serve for life, unless they decide to retire. ""We were put in this position of power and importance to make decisions for the people who so proudly elected us, the most important of which has long been considered to be the selection of United States Supreme Court Justices. We have this obligation, without delay!,"" he wrote on Twitter on Saturday. Earlier, Mr McConnell said in a statement - which included a tribute to Ginsburg - that ""President Trump's nominee will receive a vote on the floor of the United States Senate"". The senator had argued in 2016 that ""the American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice"" which meant ""this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president"". But now he says the Senate was within its rights to act because it was Republican-controlled, and Mr Trump is a Republican president. Democrats, however, began echoing Mr McConnell's words from 2016.  The Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, sent a tweet repeating his exact phrase, while Mr Biden told reporters: ""There is no doubt - let me be clear - that the voters should pick the president and the president should pick the justice for the Senate to consider."" Ginsburg had also made her feelings clear in the days before her death. ""My most fervent wish is that I will not be replaced until a new president is installed,"" she wrote in a statement to her granddaughter, according to National Public Radio (NPR). Analysis by Laura Trevelyan, presenter, BBC World News America The death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg has injected a new element of volatility into the presidential race, with questions about what it will mean for the already intense battle for the women's vote. Now the future of the landmark Roe v Wade ruling on abortion rights is firmly on the ballot. President Trump, who polling suggests has been steadily losing support among college-educated women ever since he was elected, has been making a play for what he calls the suburban housewife.  For conservative women, especially evangelicals, who have doubts about his character, the importance of the right to life may be an important factor. If the Republican nominee for the Supreme Court is a woman, this could also be a way for him to appeal to female voters.  Democrats who successfully won suburban House seats in swing districts in 2018 mostly emphasised that a woman should have the right to control her own body.  The death of the iconic RBG, who did so much to codify legal equality for women, will also be a rallying cry for Democrats, who can say to female voters that those gains are now under threat. In a year which has seen so much turmoil in America over coronavirus and racial justice, now the culture wars over abortion are front and centre too. The highest court in the US is often the final word on highly contentious laws, disputes between states and the federal government, and final appeals to stay executions. In recent years, the court has expanded gay marriage to all 50 states, allowed for President Trump's travel ban to be put in place, and delayed a US plan to cut carbon emissions while appeals went forward. It is also deals with issues like reproductive rights - one of the main reasons some pro-life conservatives want to tip the balance away from liberals."
Volatility,Madoff investigator accuses GE of $38bn fraud,2024-09-25,2019-08-15,By Russell Hotten,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-49352765,"A private financial investigator who flagged warnings about Bernard Madoff's $65bn Ponzi scheme is now targeting one of America's blue chip companies. In a 175-page report Harry Markopolos claimed General Electric (GE) was hiding an accounting scandal. He accused GE of concealing $38.1bn in potential losses and alleged the company's cash situation was far worse than disclosed. GE called it ""meritless, misguided and self-serving speculation"". Chief executive Lawrence Culp also accused Mr Markopolos of ""false statements of fact"" and said he had not checked his facts with GE before publishing. Mr Markopolos's analysis of GE's financial position, called General Electric: A Bigger Fraud Than Enron, claims: ""The $38bn in accounting fraud amounts to over 40% of GE's market capitalization, making it far more serious than either the Enron or WorldCom accounting frauds.""  The report highlights the conglomerate's exposure to long-term care insurance in the US and its oil industry services business. Mr Markopolos's referencing of two of corporate America's most notorious frauds in the report was seen as potentially serious, as both led to criminal prosecutions.  GE's share price fell 15% on Thursday following news of the report and an appearance by Mr Markopolos on the CNBC television network. The stock closed down 11%, GE's worse one-day fall in 11 years. As a sign of faith in his company, Mr Culp bought $2m worth of GE shares, according to reports. Mr Markopolos disclosed that he had given an advance copy of his report to an unnamed hedge fund, and would receive a percentage of the profits from any share price movement. Some analysts dismissed the report, with John Hempton, co-founder of the Bronte Capital hedge fund calling it ""silly"". However, Reuters noted that there are Wall Street analysts who have long been concerned about claims of GE's low cash flow, charges and asset writedowns, and alleged opaque financial reports. In the past two years GE has announced more than $40bn in writedowns and accounting charges. The company has also disclosed that its accounting is being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice. Mr Culp told reporters in the US that Mr Markopolos' report contained factual errors and constituted ""market manipulation - pure and simple"", because the investigator stood to profit from short-selling tied to its release. Earlier, GE issued a robust response to Mr Markopolos: ""We remain focused on running our business every day and... will not be distracted by this type of meritless, misguided and self-serving speculation."" The company said it ""stands behind its financials"" and operates to the ""highest-level of integrity"" in its financial reporting. ""Mr Markopolos openly acknowledges that he is compensated by unnamed hedge funds. Such funds are financially motivated to attempt to generate short selling in a company's stock to create unnecessary volatility."" He is best known for alerting regulators in the early 2000s to signs that money manager Bernard Madoff's investment firm was a Ponzi scheme, a deception in which unusually high returns for early investors are generated with money from later investors.  Madoff was arrested in 2008 and later sentenced to 150 years in prison for the fraud."
Volatility,Airport's £500m expansion plan unveiled,2024-09-25,2018-11-06,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-birmingham-46110346,"Birmingham Airport has announced an ambitious £500m expansion plan to grow passengers numbers by 40% over the next 15 years. In a bid to become one of Europe's leading regional airports, bosses want to attract 18 million passengers by 2033, up from the current 13 million. The plan will mean more long and short haul flights, a larger terminal, new aircraft stands but no new runway. The airport said it was confident airlines would follow demand. HS2, the £55.7bn planned high-speed rail link, initially running between London and Birmingham by 2026, as well as additional capacity on the West Coast Mainline will help increase passenger numbers, the airport said. HS2 will cut rail journeys between the airport and central London from the current 70 minutes to 38. A new junction on the nearby M42 motorway will also benefit those travelling by car, bosses said. Simon Richards, acting managing director, said: ""Over the next 15 years, we will expand and significantly improve the airport to maximise our potential as a single runway airport by investing £500m.  ""Our plans take account of our forecast growth and will increase operational efficiency for our airlines and partners and improve the experience for our passengers."" Peter Plisner, BBC Midlands Business and Transport Correspondent  Growth in aviation has continued apace, despite several recessions and passenger rises at Birmingham Airport appear to have followed a similar pattern.  Having said that, current projections are lower than when the last airport masterplan was published. Back in 2007, it was thought there would be 27 million passengers per year by 2030. Now it's just 18 million.  Clearly the projections have been reworked and the recent collapses of airlines like Monarch and Primera Air, probably haven't helped.  It was thought the plan might include a bid for a controversial second runway, but in light of a third runway at Heathrow and a lower than expected passenger forecast those plans have been kicked into the long grass.  Environmentalists will be pleased with that news but they're still opposed to the latest masterplan. Mr Richards said the growth was achievable despite industry volatility, including the collapse of budget airline Primera Air, which operated out of Birmingham until last month. ""The aviation industry has always been like that,"" he said. ""Some airlines do come and go, we are conscious of that. ""But we have a set of airline partners with great stability all the way through the economic downturn since 2008 with actually very stable volumes, that's most of [our] airlines partners, and that's the firm foundations on which we'll build."" A 12-week public consultation on the expansion is now under way."
Volatility,Plaid switch focus to 'make Brexit work for Wales',2024-09-25,2020-01-26,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-51252914,"Plaid Cymru is now focused on making Brexit work for Wales ""as best we can"", according to the party's leader. Adam Price said it had been in Wales' best interests for Plaid to oppose the UK's departure from the European Union in December's general election. But with the UK set to leave the EU on 31 January, he said there was no need to ""fight yesterday's battles"". Mr Price added there could be ""new freedoms and flexibilities"" for Wales as a result of Brexit. ""There's no point in us now rehearsing arguments of the past,"" Mr Price said. ""The prime minister has his majority, he will implement the [Brexit] policy that he set out.  ""It's very important we minimise some of the negative effects that could have on the Welsh economy but also we need to reflect the fact that we're in a different political context now and we need to look at making this work for Wales as best we can.  ""There are, for example, some new freedoms and flexibilities as a result of leaving the European Union. ""Instead of all of those powers and levers remaining at Westminster then, we need to make the case for Wales to have those levers."" In an interview on BBC Politics Wales, Mr Price outlined some of the demands he will make in a speech in Cardiff on Monday. They include giving the Development Bank of Wales the ability to lend money without the constraints of the EU's state aid rules and calling for the devolution of corporation tax, VAT and air passenger duty. In last month's election, Plaid Cymru retained the four seats they held before the campaign but failed to manage second place in any other Welsh seat and saw its share of the vote fall by 0.5%. However the Carmarthen East and Dinefwr AM believes ""political volatility"" could present an opportunity in the national assembly elections next year. ""We would have liked to have done better. It was no triumph and no tragedy,"" he said. ""The conversations I've had since the election with people, many liked what I had to say [but] many voted tactically in an election dominated by the two Westminster parties, but they will be voting for us in May 2021.  ""There's potential there. The traditional party allegiances, it seems, are not the dominant force that they once were and that creates an opportunity for us."""
Volatility,School curriculum terms of review published,2024-09-25,2020-02-26,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-51644366,"The terms of a review of the Curriculum for Excellence system used in Scottish schools have been published. The Scottish government has tasked the The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) with carrying out an independent study of the senior phase of education. It will report back to ministers in February 2021. The review was widened after MSPs voted to call for a fuller examination of ""key weaknesses"" in schooling. Education Secretary John Swinney said he ""firmly believes"" that the current system is ""the right approach"". And he said the review must not be a ""distraction"" from work to close the attainment gap between students from more and less affluent backgrounds. Mr Swinney ordered a review of the senior phase of Scottish education in September 2019 following a critical report from a Holyrood committee. It said there had been a ""lack of clear leadership"" from officials and ""some narrowing of subject choice"". Mr Swinney was subsequently forced to widen this study to include earlier years of schooling after opposition MSPs defeated the government in a Holyrood vote, saying there were ""key weaknesses in some key aspects of Scotland's school education"" system. Documents released by the government showed a decline in the exam performance of pupils in core Higher subjects in 2019, in some cases by as much as 10%. On Tuesday, Mr Swinney insisted that pupils had achieved a ""strong set of results"" in exams, and that changes were explained by annual ""volatility"". And he said the design of the curriculum would be a ""key focus of the review"", including ""the approach to assessment, qualifications and other achievements and how well they articulate with the curriculum, learning and teaching"". Opposition MSPs have been critical of the government's approach, with Labour's Iain Gray saying the remit of the review was ""extremely disappointing"" and ""an attempt to avoid scrutiny of problems"". The review will also take account of the views of teachers and pupils, with Mr Swinney saying ""the voice of young people"" would be ""an important part of the review"". He added: ""While every education system must be open to further improvement, I am also clear the review should not be a distraction or create uncertainty. This is a review of the curriculum, not Scottish education.  ""We have embarked on reforms that are working to close the attainment gap, raise standards and are sustainable for the long term. There is still much to do, but I believe we are on the right track."" The review will include a look at two major issues which have been the subject of some debate. One is how well the early years of secondary school - the Broad General Education - prepare students for S4, S5 and S6 when they study for qualifications. The other is over how much local flexibility there should be. This touches on the discussion over how many qualifications S4 students should be able to obtain. Some schools offer the chance to do six, others seven. A few offer up to nine or try to bypass S4 qualifications completely. This has led some parents to claim their children could be disadvantaged or face a restricted choice of subjects. Others point out that what matters is what a young person has achieved by the time they leave school - not by the end of a particular year.  The direction of travel in recent years has been to try to empower headteachers so any move away from local decision making would seem unlikely. The report is due in February 2021 - three months before the Holyrood elections. One question is the extent to which it may influence the manifestos of the SNP or the other parties."
Volatility,The last hours - the election conclusions,2024-09-25,2017-06-07,By Laura Kuenssberg,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2017-40184817,"Caveat, caveat, caveat, and in case you haven't realised the point I'm trying to make yet, here is another caveat. Elections matter because they determine all our futures based on the decisions made by millions of people in the privacy of the polling booth. The results are not based on what the pollsters say, nor entirely on what happens in the rough and tumble of election campaigns, nor what any journalist or pundit says. Nor is the outcome in a time of political volatility predictable in any traditional sense.  So, anyone now making guesses about the final outcome of the election is doing just that, guessing, even if those guesses are of the most informed kind.  With those caveats in mind though, we have spent the last few weeks travelling the country with political leaders, talking to voters, and also talking to dozens of candidates who have been on the doorstep trying to secure the vote for their parties. And it is worth exploring the broad conclusions that many of them share. The first point worth making is that generally, most of them share the same view of the big picture. Irrespective of the Tories' dispiriting campaign, irrespective of the very obvious enthusiasm shown by many thousands of Jeremy Corbyn's supporters, experienced campaigners across the political spectrum believe the Conservatives are almost inevitably going to be the largest party.  Even the inner core of Mr Corbyn's supporters don't really believe the overall outcome is very likely to be different. And the London Bridge attacks make it difficult for any of the political parties to shift the debate beyond security or Brexit, or build new momentum in these closing hours.  One cabinet minister did suggest privately, ""it is possible"" that they might not end up being the largest overall party, but ""when you get down to Brexit it's a yes, and it's all down to Theresa May"". Without question though, there has been a hardening of what had felt like a super soft Labour vote. The local election results suggested that it wasn't just UKIP voters likely to make the switch to the Conservatives, but normal Labour voters who were willing to make the jump straight across.  Again and again, whether in Wales, or the Midlands, or the North East, we heard voters say ""I'm normally Labour, but…"" contemplating voting Conservative for the first time. That was certainly partly down to the public perception of Jeremy Corbyn. Labour campaigners reported a vitriolic reaction to Jeremy Corbyn in many places. One candidate texted in shock to say, ""you can't overestimate how unpopular he is on the doorsteps"".  Labour, Tory, SNP, or Lib Dem we heard this time and again. Whatever the picture the national polls suggest, some Labour candidates still believe their party could be looking at a dreadful set of results with the party crashing to well below 200 seats.  Most we've spoken to believe the party will go backwards, the question is by how much.  There has been a hardening of the Labour vote since the opening days of this battle, but as one source puts it the party's view was ""we started 90 seats behind"".  Another senior source says ""the scale of the drop in our support feels bigger than the scale of the recent increase, while the Tory vote has grown and the Lib Dems have disappeared"". But one look at the thousands of rain soaked supporters in Gateshead, students climbing up trees to see the Labour leader over the crowds in Leeds, queues outside so many of the venues where he has appeared, tells you that he has massively enthused some voters, particularly students and the young. Over the course of the campaign it's been Labour with most of the momentum, the more enthusiastic crowds, and the more radical agenda.   Nearly every private conversation with candidates reveals this too. There's been surprise in Tory ranks that the overall  tone of the campaign has been a positive for Mr Corbyn, rather than the onslaught they expected and sought to promote with highly personalised attacks from the get go. And for the large number of Labour doubters, there's been disbelief at how he has performed. For many of his supporters however, this is what they always believed could happen. When his policies got more exposure, and more people saw him in the context of a campaign, more and more voters would be drawn to his radical offer. But excited crowds don't translate directly into election victories. In the Scottish referendum for example, it was those campaigning for independence who had the excitement, the energy, the visible drive, yet they lost by 10 points. At this point in the General Election in 2015, it was Labour campaigners with hope in their eyes, Ed Miliband's team joking privately about giving out invites to Chequers. Yet the party went backwards.  What do the parties themselves really think is going on? Remember they have their own huge swathes of data gathered door-knock by door-knock that informs their decisions. The most basic of all - where it is worth turning up to campaign. Parties don't traditionally send their leaders to places where they think they have no chance of winning, or where they don't think they are in danger of losing. Essentially, leaders only go to seats that are in play. So consider the pattern of where Mr Corbyn has been visiting - the huge crowds have often been in Labour-held seats. For perhaps the biggest clue in this election look at the trail of the leaders' visits themselves. Jeremy Corbyn has been to 63 seats - 27 Labour including 20 safe seats, 34 Tory seats, 1 SNP and 1 Liberal Democrat. By contrast, Theresa May has visited 62 seats - 41 of them Labour, 15 Tory, 5 SNP and 1 Liberal Democrat. She has been to no safe Tory seat other than her own constituency. The heavy hint from those choices tell you who is playing an attack game, and who is trying to defend their ground.  Indeed one source at the top of the Labour Party told me there are only two seats they believe that are seriously in contention as Labour gains. That is hardly the position of a party that really believes it is in the ascendance. The party's ultimate vote share is a separate question. But in a first-past-the-post system, if Labour wants to inflict damage on the Tories they need to protect seats in the North and make gains in the Midlands. Beyond what the national polls suggest, there is not much convincing evidence that suggest that is what's going on. One senior source suggests Mr Corbyn has sewn up the ""trendy left"". But it's hard to identify how far his appeal has really stretched beyond that in the places where it counts. Still, last night in Birmingham, we've witnessed what was probably one of the biggest political events in decades. Jeremy Corbyn speaking to a crowd in Birmingham, cheered again and again, watched on live screens by many more thousands of voters in five other cities around the country.  Just as when he won the leadership of the Labour Party, his candidacy, and his promises have excited voters for whom the standard political offer of recent years has come up woefully short. For Labour candidates who see this election and its expected result as an opportunity to end his control of the party that enthusiasm is a genie that may be extremely hard to wrangle back into the bottle. Remember that, as with Mr Corbyn's election to the Labour leadership first time round, and the European referendum, we are living through times where traditional political rules are certainly frayed. And if young people defy expectation and turn out to vote in unprecedented numbers any result is possible. One cabinet minister told me today that if the Tories don't win, the polls are ""bonkers"" and voters on the doorsteps have been ""deceitful"" when reporting, whether enthusiastically or grudgingly, that they will put their cross in their box. Yet perhaps either way, the events of this campaign will be felt across the spectrum for years to come."
Volatility,How small businesses survive global market shocks,2024-09-25,2023-01-05,By Jill Martin Wrenn,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-64151515,"Sherene Headley got a big surprise when she checked the invoice from her manufacturer in China this past autumn. The founder and chief executive of Mokkah, a London-based company that makes shoes in large sizes for women, had ordered 57 pairs of black suede boots to sell to customers. But the manufacturer's invoice, which was priced in US dollars, was about 20% more expensive than Ms Headley had expected. When the British pound sank to a record low against the US dollar in September, her fledgling company's overseas buying power dropped with it. The pound's fall makes goods priced in dollars much more expensive to buy. For any business, that can be a shock; for a new business, it can be debilitating. ""A lot of small businesses, their margins are quite small when they're trying to get their businesses out there,"" Ms Headley says. ""So I knew from the outset that I could never compete with the High Street [on price] because we just haven't got the resources to be able to do that."" From its inception, Mokkah has been a lean, bootstrapped company. Using Crowdfunder, the fundraising platform, Ms Headley raised £13,000 in June 2020, to launch the firm. Thanks to advice from her business mentor, Ms Headley prices her products high enough to protect against unexpected increased costs. ""Luckily for me, who is new to business, I was able to put some measures in place so my selling rate for the UK would work out OK, even with this increased conversion,"" Ms Headley says. ""It would still allow me the space to be able to be like, 'this is what I could plug back in to get another pair of shoes, or another sample made'."" While the pound has stabilised since September, it is still historically low against the US dollar. More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade. You might think that this would help Ms Headley boost exports to the US, as her shoes are cheaper to buy in dollars than they would be if the pound was higher. However, the weak pound has meant that the cost of global shipping has risen sharply for UK exporters. ""The real challenge I would say, when it does come, is if I was to increase my sales abroad,"" says Ms Headley. ""At the moment, I do have quite a few customers that buy from America, but the bulk of my sales are here in the UK."" For small manufacturers in the US, the high value of the dollar makes their products more expensive for overseas customers, making it harder for them to win export orders. Molly Fienning, chief executive of South Carolina-based Red Clay Hot Sauce, says she would still love to expand her company's overseas sales in the years ahead. ""We need to find that right [overseas] partner,"" she says. ""We want to really own our backyard, and own the South, then own the US, then think about global."" Ms Fienning says that in addition to the currency issue, she has seen the cost of key business expenses, such as the price of cardboard boxes and how much she has to pay freight firms, reach their highest levels since she became chief executive in 2018. To insulate the business from any currency swings, Red Clay only sources its ingredients from within the US. These include sweet peppers, raw honey and white wine vinegar. ""We started with all Southern products, and then as we've scaled, we've needed more peppers and more honey,"" Ms Fienning says. Now, the company sources peppers from up and down the east coast of the US, from Florida to New York, and uses honey manufacturers in Georgia and Colorado. Back in the UK, experts say that currency volatility is just one of numerous challenges for small firms. ""I would say in general small UK companies are being challenged on several fronts,"" says financial commentator Todd Benjamin. ""These include Brexit, a weaker currency if importing materials, higher labour costs due to wage inflation, higher taxation due to the chancellor's announcement in the Autumn Statement, and an economy that is weaker for the foreseeable future."" In Istanbul, Pinar Büyükbalci, associate professor of entrepreneurship at the city's Yildiz Technical University, says that global investors are increasingly wary of investing in emerging economies that have seen their currencies drop sharply against the dollar, such as Turkey and its lira. ""What we have been witnessing over the last year and a half is the very strict and cautious approach of foreign investors, when thinking about making further investment in start-ups in Turkey, and also in all other emerging markets,"" she says. Timuçin Bilgör, the president of the Turkish-based investor network, Buba Ventures, agrees that it is now more difficult for new firms to find overseas investment. ""The challenge is finding money,"" he says, adding that investors want to see more proof of success before they take the plunge.  With higher interest global rates, funds are also now more expensive. ""The money is not cheap anymore,"" says Mr Bilgör.  The bottom line for new businesses is to prepare for anything, and to try to add padding to prices to allow for shocks. ""So when it came to me creating my brand, luckily I was able to build in certain room for issues,"" says Mokkah's Ms Headley. ""I didn't really expect it to be a currency thing, and I'm hoping that with time it starts to improve."""
Volatility,How will history judge President Trump?,2024-09-25,2019-01-17,By Nick Bryant,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-46895634,"Hostile historians may come to regard Donald Trump's presidency as an aggregation of the lesser traits of his predecessors.  The bullying of Lyndon Baines Johnson, who demeaned White House aides and even humiliated his Vice-President Hubert Humphrey - forcing his deputy once to recite a speech on Vietnam while he listened, legs akimbo, trousers round his ankles, on the toilet.  The intellectual incuriosity of Ronald Reagan, who once apologised to his then White House Chief of Staff James Baker for not reading his briefing books with the immortal excuse: ""Well, Jim, The Sound of Music was on last night."" The shameless lies of Bill Clinton about his affair with Monica Lewinsky. The paranoia of Richard Nixon, who in his final days railed, King Lear-like, at portraits hanging on the White House walls. The incompetence of George W Bush, whose failure to master basic governance partly explained his administration's botched response to the aftermath of the war in Iraq and also to Hurricane Katrina. The historical amnesia of Gerald Ford, whose assertion during a 1976 presidential debate that Eastern Europe was not dominated by Moscow was a forerunner of Trump's recent endorsement of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. The strategic impatience of Barack Obama, whose instinct always was to withdraw US forces from troublesome battlefields, such as Iraq, even if the mission had not yet been completed. Even the distractedness of John F Kennedy, who whiled away afternoons in the White House swimming pool with a bevy of young women to sate his libido, a sexualised version, perhaps, of Donald Trump sitting for his hours in front of his flat-screen TV watching friendly right-wing anchors massage his ego.  At the midpoint of Donald Trump's first term, historians have struggled to detect the kind of virtues that offset his predecessors' vices: the infectious optimism of Reagan; the inspirational rhetoric of JFK; the legislative smarts of LBJ; or the governing pragmatism of Nixon. So rather than being viewed as the reincarnation of Ronald Reagan or Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Trump gets cast as a modern-day James Buchanan, Franklin Pierce or William Harrison. Last year, a poll of nearly 200 political science scholars, which has routinely placed Republicans higher than Democrats, ranked him 44th out of the 44 men who have occupied the post (for those wondering why Trump is the 45th president, Grover Cleveland served twice).  Though the president has likened himself to Abraham Lincoln, who posterity has deemed to be greatest of all presidents, this survey judged him to be the worst of the worst. Even the conservative scholars, who identified themselves as Republicans, placed him 40th. Were it not for his braggadocio, Donald Trump might receive a more positive historical press. A recurring problem, after all, is that he gets judged against his boasts. He can point to a significant record of right-wing accomplishment.  Tax reform. Two Supreme Court nominees safely installed on the bench. The travel ban. The bonfire of federal regulations. Criminal justice reform. Legislative action aimed at ameliorating the opioid crisis. Nato members ponying up more cash. Annual wage growth is at a nine-year high. 2018 was the best year for job creation since 2015. Many of his campaign pledges, such as the renegotiation of the Nafta free-trade agreement and the relocation of the US embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, have been kept. Promise made, promise kept is one of his boasts that regularly rings true.  Often, though, he blunts the impact of authentic good news with inflated claims. US Steel is not opening up six new plants. He is not the author of the biggest tax cut in American history. Besides, the trade war has penalised US manufacturers and farmers, and in 2018 the stock market suffered its worst year since the 2008 financial meltdown.  This market volatility highlights other Trump tendencies contributing to his poor reviews: pointing to a buoyant stock market as a metric of personal success, the downside of which is the downswing; and blaming others when things go south, in this case the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell. Trump sits in the Oval Office behind what's called the Resolute desk, hewn from the timber of an abandoned British warship and first used by John F Kennedy, a former navy man himself. But on it you will not find the desk sign favoured by Harry S Truman: ""The Buck Stops Here.""  This America First president is himself an American first. Indeed, a further reason for the disdain of historians is because, historically speaking, his administration has been like no other. The chaos of staff turnover - two secretaries of state, two secretaries of defence, two attorneys general, three White House chiefs of staff, and a revolving door of senior West Wing aides. The foreign policy by tweet. The chumminess with adversarial authoritarian leaders, such as Kim Jong-un and Vladimir Putin. The blurring of ethical lines supposedly separating the Trump White House from the Trump business empire. The Russia collusion investigation, which has raised questions, so far unsettled, about his true allegiance.  Nor have we ever witnessed a US leader who has so flagrantly flouted the normal rules of presidential behaviour. The playground nicknames. The Twitter tirades. The ugly slurs - ""horseface"" for Stormy Daniels, a former porn star with whom he was once apparently intimate. In response to indictments in the Mueller probe, he has sometimes sounded more like the boss of a crime family. ""A rat"" is how he described his former lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen, deploying the lingua franca of the Mafioso.  Though he claims to offer exemplary moral leadership, even conservatives have criticised his presidency for being a profile of amorality, whether in response to the murder of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi or the neo-Nazi torchlight protest in Charlottesville. One of my abiding memories from the past two years came in the lobby of Trump Tower during that extraordinary press availability held a few days afterwards, when he suggested a ""very fine people"" equivalence between far-right protesters and their opponents. Standing next to me was an African-American cameraman, who abandoned his tripod so that he could join reporters in hurling questions, something that rarely, if ever, happens at press conferences. ""What should I tell my children?"" he shouted. ""What should I tell my children?""  With each bizarre press encounter and each ALL CAPS tweet, it can sometimes feel as if America is living through some historical counterfactual. It is as if the right-wing populist Pat Buchanan managed to beat George Herbert Walker Bush to the Republican presidential nomination in 1992 and, on the strength of his fiery culture war speech to the GOP convention, went on to beat Bill Clinton. Buchanan launched his insurgent campaign with a plea to put ""America First"" and used the mantra ""Make America Great Again."" Or maybe the Trump presidency is what a Perot administration might have looked like. Ross Perot, who also sought the presidency in 1992, was another populist billionaire and deep state conspiracy theorist. Yet even Buchanan and Perot, one suspects, would have been more orthodox. This alternative history feel to the Trump presidency partly explains why some of the dystopian ""Could it happen here?"" novels, such as Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale and George Orwell's 1984 have received a ""Trump bump"" in sales. Phillip Roth's The Plot Against America has also become a touchstone work. It imagines as president the aviator Charles Lindbergh, the telegenic spokesman for the isolationist ""America First Committee,"" who turns the USA into a more authoritarian state. These dystopian analogies, however, are often not analogous. Donald Trump's America is not Margaret Atwood's Gilead, or George Orwell's Oceania. And just as the billionaire unwisely compares himself to the heroes of history, a trait which inevitably invites ridicule, his more strident critics over-reach when they liken him to history's worst villains. He is not a modern-day Adolf Hitler, nor an American Mussolini.  When Donald Trump took the oath of office, nobody should have been surprised that an anti-politician would morph into an anti-president. In 2016 Americans rejected politics as usual. And diehard supporters still throng his rallies, wearing Make America Great Again caps and chanting for him to build the wall and lock up Hillary Clinton. His approval ratings among Republicans remain strong - 88% according to Gallup. His overall approval rating - 37% according to Gallup - is on a par with Ronald Reagan's at the two-year mark. Yet the rally chants of ""four more years"" remain a wish rather than a prophecy, and the setbacks suffered by the Republicans in November's congressional elections point to an underlying weakness: the disaffection of moderate Republicans, who were never enthusiastic about Donald Trump but who refused to countenance Hillary Clinton as president. Trump remains the only president in the history of the Gallup poll not to crack the 50% threshold.  Because Donald Trump is unwilling to accept he is anything other than an A+ president, the grade he has bestowed upon himself, he is not prepared to adopt the kind of correctives that have saved troubled presidencies. JFK learnt from the disaster of the Bay of Pigs and the bullying he received from Nikita Khrushchev at the Vienna summit in 1961, which was followed in short order by the Soviet construction of the Berlin Wall. Confronted a year later with the Cuban Missile Crisis, he was less trusting of his generals, who urged airstrikes, and less willing to be pushed around by Khrushchev.  Bill Clinton, who was accused of liberal over-reach during his first months in office and was punished as a result in the 1994 mid-term elections, tacked back to the political centre in time to win re-election in 1996. This is not a learning presidency. Incumbents can also benefit from self-doubt, a trait Donald Trump seems to regard as a character flaw. Presidents also usually grow in office. But while there are physical signs the 72-year-old is ageing - unable to holiday in Florida over Christmas, he has looked especially tired these past few days - there is little sign he is maturing.   It does not help that so many senior figures within his administration and his party treat him like a child monarch. The cabinet meeting where holders of the highest offices of state went around the table lavishing praise upon the president felt like Pyongyang on the Potomac. Vice-President Mike Pence has perfected the devoted gaze of the prototypical political wife. Senior Republicans, who privately roll their eyes, have been admiring, even sycophantic, in his presence. For the most part, international leaders have also opted for obsequiousness. Not only did Theresa May rush to Washington to invite Trump for a state visit - a state visit that has still not been diarised - she telephoned him on Air Force One to congratulate him after the mid-term election, even though the Democrats regained the House of Representatives. All this after Trump has frequently undermined her leadership over Brexit and trampled over the special relationship. One of the reasons Mr Trump is said to look so contemptuously upon Angela Merkel is because she makes so little effort to conceal her contempt for him. At the two-year mark, it is usually clear how incumbents will leave their mark on the presidency. After the torpidity of the Eisenhower years, Kennedy made the office more youthful and glamorous. Johnson, that shrewd ""Master of the Senate"", brought the executive and legislative branches into closer alignment. Nixon consolidated more power in the White House, accelerating the trend the liberal historian Arthur M Schlesinger Jr dubbed ""the imperial presidency.""  Ford reversed much of that process, even going as far to drop the playing of ""Hail to the Chief"" when he made an entrance. The cardigan-wearing Jimmy Carter, who used to go from room to room turning off lights to save energy, suburbanised the White House. Reagan, who restored many of the ceremonial trappings, erased the lines between politics and entertainment.  Clinton, in the age of Oprah, made the office more empathetic, narrowing the emotional distance between the presidency and the people. Obama set a new standard for ethical behaviour - motivated in part by the African-American mantra of working twice as hard to get half as far - and also made the presidency more hip. By abrogating behavioural customs, Donald Trump has made the presidency more uncouth and less trustworthy. By departing from executive and managerial norms, he has made domestic and foreign policy-making more impulsive and disorderly. By fraying traditional alliances, he has made the US presidency more isolated. By threatening to declare a national emergency in the funding row over his wall along the Mexican border, he has also indicated a willingness to discard constitutional norms that could mean exceeding constitutional limits.  The cumulative effect of this has been to make the Oval Office a focal point of perpetual turmoil and uncertainty, with the White House hostage to the changing whims and temper of its occupant. Governing sometimes feels secondary to winning political and cultural battles, and slaying opponents.  His presidency has become a roiling permanent campaign. Will his impact bring about more permanent changes? That will depend, to a large extent, on whether or not he wins a second term. Defeat in 2020 would represent a repudiation of his leadership style. Victory would be validating. Yet even as a one-term president, Trump would have changed the character of the presidency and US politics more broadly.  While it is hard to imagine America's 46th or 47th presidents unleashing the same barrage of insults, there are already signs of a ""Trump effect"" on political discourse. Many mid-term races featured unusually ugly rhetoric. Hours after being sworn in as a new Democratic congresswoman, Rashida Tlaib used a profane epithet as she called for the president's impeachment. What is known as the Overton window, the broadly agreed parameters of acceptable public discourse, has shifted to the right. I well remember the moment during the 2016 campaign when an email from the Trump campaign dropped into our inboxes announcing he would ban all Muslims from entering the United States. Initially we thought it might have been a hoax, for it seemed so far outside the mainstream of American political thought. Now, though, calls for a Muslim ban would raise eyebrows and provoke protests but hardly drop jaws.  The phrase ""Trump has normalised the abnormal"" has itself become a cliché. Still, though, I am constantly struck by how many Trump stories and scandals that ordinarily would have launched months, even years, of critical coverage for previous presidents sometimes barely last a single news cycle. More long-lasting could be the debasement of facts as the basis for debate and policy formulation. By its own admission, this administration has sometimes deployed what the White House aide Kellyanne Conway memorably labelled ""alternative facts"", starting on day one with false claims about the size of the inauguration crowd. Since then, the Washington Post has listed more than 7,000 presidential falsehoods. But an unsettling lesson of the Trump presidency is that post-truth politics can be highly effective, especially when it comes to shoring up a political base.  As for chaotic governance, future administrations will surely be more stable in terms of staff turnover, and more orderly when it comes to forming and executing policy. But it is easy to imagine Trump's successors pushing the bounds of executive authority in ways that breach constitutional norms, especially now that gridlock on Capitol Hill has become such a permanent feature of Washington politics.  Obama, to a howl of protests from congressional Republicans, relied heavily on executive orders, the flourish of his presidential pen. Trump has gone a big step further by threatening to invoke emergency powers to bypass a hostile Congress. Stress tests for the US constitution, even full-blown constitutional crises, could easily become more commonplace.  The Trump presidency's first drafts of history - most notably Bob Woodward's bestseller Fear - have painted a portrait of unprecedented dysfunction. If former senior administration officials pen honest participant histories - say former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, ex-Secretary of Defence James Mattis or former chief of staff John Kelly - they are likely, if their parting comments offer any guide, to add more detail and texture to that same picture.  If some of the renowned presidential biographers turn their attention to Trump - maybe Jon Meacham, David McCullough or Michael Beschloss, who in the past have rescued the reputations of under-rated presidents such as George Herbert Walker Bush and Harry S Truman - they are unlikely to deliver laudatory manuscripts. The histories already written, along with those taking shape, will someday be housed in the Donald J Trump Presidential Library, an addition to the 13 existing presidential libraries that form part of the National Archive. Will it be a landmark to US greatness or a modern-day American folly? Even with two years left to run of this history-defying presidency, most Americans, one suspects, have already made up their minds. Follow Nick Bryant on Twitter ."
Volatility,50 Cent discovers his Bitcoin millions,2024-09-25,2018-01-25,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42820246,"50 Cent has discovered that he is a Bitcoin millionaire, thanks to some long-forgotten album sales. In 2014, he released the album Animal Ambition and became the first artist to accept Bitcoin as payment. The rapper received more than 700 Bitcoins under the deal, but then forgot about the cryptocurrency, according to celebrity news site TMZ. The hoard is worth $7-$8m, although the currency's price volatility means that could change fast. In 2014, one Bitcoin was equivalent to about $662, but was worth about $11,200 on Thursday according to Coindesk. ""Not bad for a kid from South Side, I'm so proud of me,"" 50 Cent - whose real name is Curtis Jackson - wrote on Instagram, confirming the news in a post that featured a screenshot of the TMZ article. 50 Cent also posted a picture of himself on Instagram surrounded by Bitcoins, with the caption: ""A little bit coin anyone? LOL. l know l make you sick but excuse me I'm getting to the bag.""  Over the last 12 months, several celebrities have been paid to promote and endorse various virtual currencies on social media. In September, Hollywood actor Jamie Foxx promoted the sale of cryptocurrencies on a trading exchange called Cobinhood. And in October, US rapper Ghostface Killah, of the rap group Wu-Tang Clan, co-founded Cream Capital - a start-up aiming to develop a network of blockchain ATM cash machines for turning cryptocurrencies into cash for withdrawal.  Recently, French reality star Nabilla appeared on Snapchat on 12 January to encourage her fans to invest in Bitcoin. ""Even if you do not know anything about it, it makes money without investing much,"" she said, according to French financial newspaper Les Échos.  But Nabilla's video caused concern at the French regulator L'Autorité des Marchés Financiers, which promptly tweeted a warning that people do not to invest in Bitcoin due to the risks involved. "
Volatility,Migrant children crisis: The big picture explained,2024-09-25,2018-06-20,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-44532437,"""Severely neglected"" children detained in what have been called squalid conditions, as well as deaths on the US-Mexico border, have brought the treatment of migrants into focus in the US. Lawyers who visited a border patrol facility in Clint, Texas, have described overcrowded cells, with children locked up without adult supervision or sufficient access to food or showers. The border authority has said it is trying to provide the ""best care possible"", but that it ""urgently"" needs additional funding to help the children, some of whom entered the US independently, and some of whom have been separated from their families. But why this is happening, and why now? Here, we have looked at three key pieces of context that will help you understand the fuller picture.  The numbers of people from Latin America seeking protection in the US and being held at the border are rising. There is not one specific reason why people are leaving Central America and Mexico for the US. But there are a few that are cited regularly. Reason one: Violence ""We leave our countries under threat. We leave behind our home, our relatives, our friends."" Maritza Flores, from El Salvador, was one of about 1,200 people who travelled in a so-called ""caravan"" of migrants north through Mexico in 2018, headed for the US border.  ""Many people think we left because we are criminals,"" Ms Flores told the BBC at the time. ""We're not criminals - we're people living in fear in our countries. All we want is a place where our children can run free - where they're not afraid to go out to the shops."" Gang violence is rife in El Salvador and Honduras. According to the most recent UN figures, the two nations had the two highest homicide rates in the world in 2016. Rights groups cite the influence of armed gangs who act with impunity - as well as the targeting of women and LGBTI people - as key factors for the high homicide rates. Among the most prevalent groups is MS-13, a brutal street gang that started in the US but is now thought to have at least 60,000 members in Central America. The gang is said to recruit at-risk and poor teenagers and demand they commit murder as an initiation rite, often using a machete. In El Salvador, MS-13 controls entire neighbourhoods. Over the past few years, there has been a significant increase in the number of people travelling to the US because they fear persecution by gangs like MS-13. While persecution is not the only reason people from Central America migrate to the US - economic volatility, natural disasters and the desire to join family members have also been cited by aid groups - there is evidence it is a growing factor, and a credible one. People seeking asylum in the US can request a ""credible fear"" interview if returning home would put their life at risk. An asylum officer then tries to establish if their request is based on a fear of persecution based on race, religion, nationality, political beliefs or membership of a particular group, including a gang. In the 2012 fiscal year, there were 13,880 credible fear applications. In 2018, according to US Citizenship and Immigration Services, there were 99,035 applications, and the vast majority were deemed to be justified in both years. In 2018, the highest number of credible fear applications came from citizens of Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. The UN refugee agency says that those three countries have all ""experienced a dramatic escalation in organised crime by gangs"" that have turned parts of the countries into ""some of the most dangerous places on earth"". Far from striking down credible fear applications, the Trump administration is granting them at an unprecedented rate. But Mr Trump has been keen to raise the threshold for what counts as ""credible fear"". In 2017, the attorney-general at the time, Jeff Sessions, said the system had been exploited.  A year later, he issued a ruling that said victims of domestic abuse and gang violence should no longer generally qualify for asylum in the US - although this was eventually struck down by a judge. But the US isn't the only country to which people are fleeing in large numbers. About 294,000 refugees from north and central America were registered worldwide during 2017, an increase of 58% on the previous year. ""We hear repeatedly from people requesting refugee protection, including from a growing number of children, that they are fleeing forced recruitment into armed criminal gangs and death threats,"" a UN statement said. As the number of people requesting credible fear interviews has increased, so too has the number of people being detained at the US border.  In May 2019, 144,278 people were held or denied entry while trying to cross the border, compared with 51,862 in the same month the year before. Reason two: Escaping poverty One UN survey of a group of migrants in January 2019 again found many were fleeing violence - 68.3% said they had had to change homes due to incidents related to violence or insecurity in the preceding 12 months. But 68% also said they were moving for better labour opportunities, and 12% for education opportunities. Countries in Central America are among the poorest in the world while the US is one of the richest, with the world's largest economy (by GDP): President Trump has repeatedly condemned economic migrants, saying two months after he launched his candidacy that ""they're taking our manufacturing jobs, they're taking our money."" However, many studies say that immigration produces net gains for the US economy. Those entering the US for a better quality of life are not considered refugees. However, US and international law currently says that people can seek asylum if they fear persecution at home on the basis of their race, political opinion, nationality, religion or because they belong to a particular social group. There's another factor to bear in mind too: climate change. With economies that are heavily reliant on agriculture, Central American countries are particularly vulnerable to changes in temperature and the weather. A number of recent reports - including a series by the New Yorker magazine - have acknowledged the role climate change is already playing in driving people from Central America. But one World Bank report last year said the number of people displaced because of climate change in Latin America could rise to 2.1 million by 2050. To understand the zero-tolerance policy on immigration, it helps to understand who is behind it. When Donald Trump announced his candidacy for the White House on 16 June, 2015, he set the tone for how he would later approach the presidency.  ""When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best,"" he said. ""They're sending people that have lots of problems... They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people."" And so, in early 2018, Mr Trump announced a ""zero tolerance"" policy to prosecute all adults who try to cross the US-Mexico border illegally, including those who planned to seek asylum in the US. Mr Trump often cites the dangers of MS-13, which sprung up among Salvadorean immigrants in 1980s Los Angeles and has since spread to at least 46 states. Mr Trump has called them ""animals"" and threatened to rid the US of their influence.  He has focused closely on immigration since becoming president, repeating many of the same claims he made on the day he ran for office. He has backed proposals to cut the number of legal immigrants to the US by 50% over the next 10 years, and by cracking down on immigration, he is not just sticking to a campaign promise, but playing to his base: his core supporters. A Washington Post - ABC News poll in April 2019 found that 63% of Republicans said they were more likely to support Mr Trump for re-election in 2020 given his handling of illegal immigration. However, the same poll found that his approach was less popular with Americans overall - with 44% of adults saying his approach made them more likely to oppose him, compared with 31% who were supportive. The zero tolerance policy also reveals the influence of one man in particular: Mr Trump's senior policy adviser, Stephen Miller, an immigration hardliner tasked with putting the president's words into actions. Mr Miller, one of the president's few original aides to keep their job, was the person who put together the ban on immigrants from majority-Muslim countries announced soon after Mr Trump came to office. The New York Times reported that in April 2018, when it became clear that the number of people being held at the border was growing significantly, Mr Miller pushed for a harder line on immigration. ""It was a simple decision,"" he told the New York Times. ""The message is that no-one is exempt from immigration law."" His position in 2019 is even more secure than a year earlier when the border crackdown began, thanks partly to the departure of immigration officials who supported less restrictive policies. Is it legal to separate families and detain children in poor conditions? This question goes to the centre of the debate on immigration and is not as easy to answer as you may think. Firstly, the policy of family separations at the border - a Trump policy, despite his claims to the contrary - ended after the initial outcry in 2018 with the president signing an executive order, then a judge separately ordering the practice to end. So why are some families still being separated? The New York Times has reported that 700 families had been separated in the past year via ""loopholes"" in the court order - when parents have a criminal conviction or a disease, or when it is an aunt, uncle, or sibling accompanying the child. Some parents may themselves be under 18 and also detained.  There is also significant debate about the conditions under which people are being kept. This too is because of a lack of clarity in the law. A 1997 court decision, known as the Flores Settlement Agreement, sets a standard which the US government must follow when it comes to treating migrant children. But the Department of Justice has sought to amend the agreement to allow it to hold children for longer, and has disputed interpretations of the 1997 court decision - most notably, when a government lawyer argued in June 2018 that the order does not specify that detained children be given showers, soap or toothbrushes. As long as children continue to be separated from their families, the legal challenges from both sides are likely to continue. But aside from the loopholes and the legal disputes, plain old bureaucracy also appears to be a problem. Unaccompanied children are by law supposed to be detained for only up to 72 hours. But several reports say many are being kept in detention centres - often in squalid conditions - for much longer, as government agencies struggle to process the vast number of people being held at the border. ""The agents are working their tails off trying to get this squared away,"" one immigration official told the Washington Post in May 2019, ""but it's a daily struggle with the amount of people we're encountering."""
Volatility,Man died after being punched by care home resident,2024-09-25,2022-07-14,By Caroline Lowbridge,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-derbyshire-62166643,"A man died after being punched in the neck by a fellow resident at a care centre for adults, an inquest heard. Robert Chaplin, who was 49, is thought to have had a cardiac arrest due to the stress of the punch and pre-existing cardiac disease. Mr Chaplin and the resident who punched him were both staying at the Morewood Centre in Alfreton, Derbyshire. The inquest heard they got into a disagreement and Mr Chaplin confronted the other resident with raised fists. The other resident, referred to as Witness A, was initially arrested by police on suspicion of murder but was not charged. The coroner, Peter Nieto, said there was evidence Witness A acted in self-defence and had punched Mr Chaplin ""out of fear for his own safety"". ""Robert died due to unsurvivable hypoxic brain injury following prolonged cardiac arrest caused by being punched,"" said Mr Nieto at the inquest in Chesterfield. Mr Chaplin's cause of death was recorded as hypoxic brain injury, the consequences of an altercation and cardiac disease.  The inquest heard Mr Chaplin and Witness A both had learning difficulties and mental health needs. Mr Chaplin had bipolar disorder, autistic spectrum disorder, some physical health problems including scoliosis and diabetes, and had issues with alcohol use. The coroner said there had been some ""volatility"" between the two men on 23 January 2020. Mr Chaplin asked staff for £30 and said he was going to the pub, Mr Nieto said, and when he returned it was ""clear he had drank alcohol"". Mr Chaplin made aggressive comments and confronted Witness A with raised fists, the coroner said. ""The other resident punched Robert in the neck, which caused Robert to fall back onto the floor,"" said the coroner. ""A member of staff had entered the room and tried to separate them and diffuse the situation."" The coroner said Witness A's understanding of the consequences of his actions was ""questionable"" due to his own complex needs. Mr Chaplin was taken to the Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham, where he died on 24 January 2020. The coroner said conclusions of unlawful killing or accident would not be appropriate, and instead gave a narrative conclusion which summarised what had happened.

Volatility,Petrol retailers told to pass on fuel duty cut,2024-09-25,2022-05-17,By Noor Nanji & Simon Browning,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-61484102,"The government has raised concerns that petrol retailers are not passing on the recent cut in fuel duty, after diesel prices hit another record high. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng told petrol bosses the competition regulator is monitoring the situation. However, petrol retailers said their costs had remained high. The Petrol Retailers Association said margins were ""often not enough to cover operating costs"". Chancellor Rishi Sunak implemented the 5p per litre cut in fuel duty in March to reduce the price of fuel for motorists. In a letter to the industry, the business secretary said the public was ""rightly expressing concern about the pace of the increase in prices at the forecourt"". He said people were frustrated that the fuel duty cut ""does not appear to have been passed through to forecourt prices in any visible or meaningful way"". ""It is also unacceptable that different locations even within the same retail chain have widely different prices,"" he wrote. Mr Kwarteng said his officials recently engaged the Competition and Markets Authority about the issue, as a result of ""perceived intransigence to date"". ""I have been reassured that they will not hesitate to use their powers to act against petrol stations if there is evidence that they are infringing competition or consumer law,"" he said. UK diesel prices rose to a record of just over £1.80 a litre on Monday, the RAC said. After the previous record of £1.79 in March following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, prices dipped but have risen again in recent weeks. The RAC said petrol prices went up by nearly 3p a litre since the start of May and were £1.66 a litre on average. It said retailers are taking an average profit of 2p per litre more than before the chancellor's 5p duty cut.  But Gordon Balmer, executive director of the Petrol Retailers Association, which represents independent forecourts, said comparing pump prices against wholesale prices ""only gives a partial picture"". Once ""additional expenses"" such as storage and delivery costs are taken into account alongside the ""volatility of product prices"", retailers' margins are ""often not enough to cover operating costs"", he said. He added that if the government wanted to lower pump prices, it should reduce fuel duty by more than 5p. ""5p per litre did not represent a substantial enough cut to ease the burden of rising prices on motorists,"" he said. ""While the chancellor was announcing it, oil prices rose and effectively cancelled out the reduction. In addition to this,  sales volumes of petrol and diesel are still not back to their pre-pandemic levels. ""Supermarkets and independent fuel retailers are competing vigorously with each other on the thinnest of margins."" The row follows a warning that supermarkets have also not passed on the fuel duty cut and falls in wholesale fuel prices. The RAC motoring group does not believe the top four supermarkets - Asda, Morrisons, Sainsbury's and Tesco - are doing enough to help customers cut their fuel bills. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: ""Despite operating just a fifth of petrol stations in the UK, the big supermarkets are responsible for around half of all fuel sales so how they choose to price petrol and diesel has a huge impact on what drivers end up paying."" He added: ""When wholesale fuel prices fall dramatically it can be enormously frustrating for drivers when pump prices don't start coming down. It normally takes one retailer to effectively 'fire the starting gun' and cut its prices in order for others to follow. ""We know that the biggest retailers tend to be reluctant to reflect falling wholesale prices at the pumps day-to-day, yet they seem to pass on increases quickly when wholesale prices are rising. This can often be to the detriment of drivers."" The RAC believes that supermarkets often wait for long sustained drops in wholesale prices before they cut their forecourt prices. If they cut the retail price too soon and then the wholesale price rises again, they will be forced to reintroduce a higher price which looks bad to customers, according to the motoring organisation. A Sainsbury's spokesperson said: ""We understand that the cost of living is a real challenge for many households and we are committed to helping our customers as much as we can. ""We lowered prices the day the chancellor announced fuel cuts so that our customers could benefit as soon as possible."" Morrisons said it took the full 5p from its prices at 6pm on the day of the chancellor's announcement. Asda and Tesco have not yet responded to the BBC's request for comment."
Volatility,Putin's 'cynical' refugee offer and UK urged to help,2024-09-25,2022-03-08,By BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-the-papers-60656293,"The front page of the Times shows a woman who was wounded when a Russian shell blew apart her home in Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city.  She has lost the sight in one eye and her face is covered in stitches and daubed with green disinfectant.  ""The faces of war are sculpted by flying glass and burning shrapnel"", writes reporter Anthony Loyd after visiting local hospitals.  The Telegraph has accompanied deaf children evacuated from a school in southern Ukraine. Using sign language, one teenager tells the paper that while he cannot hear the shelling, he feels ""the house shaking, everything shaking"" and a ""shock that judders through the bones"". The Financial Times reports Ukraine and the West have ""poured scorn"" on Moscow's offer of safe routes out of besieged cities - after it became clear those routes were to Russia or Belarus. The paper says the concept now leads to ""more fear and terrifying dead ends"" for civilians. The Daily Mail writes that President Vladimir Putin is ""panicking"" because of the failure of his military operation, adding the Russian leader is now seeking a negotiated settlement. The Guardian reports from Odesa on Ukraine's Black Sea coast, where preparations are under way to fight off any Russian assault.  It says nobody there can believe Mr Putin could attack a city with ""almost mythical resonance"" for many Russians, but adds the Russian armed forces have done lots of things in recent days that seemed unthinkable just two weeks ago.  A Ukrainian defence volunteer in Odesa has written to the i explaining people are ready not only to defend - but to attack. ""There is no fear at all"", Roman Vlasov tells the paper, ""just focus, and determination"". The Daily Mirror tells the story of a desperate Ukrainian builder who has been working in London and is now trying to get his family, who are stranded in Calais, to the UK.  The paper accuses the government of placing obstacles in the way of traumatised refugees.  The editor of the i, Oliver Duff, describes the UK's response to the crisis as increasingly shameful and in contrast with great public generosity.  The Daily Mail has a similar message in its editorial, arguing that nothing has been learned from the evacuation of Afghanistan last summer and urging the government to ""fix the visa shambles"". Sign up for a morning briefing direct to your inbox Meanwhile, many papers address the impact of the war for domestic energy prices in the UK.  The Financial Times describes ""an extraordinary day of trading volatility"", with a new spike in oil and gas prices.  The Daily Express says there is no alternative but to move towards renewables and calls higher bills in the meantime ""the price we must pay to defeat Putin"".  The Daily Mail says Boris Johnson signalled there would be more drilling in the North Sea, what it calls a new ""dash for gas"", and predicts a new generation of nuclear power.  The UK must ""seize this moment"" to start fracking, the Sun argues, adding it's ""shameful"" that it took a war to jump start a review of energy strategy."
Volatility,Coronavirus: Stocks bounce as volatility continues,2024-09-25,2020-03-17,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51921420,"Financial markets remain turbulent as a massive slowdown in economic activity due to the coronavirus takes hold across Europe and the US. In the US, shares rebounded about 6% after steep falls on Monday. London's FTSE 100 also jumped 2.7% after being down more than 1% earlier on Tuesday. Other major European markets made similar moves. It comes amid fresh promises of financial aid to helped bolster growth. In the US, President Donald Trump's administration said it was considering sending cheques to Americans as part of a $1tn stimulus package. The US Federal Reserve also said it would use emergency powers to purchase up to $1tn in short-term corporate debt directly from companies, reinstating a funding facility that was created during the 2008 financial crisis.  The Dow ended 5.2% higher, while the S&P 500 gained 6% and the Nasdaq rose 6.23%.  Meanwhile, in the UK, Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced £330bn in financial help for UK firms affected by the outbreak. The outgoing head of the Office For Budget Responsibility, Robert Chote, has said a temporary spike in borrowing would be sensible. Speaking to the Treasury Select Committee he said it was better to spend a ""little too much"" than too little, adding: ""When the fire is large enough, you just spray water"" (and worry about the clean up after). On Monday, French President Emmanuel Macron said his government would guarantee €300bn of loans, and pledged that no French company would be allowed to collapse. Italy, Germany, Japan and Spain have also all announced hundreds of billions of dollars in government relief. The scale of the US response - from both the central bank and the government - has been the most aggressive, even if many details remain unknown, said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS Markit. ""The good news is they're talking about it now, which is more than I can say about the Japanese or the Europeans,"" he said. ""It's too late to do anything to stop the recession. All you can do is limit the pain, limit the damage,"" he added. Earlier on Tuesday, Asian shares continued to see volatile trading on with markets in Tokyo, Hong Kong and Shanghai swinging between losses and gains.  The turbulence follows one of the worst days in history for US markets. The Dow Jones lost close to 13% and the S&P 500 fell almost 12%, marking the biggest one-day falls for both indexes since ""Black Monday"" in 1987. That followed the US Federal Reserve making another emergency rate cut on Sunday, prompting central banks around the world to ease policy in the biggest co-ordinated response since the global financial crisis more than a decade ago. In the last month, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has racked up the five biggest one-day points falls in its 135-year history. In March alone the index has also seen its four biggest one-day points gains on record. Wall Street's so-called ""Fear Gauge"" has just topped the levels seen during the financial crisis more than a decade ago. The Chicago Board Options Exchange's VIX, a measure of stock market volatility, surged by almost 43%, surpassing the level seen in 2008."
Volatility,Oil firm uses Ukraine to support UK drill plans,2024-09-25,2022-03-15,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-lincolnshire-60696458,"An oil company has been accused of ""seizing"" on the war in Ukraine as an opportunity to push on with plans for exploratory drilling in Lincolnshire. Egdon Resource said extending permissions near North Kelsey could provide valuable UK-based oil reserves. Residents against the proposals said ""horrors"" in Ukraine had been ""seized upon by Egdon to justify this project"". The company's application to allow more time for oil exploration at the site was refused by the council.  Egdon, which has had permission to explore in the area since 2014, was seeking the right to continue for another 12 months. But campaigners argued the amount of oil from the land would be ""trivial"" and said the site was home to rare wildlife species, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.  Egdon managing director Mark Abbot told Lincolnshire County Council's planning and regulation committee that Russia's invasion of Ukraine had brought into focus significant rises in oil prices and volatility in pricing. ""It's essential that there is sufficient supply of minerals to provide the infrastructure and buildings energy and goods that the country needs,"" he said.  ""Great weight should be given to these benefits… It's clear that there remains a national need for onshore oil and gas as part of the diverse and secure energy supply."" He blamed Covid for delaying work and said it impacted on plant operations in North Kelsey. He said re-evaluations carried out in that time had identified a better location 70-100 metres north which had the potential for greater amounts of oil. However, Amanda Suddaby, representing residents, told the meeting they had endured years of anxiety over the plans.  She said figures showed the plans ""might produce 50 to 200 barrels a day"" and argued 15 years' output would ""produce enough oil to supply the UK for just a few hours, not even a day"". Backing campaigners, Louth Wolds ward councillor Hugo Marfleet, said: ""This is not going to influence and be a game changer for anything about oil supply.  ""If they want proper oil go to the North Sea, but this is a little pond that's actually has no water left in it."" Rejecting the plans, councillors said they were unconvinced by the company's arguments with councillor Thomas Smith saying that using the Ukraine conflict as justification was ""disingenuous"".

Volatility,"Clock ticking on UK food-security action, NFU warns",2024-09-25,2023-02-21,By Claire Marshall and Malcolm Prior,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-64710377,"The ""clock is ticking"" for the government to protect homegrown food supply, the National Farmers' Union president has warned. Minette Batters said farmers were still being hit by labour shortages, high costs, the impacts of climate change and global political turmoil. Her warning came at the first day of the NFU's annual conference. The government said it would spend more than £168m of public money on supporting farm productivity. Mrs Batters said agricultural costs had risen by almost 50% since 2019 and the poultry industry - severely affected by the largest recorded outbreak of bird flu - had seen UK egg production fall to its lowest level in nine years. The country must ""never take our food security for granted,"" she said. ""There are three cornerstones on which a prosperous farming sector must be built and which any government should use to underpin its farming policy,"" Mrs Batters said. ""They are boosting productivity, protecting the environment and managing volatility.  ""But the clock is ticking. And it's ticking for government - to start putting meaningful, tangible and effective meat on the bones of the commitments it has made."" The NFU has previously warned many farms have cut production to limit losses from high inflation and energy bills, which could threaten domestic food security and supply. NFU Cymru deputy president Abi Reader told BBC News shoppers could be seeing less choice when it came to British food on the supermarket shelves. ""There are empty sheds out there that should be growing fruit and veg,"" she said. ""There are empty sheds that should have poultry in them to produce eggs - and this food just isn't coming through the system. ""We have got massive rising costs. A lot of this is due to the war in Ukraine, some of it is that we are still trying to settle down after Brexit - but these rising input costs are so high farmers just can't afford them.  ""Banks are worried about lending, so people have just contracted - businesses are producing less than they used to do."" Prime Minister Rishi Sunak addressed Tuesday's conference in Birmingham on 'Feeding a changing world', in a pre-recorded message. Farming minister Mark Spencer told delegates more than £168m in grants would be available for the development of new technology, as well as improved food production and animal welfare, in the year ahead. They will sit alongside the government's Environmental Land Management Scheme (ELMS) payments, as part of a total annual package of £2.4bn in public funding for farming. He said: ""We know that sustainable food production depends on a healthy environment, the two go hand in hand.   ""Helping farms invest in new technology as well as bringing in nature-friendly schemes will support the future of farming.""   ELMS is a post-Brexit farm payment scheme designed to reward landowners and farmers in England for environmental work. It is designed to replace the European Union's common agricultural policy subsidies. Mr Spencer also told delegates that foreign seasonal farm workers would be paid a minimum of the national living wage in the year ahead - set to be £10.42 from 1 April - and guaranteed a minimum of 32 hours of work every week. He said: ""That's the decent thing to do - and I think it is vital that we all stick to it."" Mrs Batters welcomed the announcement, saying it gave farmers ""clarity"". Meanwhile, she said that ""the rural vote will be crucial in the next election"" and she would not ""let the opposition off the hook"". Speaking at the conference, Sir Keir Starmer promised that Labour would overhaul the government's procurement policy so that 50% of all food purchased by the public sector would be locally produced and sustainable - a policy, he said, that would be worth £1.2bn of public money a year. ""And 50% is just the minimum,"" he said. ""We will do everything to go beyond it. We will buy more cereals, more oilseed rape, more strawberries, more beef and more British apples, and we will open up new opportunities to export them as well."" He also promised a better trading relationship for farmers with the EU. The government said its trade deals would see UK farmers and food producers benefit from new opportunities to sell abroad, while animal welfare and food-safety standards would be maintained."
Volatility,Bank's £65bn move driven by pension fund panic,2024-09-25,2022-09-28,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63065415,"The Bank of England stepped in to calm markets after some types of pension funds were at risk of collapse. It pledged to buy £65bn of government bonds after Friday's mini-budget sparked turmoil on financial markets and the pound plunged. Investors had demanded a much higher return for investing in government bonds, causing some to halve in value. Pension funds, which invest in bonds, were forced to start selling, sparking fears of a fresh market downturn. The Bank said its decision to buy government bonds at an ""urgent pace"" was driven by concern over ""a material risk to UK financial stability."" The government borrows money to fund its spending plans by selling bonds, or ""gilts"", to investors such as pension funds and big banks on international markets. But a collapse in the price of those bonds was forcing some pension funds to sell gilts and assets, further forcing down the price. If that process had continued, there was a risk that those pension funds could have got to a position where they couldn't pay their debts. To stop this from happening the Bank said it would buy around £65bn of gilts on Wednesday. Joe Dabrowski, deputy director of industry group the Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association, said: ""While this is a complex situation as there has been a lot of volatility in the gilt markets in recent days, we would not expect any significant issues for savers."" This is an immense show of force from the Bank of England trying to calm borrowing markets. It is already having an impact. It also raises some questions. First and foremost it underlines that this is a crisis, with the Bank responding in emergency mode. The clear cause was the chancellor's mini-budget, leading to a loss of market confidence, and spiralling borrowing rates on government debt. That crash in the value of loans to the government threatened to become a ""material risk to financial stability"", says the Bank. Read more here. The Pensions Regulator said it is monitoring financial markets closely for their impact on the funding of defined benefit, or final salary pension schemes, a spokesperson said. ""We welcome steps announced by the Bank of England to restore orderly conditions through temporary purchases of long-dated UK government bonds,"" the spokesperson added. The pound hit a record low on Monday following the chancellor's mini-budget, which pledged £45bn of tax cuts as part of a plan to boost economic growth.  The level of government borrowing required had shocked investors who questioned the sustainability of the public finances. UK government bond markets and stock markets, which had seen sharp falls, stabilised after the Bank's announcement and the pound also rose slightly. The government has insisted it is standing by its plan despite growing criticism. Treasury minister Andrew Griffith said on Wednesday that its tax cuts were the ""right plans"" to grow the UK economy. He said the Bank of England had ""done their job"" by announcing it would buy government debt to stabilise the economy. It came after the International Monetary Fund openly criticised the government's tax cut plans, warning that the measures were likely to fuel the cost-of-living crisis and increase inequality. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused the government of ""losing control of the economy,""  ""What the government needs to do now is recall Parliament and abandon this budget before any more damage is done,"" he said. While the government says it will not reverse its tax cuts, it has promised to release further plans to boost growth and reduce public debt on 23 November. In a statement, the Treasury said it would continue to work closely with the Bank ""in support of its financial stability and inflation objectives."" Former IMF deputy director Mohamed El-Erian told the BBC's Newsnight that UK policy had been ""incredibly incoherent"", with the government and the Bank of England working at cross-purposes. Meanwhile, chief secretary to the Treasury Chris Philp confirmed on Wednesday that government departments are being asked to find spending cuts. Speaking on ITV's Peston, Mr Philp said government departments are being asked to ""look for efficiencies wherever they can find them"". The efficiencies will ""stick to the targets"" of the 2021 Comprehensive Spending Review, Mr Philp said. Any savings will ""enable us to target spending on things that target growth,"" he said. Ministers have not decided whether benefits will rise in line with inflation in the autumn, he added. Mr Philp rejected calls for the OBR report on the mini-budget to be published, saying projections will be held until the 23 November to ensure they are done ""in a way that's organised and thoughtful""."
Volatility,Crypto adverts on London Tube under investigation,2024-09-25,2021-11-18,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-59309304,"Adverts placed on public transport in London for the Floki Inu cryptocurrency are being investigated by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA). The adverts for Floki Inu, named after Tesla boss Elon Musk's dog, appeared on underground trains and buses. The ASA, the UK's advertising watchdog, says it is ""reviewing a broad body of ads in this sector"" and assessing if they break the rules. Floki Inu said the adverts were ""legally cleared"".  ""These ads also include a clear disclaimer highlighting the volatility of cryptocurrencies,"" the firm told the BBC. The Floki Inu adverts, which appeared across the capital, sought to entice investors with the slogan ""Missed Doge? Get Floki"", following the growth of the Dogecoin cryptocurrency. Dogecoin started as a satirical joke based on the Shiba Inu dog from the Doge meme, but now has a theoretical total value measured in billions of dollars. Part of the concern about Floki Inu was that little was known about who was behind the project, and there are limited details on its website. Floki Inu told the BBC in an email: ""Our decision not to prominently feature team members on our website is intentional: to make it clear that Floki is the people's cryptocurrency and a movement focused on them."" It said its ""legal entity"" was based in Georgia, and it had shared this fact with ""strategic partners"" during know-your-customer checks. The email said the project's lead developer was Netherlands-based Jackie Xu, adding: ""The Floki team isn't entirely anonymous as is being purported, but some of our team members chose to be anonymous temporarily because they do not want the distractions, and for security reasons."" The adverts for Floki Inu are controversial.  Although the text said that the value of investments could fall, and that cryptocurrencies were unregulated in the UK, some politicians felt that the capital's transport operator, Transport for London (TfL), should not have accepted them. Green Party London Assembly member Sian Berry told the Guardian: ""This should have raised a red flag, and someone at TfL should have looked at this before it was approved."" The Mayor of London's office said, ""TfL is writing to the ASA and Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to ask for their views on the concerns being raised."" But in its email to the BBC, Floki Inu hit back, saying: ""The attack against these ads by a certain political party is an attack against cryptocurrency and against the people's freedom of choice - a clear attempt at censorship."" According to TfL, there have not been widespread complaints from the public about cryptocurrency adverts. It said it requires advertisers to mention that cryptocurrency is unregulated, and that its value may fall. ""We continue to work with the ASA and FCA to encourage better regulation of cryptocurrency, and will be discussing the concerns that have been raised with them to get their input as we consider what action might be necessary,"" TfL added. It said since 2018 it had required all cryptocurrency adverts to be referred to it for review ""prior to running on our estate"". Over the summer, the ASA banned an advert for the cryptocurrency exchange Luno, which ran on TfL, that had claimed ""it's time to buy"" Bitcoin. In a statement to the BBC, the ASA said it was looking at different cryptocurrency adverts, including those for Floki Inu, across ""various media spaces"" not just TfL.  ""We'll be assessing whether these ads break our rules and using our findings to inform our regulation in this area, including any follow-up enforcement action,"" the authority said.  It said adverts must ""must avoid jargon that can't be easily understood by their audience or take advantage of their lack of experience, and must appropriately flag risk, noting that the value of investments is variable and go down as well as up"". It added that cryptocurrency was a ""red alert area"" for the organisation. Other regulators are also concerned about the way cryptocurrency is promoted.  In September, Financial Services Authority chairman Charles Randell criticised influencers, accusing them of fuelling the ""delusions of quick riches"".  "
Volatility,Bitcoin futures trading begins in Chicago,2024-09-25,2017-12-10,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42304657,"Bitcoin has begun trading on a major exchange for the first time.  The digital currency launched on the CBOE futures exchange in Chicago at 23:00 GMT Sunday, allowing investors to bet on whether Bitcoin prices will rise or fall.  Its value had surged in the run-up to its futures debut, which saw it rise another 17% to above $18,000. Bitcoin's introduction to the CBOE has been seen by some as a step towards legitimising the currency. The move is expected to be followed next week by a listing on the rival Chicago Mercantile Exchange. CBOE trading saw the Bitcoin futures contract expiring in January start at $15,000 before rising to above $18,000. The contract is based on the price of Bitcoin as quoted on the Gemini exchange. The Gemini exchange was set up by the Winklevoss twins, who were early fans of the crypto-currency and who have been called the first Bitcoin billionaires. A CBOE insider said its start was low key, with ""no champagne"". However, CBOE tweeted to warn that its website was running slowly and could be temporarily unavailable. Anticipation of the first mainstream listings have helped the controversial currency soar past $10,000 and then over $17,000 on Thursday before retreating. The price of Bitcoin stood at about $16,600 on Monday, according to Coindesk.com. Futures are contracts that allow investors to bet on the price of something at a future date.  Investors can now bet on Bitcoin rising or falling in price without actually owning them. Futures are typically based on the price of a real commodity - such as oil. One of the controversial aspects of Bitcoin is that some do not see it as a ""thing"". Although it is called a currency, it can be argued it is an asset, or commodity, without any actual use or real assessable value.  Nick Colas, of Data Trek research, said the futures listings gave Bitcoin ""legitimacy - it recognises that it's an asset you can trade"". Chris Ralph, chief investment officer at St James's Place told the BBC's Today programme that he remained cautious about the currency. ""I refuse to use the word legitimate, but it's probably moved out of the shadows into the open,"" he said. ""But what I think it means is more people in the conventional investment banking market will take a look at Bitcoin. ""It has been described as the asset class of 2017 but when we went into the year no one would have called it an asset class."" Bitcoin futures will make it easier for more investors to buy the crypto-currency, by removing the need for them to set up a special digital Bitcoin wallet. Sceptics argue that the CBOE futures will simply draw more naïve investors into perpetuating a bubble in a financial asset that Nobel economist Joseph Stiglitz has accused of having no intrinsic value beyond supporting money laundering and tax avoidance. And there is something else that anyone placing big bets on the futures market may want to think about. The eventual payout on their futures contract depends on the auction price at the separate Gemini exchange of the Winklevoss brothers. Are they confident that the auction price cannot be manipulated, in the same way that Libor and regular currency derivatives have been in the recent past? The CBOE and CME launches were made possible following approval by the US Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). However, the regulator has warned investors about the ""potentially high level of volatility and risk in trading these contracts"".  The Futures Industry Association, which includes some of the world's biggest derivatives brokerages, has criticised the CFTC's decision, arguing that insufficient attention has been paid to the risks involved. Bitcoin is not regulated by any country's central bank and has no universally recognised exchange rate. CBOE rules suspend trading if Bitcoin prices rise or fall by 10%, in an attempt to reduce wild fluctuations. They kicked in twice in this first session. ""We are committed to continue to work closely with the CFTC to monitor trading and foster the growth of a transparent, liquid and fair Bitcoin futures market,"" CBOE said."
Volatility,A6 Londonderry-Dungiven road to open on Thursday,2024-09-25,2023-04-03,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-65170231,"The new A6 between Londonderry and Dungiven will open later this week, the Department for Infrastructure (DfI) has said. Work on the road started in 2018 and was due to be completed last autumn but has been beset by delays. On Monday DfI confirmed the 16-mile (25.5km) stretch will open on Thursday, ahead of the Easter holiday. ""This is great news for the 15,000 vehicles using the route each day,"" a DfI spokeswoman said. The opening of the Derry to Dungiven upgrade - part of the A6 road that links Derry and Belfast -  will ""bring long-term benefits for road users and the local community in providing shorter, safer and more reliable journey times,"" she added. Starting at the village of Drumahoe, the 16-mile section of dual carriageway will include a bypass around Dungiven. It was due to open last autumn and there has been frustration over delays. The road opened with speed limits and lane restrictions for a short period in summer 2022, but then later closed again as work continued. The DfI spokeswoman added: ""The Road Safety Audit process has been completed and the contractor will commence the process of removing cones and temporary traffic management arrangements on the morning of Thursday 6 April. ""The entire 25.5 kilometres of the road will be open for road users by Thursday afternoon with national speed limit in place"".     She said the opening of the road means the department has invested around £440m in the Derry to Belfast road upgrade. Sinn Féin MLA Caoimhe Archibald said the opening is ""positive news for Derry, Dungiven and the surrounding areas"". ""Not only will this new road cut journey times between Belfast and Derry, it will improve the north west's connection to other parts of the island,"" she said."
Volatility,Greens target fundamental reform of energy system,2024-09-25,2022-03-12,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-60720409,"The Scottish Greens have targeted a ""fundamental"" reform of the country's energy system to ease fuel poverty and reliance on fossil fuels. Co-leader Patrick Harvie told the Green conference in Stirling that funding would be targeted at insulating homes and people struggling with their bills. The party has now been in partnership government with the SNP for six months. Mr Harvie said the war in Ukraine and sanctions on Russia underlined the need to reduce reliance on oil and gas. Co-leader Lorna Slater said there was ""far more to come"" from the Greens in government, with policies aimed at boosting wind farm capacity and recycling. Both leaders also focused their speeches on the war in Ukraine, with Mr Harvie saying it was vital that words of solidarity translated into real action. And Ms Slater called for barriers to refugees entering the UK to be dropped, saying: ""Let them in. No excuses, no obstacles, no delays. Let them in now."" The UK government is due to set out details of a scheme which will allow people to welcome Ukrainians fleeing the conflict into their homes next week. The two leaders are both ministers in Nicola Sturgeon's government, courtesy of the co-operation agreement the Greens and SNP signed six months ago. They set out policies they aim to bring to fruition in the coming months and years, with Mr Harvie saying his party's policies could help ""make us safer from environmental collapse, from geopolitical threats, and from the volatility of energy costs"". He said Scotland must be insulated against the cold, but also against ""the blight of fuel poverty and against reliance on turbulent fossil fuel markets which bloat brutal regimes and destroy our planet"". Mr Harvie highlighted funding for fuel poverty schemes and efforts to improve energy efficiency, but also called for longer-term changes. He said: ""Our energy system needs to be transformed. The real answer to fuel poverty and energy insecurity lies in more fundamental reform - how energy is provided and how our homes, workplaces and community buildings are heated and powered."" Meanwhile, Ms Slater has announced that the government will bring forward a Circular Economy Bill which would ban shops from destroying unsold goods. She said: ""That isn't something that we could have done from the backbenches. It is the difference between opposition and government.  ""It is the difference between calling for something to be done and being able to directly deliver it."" The Greens have entered government at a strange and turbulent time in the world. This hybrid conference was partly hosted online, in a nod to the ""new normal"" way of life in the age of Covid-19. And the speeches opened and closed with talk of the war in Ukraine, with calls for more to be done to help refugees. But being in power means the party feels it can take a hand in helping to shape events, and the actions which much follow words of solidarity. This is particularly the case in terms of domestic policy. Now, when Patrick Harvie talks about energy efficiency and insulation, he can announce funding which makes a difference to people's lives. When Lorna Slater talks about recycling and the circular economy, she can bring forward legislation to make it a reality. The Greens will hope their position in government means they can build a record of delivery - which could in turn help them win votes and a shot at more power in future."
Volatility,Are sanctions hitting Iran’s access to medicine?,2024-09-25,2019-08-07,By Anahita Shams & Reality Check team,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-49051782,"Iran says sanctions are preventing lifesaving drugs from reaching the country, despite special exemptions for medical supplies.  This is disputed by Washington.   ""The United States exempts medicine and medical devices for the Iranian people from US sanctions,"" says Brian Hook, the American special representative for Iran.  So how are sanctions affecting access to medicines in Iran? Iran produces most of its own basic pharmaceuticals - but when it comes to the most advanced medicines, it relies heavily on imports.  It's estimated that although only about 4% of its medicines come from abroad in terms of volume, the more expensive imported drugs make up about a third of the total value.  There is only limited data on drug imports and prices paid inside Iran but anecdotal evidence can give some idea of the situation. The BBC's Persian Service has heard from its audience about rising costs of medicines.  A sufferer of Crohn's disease described the difficulties of accessing vital drugs. ""I have to travel to other towns and cities to check if their pharmacies have the drugs,"" they said. ""Some of them do but the prices are so high that I cannot afford them."" The BBC also spoke to a pharmaceutical importer from inside Iran who said the past two years had brought shortages and price rises. Drugs for anaesthetics, cancer-treatment and diabetes were particularly hard to find, they said. In the past 12 months, the cost of health and medical services rose by 19%, according to official Iranian statistics. But these shortages and price increases could be for many reasons, not only as a consequence of sanctions against Iran. International sanctions were lifted in 2016 following an agreement with Iran over its nuclear programme, but in November 2018 the United States reinstated ""the toughest ever"" sanctions on Iranian industry and banks. It threatened heavy punishment and exclusion from the US financial system for foreign companies seeking to circumvent these restrictions.   However, exporters of humanitarian supplies such as medicines and medical devices - and the companies facilitating this trade - should not be punished by the US for doing business with Tehran.  ""The problem is that you need to find banks willing to keep open the business lines and compliance functions to process those transactions,"" says Richard Nephew, an expert on US sanctions.  ""Often, they're seen as not worth the headache... so there is a practical problem in getting banks to do it.  But can they?  Sure.""  Also, not all medicines or medical devices qualify for the exemption.    ""Trading humanitarian goods and processing payments with Iran remains complex,"" says Justine Walker, director of sanctions policy at UK Finance, which represents British banks.  ""Legally, medicines are not prohibited under sanctions. However, they do become prohibited if they are found to be going to a designated actor or entity."" These include Iran's major banks.  Official Iranian figures seen by BBC News show a snapshot of the past 16 months of overall Iranian imports of medical drugs and devices.  These imports reached a peak of $176m (£145m) in September 2018, then fell significantly.   By June 2019, imports of medical supplies had fallen by 60% to about $67m. This fall coincides with the imposition of US sanctions but the data is limited and it's not possible to say with any certainty that sanctions are responsible. There is also data available from the EU, a key trading partner with Iran. Since sanctions were imposed in November last year, medical and pharmaceutical sales to Iran fell at first before rising slightly in May.  This followed a period when trade in medical supplies fluctuated, reaching a peak in 2016 (when international sanctions were lifted) and then falling in the following two years. Navigating new regulations and incurring extra costs, for example by changing banks, makes trade with Iran ""daunting for smaller firms"", says Esfandyar Batmanghelidj, founder of Bourse & Bazaar, which tracks Iran's economy. The lack of foreign currency inside Iran and the volatility of the Iranian currency also make imports more expensive.  Iran has been calling for the urgent implementation of a proposed European plan to support companies wishing to bypass US financial restrictions. But this has proven complex and politically difficult to implement.   Read more from Reality Check Send us your questions Follow us on Twitter"
Volatility,Trade dispute 'could hurt' Scotch industry,2024-09-25,2019-07-25,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-49110939,"A senior executive at spirits giant Diageo has expressed concern over the impact a trade dispute between the US and Europe could have on Scotland's whisky industry. This month, the US threatened to impose tariffs on a range of European Union imports, including Scotch whisky. Diageo Europe president John Kennedy said his company would be ""ready to handle whatever comes"". But he added he was concerned about the impact on Scotch whisky's supply chain. Mr Kennedy's comments came as Diageo announced a 9% rise in operating profit, to £4bn, for the year to 30 June. He told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: ""We are not immune from a trade war or the impact of tariffs in the short term, but we are used to dealing with volatility in global trade and we are resilient as we operate across over 180 countries at almost every price point with all of our brands, so we feel like we're fit and agile and will be ready to handle whatever comes.  ""What I would say though is, we are concerned about the potential impact of tariffs on Scotch whisky and the industry in Scotland, not just for us.  ""We are a big company, we can handle many changes. However, there is a big supply chain of smaller enterprises across Scotland that participate in Scotch whisky that would be negatively affected, so we are hoping that both sides participate in getting to a resolution."" The US has threatened to impose tariffs on European Union imports worth up to $4bn (£3.2bn), although it is not known when tariffs would be imposed. Meanwhile, Mr Kennedy said he was hopeful a pay row with Scottish employees will be resolved. The Unite and GMB unions are set to ballot workers at Diageo sites across Scotland over strike action after pay talks at arbitration service Acas broke down. On Wednesday, GMB Scotland said Diageo's latest offer of a 2.8% pay rise fell short of its members' aspirations. The union, which has nearly 1,000 members across Diageo's Scottish operations, said its ballot would run from 29 July to 16 August. It added that any action would disrupt production of brands such as Johnnie Walker, Gordon's and Smirnoff. Mr Kennedy said: ""We did improve our offer. That wasn't accepted but we remain open and expect to continue talks to get to an acceptable resolution. ""We feel good about how we operate as an employer in Scotland. We pay in the upper quartile versus other manufacturers in the country and have a wide range of strong benefits, so we expect those conversations to continue and hope to get to a resolution."" On Thursday, Diageo reported that sales for the year rose by 5.8% to £12.8bn on the back of growth ""across regions and categories"". Diageo said sales remained strong in Europe, pushed higher by a particularly strong performance in the UK and Ireland. The company's chief finance officer, Kathryn Mikells, said that the ""gin phenomenon"" has continued to drive sales globally, but particularly in continental Europe and the UK. Brands Tanqueray and Gordon's both reported double-digit growth in Europe as they were boosted by new product releases, such as Gordon's pink gin. Diageo also hailed strong growth for Johnnie Walker, which saw sales rise by 7%, although in Europe Scotch sales were largely flat as this was offset by weaker sales of J&B."
Volatility,Trade row 'could affect thousands of whisky jobs',2024-09-25,2020-01-30,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-51309632,"Spirits giant Diageo has warned that thousands of Scotch whisky jobs could be affected by the ongoing US-EU trade dispute. Diageo's global supply chain boss Ewan Andrew said tariffs had left smaller distilleries vulnerable, as well as supply chain operators such as farms. The US imposed a 25% tariff on imports of single malt Scotch in October. It was among measures introduced by the US in retaliation against EU subsidies given to aircraft maker Airbus. According to industry figures, more than 10,000 people are directly employed in the Scotch whisky sector in Scotland. A further 40,000 jobs across the UK are supported by the industry - 7,000 of which are in rural areas of Scotland. Mr Andrew told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: ""The important thing as we look forward is that we de-escalate on both sides and that products such as consumer goods are not tied in to something that is about the aerospace industry. ""My concern would be for the broader industry and for those smaller players in the industry. ""Right now I am sure it has had an impact on some of their businesses but if it were to escalate, that really would be difficult for Scotland.  ""So what's good for Scotch is good for Scotland, and that's why we would encourage a de-escalation so that it doesn't impact thousands of jobs right out into farming and rural communities."" Mr Andrew's comments come after representatives of the UK and US whisky industries called for the end of ""punitive tariffs that are wiping millions off export values every month"". The chief executives of the Scotch Whisky Association and the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States urged the UK and US governments to ""urgently find a negotiated solution to unrelated trade disputes and to remove all tariffs on distilled spirits"". In a separate development, Diageo has reported a rise in half-year profits, boosted by a strong performance in China. However, it expects sales to grow more slowly because of ""uncertainty in the global trade environment"". The company - whose brands include Smirnoff, Guinness, Johnnie Walker, Tanqueray and Gordon's gin - reported that in the six months to 31 December, operating profit increased 0.5% to £2.44bn. In Greater China, which includes Taiwan, net sales increased 24%, with double-digit growth in both Chinese white spirits and Scotch. Chief executive Ivan Menezes described the interim figures as ""another good, consistent set of results"", but warned that they had been delivered ""in the face of increased levels of volatility in India, Latin America and Caribbean and travel retail""."
Volatility,Gers - beyond the indy debate,2024-09-25,2023-08-17,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-66532162,"Why does the Scottish government publish the Government Expenditure and Revenue Scotland (Gers) report?  Some supporters of independence see it as a form of masochism, and wish ministers could devise a way of publishing figures alongside it that make the prospects of independent control of the public finances a bit more appealing.  We've had such a publication promised, but it's difficult, both politically and in economic forecasting terms. Everything in it would rely on numerous policy choices for a future Scottish government.  Every such choice would be open to hostile scrutiny, and criticism from other supporters of independence who might wish a different choice. The official answer to the question 'why publish it?' is that it is intended to help public understanding of Scotland's public finances. And at a time when the prospects of a referendum seem somewhat more distant, there are some elements of it that shed a non-constitutional light on taxation and spending. So what can we learn? One lesson is that pandemics and energy crises mess with public finances. Every country faced much higher health and economic support spending through two years of Covid. The Gers publication two years ago showed a notional deficit at twice the size revealed today - £38bn, or 23% of total output from the economy, while the UK as a whole hit 15%. Last year, covering 2021-22, the Scottish notional deficit fell to £25bn, and nearly 13% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Tax and spending is a lot closer to being in balance in the most recent figures with that Covid cost all but stripped out. However the most recent year, 2022-23, feels the impact of the surge in energy prices.  That meant a lot was spent, most of it by the UK government, supporting households and businesses through much higher bills. Scotland takes its share of that. Those higher bills fuelled price inflation, which in turn provoked the Bank of England into trying to dampen inflation with higher interest rates. The costs of servicing Scotland's share of that debt also weighs on the Scotland-only figures. More on that later. On the other hand, the energy price hike that followed on Russia's invasion of Ukraine was good for producers of oil and gas. Their profits soared, the tax take soared proportionately, and then two tranches of windfall tax were applied, raising nearly £5bn on top. Gers gives Scotland a geographic share of 89% of revenue from oil and gas production in UK waters.  So tax from that source soared from £750m two years ago, to £2.4bn last year, to £9.4bn in the most recent figures.  It is the most volatile part of UK taxation, and its volatility makes even more of a difference to the reckoning for Scotland. Another lesson is how Scotland's tax base is estimated to vary from that of the UK as a whole. It has long been the case that Scotland pays more than its population share for the vice taxes: alcohol, tobacco and gambling. That also goes for environmental levies and business rates, as an indication Scottish business groups will cite as a signal of the Scottish government being somewhat less helpful or more hostile to them than firms south of the border. The categories where Scots pay tax at less than their population share should be no surprise; capital gains tax at less than half the population share, and similarly low levels for inheritance tax. There is, unsurprisingly, less wealth to be taxed than in England, or to be more precise, the south-east of England. Income tax, while largely devolved to Holyrood, raises 24% of all the tax raised in Scotland and linked with that is National Insurance, which raises 20% of the total.  Income tax comes to only 6.7% of the UK total, despite higher rates on higher earners, while National Insurance, levied by the Treasury, is 7.5%, against a population share of 8.2%. That reflects lower average earnings. Rather than accept as much, it can be seen as a central challenge to the Scottish government's finances. If it is to raise income tax revenue to deliver the higher level of public services to which it aspires, it is not enough to raise tax rates: it also needs to strengthen the tax base. On the expenditure side, Gers highlights how much of total spend is on the state pension and reserved welfare payments, at more than quarter of the total. Health takes more than 16%. The health budget was cut after the two year surge in spending due to Covid, but it's still nearly a third up on 2019. One of the biggest claims on the public purse last year was £10.9bn, or nearly one tenth of expenditure, in Scotland's share of interest payments on public sector debt. It's more than twice the amount spent on transport or attributed to Scotland for defence. It's nearly three times the amount spent on public order and safety (police and justice). It's more than education and training.   As borrowing and interest rates have risen steeply, the cost of servicing debt has more than doubled in the past two years, from £4bn, eating a huge tranche of funds that could be spent elsewhere.  Borrowing to fund infrastructure and get the economy onto a faster growth path can be well worth it. It's a necessary part of government finance. But when interest rates rise and the bills come in, Gers is a reminder that we've reached the end of a historic era, lasting 14 years, of cheap finance."
Volatility,Extra £10m approved to cover health overspend,2024-09-25,2022-03-16,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-isle-of-man-60754884,"Additional funding of up to £10m to cover the cost of an overspend in health care on the Isle of Man has been approved by Tynwald. Health Minister Lawrie Hooper said it was due to rising drug prices, off-island treatment, and higher than planned pay awards. It is the seventh consecutive year that health services have been over budget. However, Mr Hooper said a new funding model for 2022-23 should bring that to an end. A £1m shortfall in a £2.7m savings target set for Manx Care, due to the impact of Covid on implementing savings measures, has also contributed to the overspend, he said. Mr Hooper told Tynwald the health care provider, which was formally established in April, was ""continuing to go through a period of challenge and change"" but was ""fully committed"" to balancing its books next year. A total of more than £21m in additional funding for health was set out in the treasury minister's latest budget, including £8.25m to be drawn down from the interest from the National Insurance Fund. About £6.6m of that is earmarked to be set aside as an internal contingency for the forthcoming year. Outlining the overspend, Mr Hooper said there had been a significant increase in spending on drugs, particularly those for cancer, due to the impact of Brexit and Covid on prices, leading to a rise of £2.6m above budget. The ""volatility"" of the cost of sending patients to UK hospitals for treatment was another factor, equating to £2.6m more than planned. Another significant contributor to the overspend was pay awards above the 1% budgeted for in the current year. Mr Hooper said the total impact would be an additional £3.7m, including a proposed 4% rise for some staff which is currently being disputed, which it was ""simply not possible to find"" in the existing budget.

Volatility,UK petrol price hits fresh record above £1.50,2024-09-25,2022-02-28,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60554128,"Fuel prices have hit record highs in the UK as Russia's invasion of Ukraine continues to affect global oil prices. The RAC said the average price of petrol jumped to £1.51 a litre on Sunday, while diesel increased to £1.55. The price of both fuels has jumped since Thursday, when Russia began its assault on Ukraine. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said despite oil prices calming, prices at the pump will continue to rise. The cost of filling a 55-litre family car with unleaded petrol is now £83, or £85 for diesel. ""This week will be an important one in terms of the oil price as it's likely to reveal the speed of the inevitable upward trend or the extent of the volatility in the market,"" said Mr Williams. The price of Brent crude rose by 4.6% to $102 barrel on Monday after Western nations imposed new sanctions on Russia - one the world's largest energy producers. Petrol price movements in the UK are mainly determined by the price of crude oil, and the exchange rate between the dollar and the pound, because fuel, like oil is traded in dollars. Although the UK imports just 6% of its crude oil from Russia, it would still be affected by global wholesale prices rising. UK consumers are already paying a high price for fuel, with demand surging following the easing of Covid restrictions. Steve Irwin, from fuel consultancy firm Portland, told the BBC that prices had risen due to concerns over oil and gas pipelines which travel through Ukraine and carry Russian products. He said there was ""potential for enormous supply disruption"" if Russia retaliated to sanctions and used oil ""as a weapon"". ""It's impossible to know what kind of trajectory we are looking at for oil prices over the coming weeks,"" he said. However, Mr Irwin added that price was a bigger concern than supply currently, as the US and Saudi Arabia are also huge oil exporters. Mandy Watts depends on her car for work, but thinks ""the cost of petrol has gone through the roof"". Going carless isn't an option for Mandy, but she is trying to use it less. ""Being a single parent as well, you have to think about these things,"" she told the BBC. ""Is it petrol, is it food, is it heating, what do you put first? Food and heating has to come before petrol. So I tend to limit a little bit where I go now."" Robert Halfon, a former Conservative minister, has called on Chancellor Rishi Sunak to look at reducing VAT or fuel duty, which has been frozen for 12 years. He told the Times: ""Given what is going on it is genuinely going to be unaffordable for most families. It isn't just for motorists, it's businesses too because they can't afford transportation costs and things like that."" Luke Bosdet, fuel spokesman for the AA, said the rise in fuel costs came at the same time as households were facing energy bill rises. ""To think that, less than two years ago, fuel at £1 a litre beckoned,"" he said.  ""If there is a silver lining, the predictions of 160p or even 170p-a-litre fuel now look exaggerated as the oil price fell back after one day's surge last week."""
Volatility,Where are Scotland's inequalities?,2024-09-25,2023-08-09,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-66449845,"You don't hear much about 'levelling up' within Scotland.  It's a Whitehall term, dating back a couple of prime ministers. A political project to close the gulf of opportunity between London and its prosperous south-east neighbours and the parts of the country which feel - in many cases rightly - that they have been left behind. Some of the funds reach Scotland with a union flag prominently attached but most of the political project is aimed at parts of the north of England. England is a large and populous country with a sprawling confusion of weak local governance and that makes the devolution of power and distribution of funds a big task. In Scotland, we haven't heard so much about devolving power out from Holyrood.  Perhaps it's because of the party in government. The clue is in the name. They are not just the Scottish party but the Scottish National Party.  Sixteen years ago, the party's approach to local government began with Alex Salmond triumphantly signing an 'historic concordat' of mutual respect with councils. This was intended to be a contrast with the Labour-Liberal Democrat coalition years, when Holyrood had difficult relations with local councils. The agreement also brought in the freeze on council tax rises. The SNP government then applied the harshest squeeze of the austerity years to local authority budgets. That came with a return to ring-fencing for Nicola Sturgeon's priorities such as childcare. Under Humza Yousaf, the relationship has returned to an agreement on councils being treated with more respect, with less ring-fencing of budgets, an ""expectation"" that services will be ""delivered at a local level unless agreed otherwise"", and periodic reviews of council powers. The role of Holyrood in funding councils is partly to equalise across them, securing an equivalent level of public service whatever the tax base.  Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire complain they have long come out of that badly.  It's one reason the city centre has not benefited from the same regeneration and modernisation funds as poorer council areas to the south. Hence, the disputed efforts to catch up in Union Terrace Gardens and Union Street. Now, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has provided evidence that the north east has a case for more help from St Andrew's House in Edinburgh.  The region's relatively high employment and high earnings, fuelled by oil and gas, have slowed closer to Scotland's average. Hourly pay was once 30% higher than the Scottish average but the last decade has seen that drop to a 14% premium. The Highlands and islands have many pockets of employment in offshore work but it has not been doing as well as those on the other side of the Spey. Average hourly pay, which was 6% below the national average, has fallen to leave a 10% shortfall. Dumfries and Galloway has not had the same energy boom as the north, nor the benefit of as much infrastructure spending. It ranks as the lowest-paid council area in Scotland. At £16.10 per hour, that's around £2 below average, and £10 below the highest paying area, East Renfrewshire. The IFS story is about Scotland playing catch-up with the rest of the UK. And if you exclude London as an outlier because it distorts such figures with super-high pay for financiers, lawyers and oligarchs, much of Scotland has in fact grown to match the UK over the earlier parts of the past two decades.  From 2002 until around 2014, Scotland was catching up at a healthy pace. That stalled around 2014, when the global oil price tanked and both jobs and pay in the offshore industry also took a dive.  They've only partially recovered in the past three years of spikes and volatility and remain constrained both by uncertainty about the UK tax regime and the political uncertainty as to whether a new burst of investment will be encouraged or discouraged by Downing Street after the next election. The IFS says all of the slowing up of Scotland's national earnings growth can be explained by the slowing up of the nation's north and north east. Its analysis has positive things to say about some of those parts of Scotland which have struggled out of de-industrialisation in recent decades.  West central Scotland has done a lot of catching up in employment and earnings. It's been clear since at least the start of the century, even as oil and gas production declined, that Scotland was no longer the poor relation of the United Kingdom but in many ways typical of its economic performance. The IFS analysis underlines that. The report also puts a spotlight on poverty and differences in income inequalities, which have been flagged up as a top priority for Humza Yousaf. Scotland has had lower measures of inequality than the rest of the UK - in other words, it's less unfair - but drawing on data from before the pandemic, it was moving closer to the UK position. The household close to the top of the Scottish earnings spectrum (technically, the 90th percentile) has recently had income 5.7 times more than the person equally close to the bottom. The comparable figure for the UK peaked above a seven-fold multiple of earnings, before falling slightly.  Taking those two people as examples is intended to strip out the distorting effect at both extremes. The most recent available figures show less of a gap in Scotland between middle and high earners than in other parts of Britain but a similar gap between middle earners and those on the lowest income. Scotland's level of poverty, at 19%, is reckoned to be around three percentage points lower than the average south of the border.  Much of this is explained by housing costs. Scotland has a significantly higher share of renting households in social housing than the rest of the UK (59% to 45%) and those in social rented housing are paying lower rents than those south of the Border. The report uses statistics from 2017 to 2019 to show the proportion of children in relative poverty at 24% compared with 30% in the rest of the UK.  It signals that future studies can expect to see an impact on the poverty figures from that £25 weekly Scottish Child Payment for those on lower income, which was increased and expanded less than a year ago.  But it warns the Scottish government of limits to its largesse with welfare benefits, and also limits to the returns on increased tax rates for higher earners. Scottish government has been focussed on that sort of inequality and less so on the geographical variety. But of course, politics comes back into this when elections loom. And politics is geographical.  While the SNP is fighting to retain seats across Scotland, the IFS highlights what it calls ""a conundrum"".  Scotland's levelling up challenge is whether to focus more attention on helping parts of Scotland that have slowed but remain relatively well off, or on those that have been catching up but remain worse off and which are still recovering from the decline of older industries.

Volatility,'Surprise' pick-up in UK house prices,2024-09-25,2021-03-02,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56250728,"House price growth rebounded last month with the average value hitting a record high of £231,068, according to the   Nationwide. Prices were up 6.9% from a year before, compared with 6.4% in January, it said. ""This increase is a surprise,"" said the Nationwide's Robert Gardner, as price growth had been expected to slow ahead of the end of the stamp duty holiday. The holiday is due to end on 31 March although there have been reports it could be extended. The stamp duty holiday means the tax has been suspended on the first £500,000 of all property sales in England and Northern Ireland since July.  There has also been some relief from the equivalent taxes for property buyers in Scotland and Wales - which is also set to end on 31 March. An announcement on any changes in stamp duty could come in this week's Budget.  A mortgage guarantee scheme to help people with small deposits buy a property ladder is set to be announced in the Budget. The government will offer incentives to lenders, bringing back 95% mortgages which have ""virtually disappeared"" during the pandemic, the Treasury says. The Nationwide said house prices rose by 0.7% month-on-month, after taking account of seasonal effects, reversing the 0.2% monthly decline recorded in January. However, it added that the outlook for the housing market was particularly uncertain right now, and the market could slow because of the employment situation. Many workers remain on furlough, and some of those jobs may not return. Rival lender the Halifax said last month that the economic realities of 2021 meant activity would slow as the year progressed. Mr Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist, said: ""It may be that the stamp duty holiday is still providing some forward momentum, especially given the paucity of properties on the market at present. ""Shifts in housing preferences may also be providing a more significant boost to demand, despite the uncertain economic outlook. ""Many peoples' housing needs have changed as a direct result of the pandemic, with many opting to move to less densely populated locations or property types, despite the sharp economic slowdown and the uncertain outlook."" Samuel Tombs, economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics consultancy, said he had been forecasting a fall in house prices this year, but the Nationwide numbers have prompted a rethink. ""Our forecast for house prices to drop by about 2% this year now looks too downbeat, though we'll wait for details of the guarantee scheme to be released before providing new numbers."" However, Anna Clare Harper, chief executive of asset manager SPI Capital, said: ""Reduced stamp duty is not the only driver of house price growth since the strictest lockdown conditions were removed in 2020.  ""We also have cheap debt as a result of very low interest rates, which gives buyers a 'discount'; the release of pent-up supply and demand and desire to improve surroundings amongst existing homeowners.  ""There is also the 'flight to safety', since in times of uncertainty, people want to put their money in a stable asset with low volatility. These trends are likely to hold up throughout 2021."""
Volatility,Why a problem of plenty is hurting India's farmers,2024-09-25,2017-06-07,By Soutik Biswas,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-40184788,"Farmers are on the boil again in India. In western Maharashtra state, they have been on strike for a week in some seven districts now, spilling milk on the streets, shutting down markets, protesting on the roads and attacking vegetable trucks. In neighbouring Madhya Pradesh, curfew has been imposed after five farmers were killed in clashes with police on Tuesday. Last month, farmers in southern Telangana and Andhra Pradesh staged protests and burnt their red chilli crop. The farmers are demanding waivers on farm loans and higher prices for their crops. For decades now, farming in India has been blighted by drought, small plot sizes, a depleting water table, declining productivity and lack of modernisation.  Half of its people work in farms, but farming contributes only 15% to India's GDP. Put simply, farms employ a lot of people but produce too little. Crop failures trigger farm suicides with alarming frequency. The present unrest is, however, rooted in a problem of plenty.  In Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, the farmers are on the streets because a bumper harvest fuelled by a robust monsoon has led to a crop glut. Prices of onions, grapes, soya-bean, fenugreek and red chilli, for example, have nosedived. In most places, the governments have been less than swift in paying the farmer more for the crops - the government sets prices for farming in India and procures crops from farmers to incentivise production and ensure income support. So why has a bumper crop led to a crisis in farming? Some believe that the price crash is the result of India's controversial withdrawal of high value banknotes  - popularly called demonetisation - late last year.  The ban, surprisingly, did not hurt planting as farmers ""begged and borrowed"" from their kin and social networks to pay for fertilisers, pesticides and labour, Harish Damodaran, rural affairs and agriculture editor at The Indian Express newspaper told me.  So more land was actually cropped, and bountiful rains led to a bumper crop. But traders, Mr Damodaran believes, possibly did not have enough cash to pick up the surplus crop.  ""Although the chronic cash shortage has passed, there is still a liquidity problem. I have been talking to traders who say there's not enough cash, which remains the main medium of credit in villages. I suspect the price crash has been caused by a lack of cash."" A prominent trader in Lasangaon, Asia's biggest onion market in Maharashtra, a state which accounts for a third of India's annual production, told me that concerns over shortage of cash leading to crop price crashes were ""exaggerated"".  ""There has been a good crop for sure, but a lot of traders have picked up crop, paying cash, issuing cheques and using net banking. Some of the glut and wastage has been due to the ongoing strike, when trucks of vegetables have been attacked on the highways,"" Manoj Kumar Jain said. Still others believe the main reason for the ongoing crises actually rooted in India's chronic failure of coping with surplus harvests because of lack of adequate food storage and processing capacity. ""If the rains are good, you end up with a glut of crops and prices crash. The glut only highlights the inefficiencies of the farming value chain and hits farmers,"" Ashok Gulati, an agriculture specialist at the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations, told me. Take onions, for example. The vegetable is 85% water and loses weight quickly.  In Lasangaon, traders buy the crop from farmers and store the onions on concrete in tarpaulin-covered sheds. If the weather stays right, 3-5% of the stored crop is wasted in storage. But if the mercury soars, more onions dry up, lose weight and 25-30% of the stored crop could be wasted.   In a modern cold storage, however, onions can be stored in wooden boxes at 4C. Crop wastage is less than 5%. Storage costs about a rupee (less than a US cent)  for every kilogram of onion a month.  So the government needs to make sure - or even subsidise - to keep the vegetable affordable to consumers once it reaches the retail market. ""We need to make the supply storage chain so efficient that the customer, farmer and the storage owner are happy. Unfortunately India hasn't been able to make that happen,"" Dr Gulati said. For one, India just doesn't have enough cold storages.  There are some 7,000 of them, mostly stocking potatoes in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh. Resultantly, fruits and vegetables perish very quickly. Unless India hoards food effectively, a bumper crop can easily spell doom for farmers. Secondly, there's not enough processing of food happening to ensure that crops don't perish or go waste.  Take onions, again.  One way to dampen volatility in onion prices is to dehydrate the bulb and make these processed onions more widely available. Currently, less than 5% of India's fruit and vegetables is processed. Thirdly, farmers in India plant for new harvest looking back at crop prices in the previous year. If the crop prices were healthy, they sow more of the same, hoping for still better prices.  If the rains are good, a crop glut can happen easily, and lead to extraordinary fall in prices. Farmers hold on to the crops for a while, and then begin distress sales. ""You need to allow future prices through contract farming, not cropping based on last year's prices,"" says Dr Gulati. Clearly, farming policies in India need a radical overhaul.  Punjab, India's ""granary"", is a perfect example.  At a time when India does not suffer food shortages, water-guzzling wheat and rice comprise 80% of its cropped area and deplete groundwater.   Rising production of cereals has meant that government has been giving paltry rises to the farmers while buying paddy and wheat, eroding their profitability. ""They [the policies] are distorting the choices that farmers make - those who should be finding ways to grow vegetables, which grow more expensive every year, are instead growing  wheat we no longer need,"" says Mihir Sharma, author of Restart: The Last Chance for the Indian Economy.  But the best that the governments here do is to quickly raise crop buying prices and alleviate the farmers' suffering.  Faced with a crop glut at home, the newly appointed BJP government in Uttar Pradesh was smart enough to promptly raise the procurement price of potatoes - and announce a controversial farm loan waiver - and quell a simmering farmers' revolt .  The government in Madhya Pradesh, ruled by the same party, failed to act in time. Now it says it will pay more to buy off the surplus onions. The more things change, the more they remain the same. "
Volatility,Crypto lender Genesis files for bankruptcy,2024-09-25,2023-01-20,By Shiona McCallum & Mike Farrell,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-64343377,"Cryptocurrency lender Genesis has filed for bankruptcy. The firm had recently been charged by US regulators Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) with illegally selling crypto. It is part of the Digital Currency Group (DCG), a conglomerate of more than 200 crypto-focused businesses. The insolvency of Genesis is linked to the bankruptcy of FTX, which went under last November amid allegations of fraud. Genesis had originally been set up as an ""over the counter"" Bitcoin trading desk, enabling the trade of large amounts of crypto. Earlier this month, it announced it was laying off 30% of its staff, taking it down to 145 employees. ""We look forward to advancing our dialogue with DCG and our creditors' advisers as we seek to implement a path to maximise value and provide the best opportunity for our business to emerge well-positioned for the future,"" Genesis interim chief executive Derar Islim said in a statement. Genesis had been hit by the collapse of another crypto firm, Three Arrows Capital, which went bankrupt in June last year. It said it was owed $1.2bn (£971m) by Three Arrows, which had been brought down by the collapse of cryptocurrencies Luna and TerraUSD in May. It is the latest in a series of shocks to the sector, which has been dubbed the ""crypto winter"" by some analysts, describing the plummet in value of cryptocurrencies. Genesis is also embroiled in a high-profile dispute with Gemini, owned by the former Olympic rowers Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, over the fate of $900m in assets that Gemini customers deposited with the lender. The product, called Gemini Earn, was sold to investors as a chance to earn as much as 7.4% interest on their cryptocurrency holdings. Some 340,000 Earn users have been unable to access their funds since November, when Genesis halted withdrawals because of the volatility in the crypto markets. Last week the SEC accused both Genesis and Gemini of illegally selling crypto assets to investors. The Winklevoss twins said they were looking forward to defending the action, but DCG has so far not commented. Cameron Winklevoss tweeted shortly after Genesis filed for bankruptcy.  The bankruptcy filing is another blow as the effects of FTX collapse are still being felt. Founder Sam Bankman-Fried is accused of fraud after diverting funds deposited by millions of customers on his FTX platform, and transferring them without authorisation to Alameda, a hedge fund. In December, the 30-year-old was extradited from the Bahamas, where FTX was based, back to the US where he formally pleaded not guilty to charges of defrauding customers and investors.  He was released on $250m bail, denying the allegations."
Volatility,GCSEs 'need boost to catch global rivals',2024-09-25,2017-08-23,By Sean Coughlan,https://www.bbc.com/news/education-41014624,"Pass marks for GCSEs in England need to be pushed upwards to catch up with high performing education systems in Asia, say researchers from the Education Policy Institute. GCSE results are being changed to grades 9 to 1, with the first such grades to be published this week. But there will be two different pass marks - grade 4 as a ""standard"" pass and grade 5 as a ""strong"" pass. Researchers say pupils need to be at grade 5 to match global rivals. The study from the Education Policy Institute says England's school system faces an ""immense challenge"" if it is going to match the levels of achievement in countries such as Singapore, South Korea, Hong Kong and Japan. GCSEs in England are being made more challenging and will be decided by final exams rather than coursework, with the first results of these new-style GCSEs being published for English and maths this week. These will be graded from 9 to 1, with a grade 4 being counted as a ""standard"" pass, similar to a grade C. But the researchers say that on average pupils should be achieving a ""strong"" pass at grade 5, if England is going to keep up with international competitors. At present, the researchers say, only 40% of pupils in state schools have reached this ""world-class standard"". To keep up in maths, the study says, it would require an increase of over a third of pupils getting top grades and an average above grade 5. ""The old C grade is not an adequate national aspiration if England wants to compete with top education nations,"" says David Laws, former Education Minister and executive chairman of the Education Policy Institute. ""This analysis highlights the gulf between education outcomes in England and the performance of the world's best education nations,"" he said.  ""In certain subjects, such as maths, England needs both to significantly raise the number of top performers and almost halve the number of low performers if it is to compete with the world's best."" Paul Whiteman, leader of the National Association of Head Teachers said: ""This report shows that England's obsession with structural change, under a succession of governments, has had little impact on either standards or equity.  ""Policy makers have routinely pursued the wrong priorities,"" said Mr Whiteman. ""The highest performing school systems are those that invest in their teachers and that respect and value education."" Kevin Courtney, leader of the National Union of Teachers, said that even if the overall results at national level were kept in line with previous years, individual schools ""will still experience volatility in their results"". He warned that such volatility could have ""unfair consequences"". There have been warnings about confusion over having two pass grades - with universities using different versions of a pass in their entry requirements. Education Secretary Justine Greening had explained the plans for two pass grades to the education select committee earlier this year. ""I want to provide certainty about how this new grading will work and, in particular, the consequences for individual pupils of achieving a grade 4 or grade 5,"" Ms Greening had written to the committee chairman.  ""Rather than reporting on the ""good pass"", we will instead distinguish between a grade 4 as a ""standard pass"" and a grade 5 as a ""strong pass"" and report on both."" A Department for Education spokesman said: ""We know there is more to do and this report underlines the importance of our reforms to create new gold-standard GCSEs, benchmarked against the best education systems in the world so young people learn the knowledge and skills that will allow them to compete in an increasingly global workplace."""
Volatility,Stock markets suffer worst quarter since 1987,2024-09-25,2020-03-31,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-52113841,"Stock markets around the world suffered historic losses in the first three months of the year amid a massive sell-off tied to the coronavirus. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and London's FTSE 100 saw their biggest quarterly drops since 1987, plunging 23% and 25% respectively. The S&P 500 lost 20% during the quarter, its worst since 2008. The drops come as authorities order a halt to most activity in an effort to slow the spread of the virus. Economists have warned the hit to the global economy is likely to be worse than the financial crisis, with forecasters for IHS Markit, for example, predicting growth will shrink 2.8% this year, compared to a 1.7% drop in 2009. No country has been left untouched. The data firm expects China's growth to sputter to 2%, while the UK could see growth drop 4.5%. The outlook for countries such as Italy and less developed economies is even worse. ""We remain very concerned about the negative outlook for global growth in 2020 and in particular about the strain a downturn would have on emerging markets and low income countries,"" the president of the International Monetary Fund, Kristalina Georgieva, said on Tuesday. In the US, one central bank analysis suggested the unemployment rate could rise to more than 32% over the next three months, as more than 47 million people lose their jobs. Globally, many indexes remain more than 20% lower than they were at the start of the year. A steep slide in oil prices, due to a drop in demand and a price war between producers, has compounded the problems on financial markets. Governments have pledged massive rescue funds, which has helped to lift share prices in recent days.  On Tuesday, the FTSE gained almost 2%, while Germany's Dax and France's CAC 40 saw more modest gains. But the main US indexes stumbled, with the Dow dropping 1.8%, the S&P 500 down 1.6%, and the Nasdaq off almost 1%. Energy and financial firms were among the worst performers in the quarter. Retailers, which have seen sales evaporate as stores closed, suffered some of the biggest losses on Tuesday, with Macy's down almost 9% a day after it said it would put the majority of its staff on unpaid leave. ""Despite monetary and financial stimulus, we expect volatility of equities to remain elevated as long as the duration and impact of Covid-19 remain unknown, oil prices stay depressed and earnings visibility is murky,"" analysts for US Bank Wealth Management wrote."
Volatility,Why did Man Utd not sign anyone?,2024-09-25,2018-08-09,Simon Stone,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/45133827,"This video can not be played I am going to enjoy this season - Mourinho Speaking to Manchester United's own TV station following a 1-0 defeat by Bayern Munich on 5 August, Jose Mourinho said his side would face ""a difficult season"" unless they signed at least one more player. At the time, United boss Mourinho was confident a new central defender would be recruited. It did not happen. Despite late excitement over a move for Uruguay's Diego Godin, which, it subsequently transpired, had fizzled out earlier in the week virtually as soon as it had been made, Mourinho's squad remains as it was on 4 July when Lee Grant arrived from Stoke as United's third-choice keeper. Thirty-six hours before the 2018-19 Premier League was set to begin - United welcome Leicester to Old Trafford on Friday night - Mourinho was asked if he had the ""tools to compete"" with Manchester City and Liverpool. ""I know the words you want me to say,"" he said. ""I think by the end of November, December you won't need words, you will see by then which teams are candidates to win the Premier League."" Does that mean there is trouble ahead for Manchester United? In short, they couldn't do the right deal. The confidence Mourinho expressed about United getting an additional signing on 31 July during the club's pre-season tour of the United States was based around multiple targets. They ranged from Leicester's Harry Maguire to Barcelona's Yerry Mina (who subsequently joined Everton), via seasoned internationals Jerome Boateng and - briefly - Godin. United have the money to do big deals. They were prepared to do exactly that to get a top player. Executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward would not have flinched had he been told £100m, a sum that would have smashed both United's club record transfer fee and the world record for a defender, was the price to be paid for for the right man. Why it is dangerous to write off Jose Mourinho - Shearer Mourinho warns of 'difficult season' But the right man never materialised. Over the course of a lengthy meeting between United and Real Madrid top brass in Miami last month, Raphael Varane never became a discussion topic because it was obvious the Champions League winners would not have sold him. Talks about Maguire never progressed beyond the outline stage because, with no need to sell and secure in the knowledge the England man had four years left on his contract, Leicester were pushing the price upwards, to the level Liverpool paid for Virgil van Dijk. For a man with no Champions League experience and still relatively new to the Premier League, United did not think entering the market at that level was wise. Raphael Varane played every minute of France's World Cup-winning campaign Godin's class is not in question either. The 32-year-old remains one of the best defenders in the world. Encouraged to go for the Uruguayan in the final days of the window, United discovered they were being used as leverage to net Godin a better contract extension from Atletico Madrid, so another door closed. Jerome Boateng was offered by Bayern Munich for about £40m. Mourinho was keen on the former Manchester City man. United, having analysed Boateng's awful appearance record - 33 games missed through injury and illness in two seasons - proposed a loan. Boateng and Bayern were not impressed. United were not impressed by the outcome of their negotiations over Mina, walking away from what they regarded as prohibitive agents' fees which, if they had agreed to them, would have set a dangerous precedent for a player who is hardly in the world-class bracket. Speculation surrounding a move for Tottenham's Toby Alderweireld rumbled on for much of the summer. It turned out to be unfounded. United never made a bid for the 29-year-old Belgian. As one club source said: ""We ended up in a situation where if we had done a deal, we would have been swapping our fifth best central defender for another fifth best central defender.""  Under the circumstances, United concluded there was no point. If anything sums up what seems to be a divergence of opinion over the short-term strategy at Manchester United, it is the treatment of Anthony Martial. In the United States, less than 20 days ago, it became apparent Mourinho was willing to let Martial leave. Anthony Martial was left out of France's World Cup squad this summer The decision was based around the comments of Martial's agent, Philippe Lamboley, who in a TV interview in June said that ""after considering all the factors and possibilities"" his client wanted out. In truth, the position suited Mourinho, who concluded a long time ago that Martial, who has a maximum two years left on his contract, goes missing at big moments. Evidently, that view is not shared by others at Old Trafford. The one conversation between Woodward and Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy this summer centred around the availability of Martial and Juan Mata. In both instances, Levy was told no. As the transfer window entered its final week, rumours surfaced that Martial might be sold to fund a move for Inter Milan's Ivan Perisic, of whom Mourinho is a long-standing admirer. Sources at Old Trafford were adamant that Martial would not be sold. So it has proved. Given Manchester United do not have a director of football, it is not absolutely clear who is making footballing decisions that contradict Mourinho's. And, despite Martial remaining, there is no obligation on the manager to pick him, which is exactly what happened at the weekend when the Frenchman remained in Manchester for a double training session rather than flying to Munich for United's final pre-season friendly. The reason for his absence? Martial returning to France for the birth of his daughter which ended his United States tour a week early. ""There is no story,"" said Mourinho. ""He had three days of pre-season. Then he had nine where he did no training and no football. Absolutely nothing [about it]. If you do that, you have to start again with the other people."" If Mourinho's ""difficult season"" assessment is taken at face value, the Portuguese is heading towards a turbulent few months. It is clear he has not got the players he wanted. Mourinho has given youth a chance at Old Trafford but he is also of the view that if Manchester City's dominance is going to be challenged, it must be with a core of experienced, top-quality players, who tend to be around 29 years of age with little resale value. Those responsible for signing the cheques tend to look longer term. Paul Pogba, for instance, was bought at huge cost, £89m, and comes with an enormous social media following, 5.62m on Twitter alone. In the modern game, such things matter. Paul Pogba has been reportedly linked with a move to Barcelona this summer, having won the World Cup with France in July So, whether Mourinho wanted to or not - and there is no evidence he did - Pogba would not have been sold this summer, despite suggestions the Frenchman would be open to exiting Old Trafford for a second time. United must also factor in market volatility in assessing their transfer dealings.  Neymar's £200m move from Barcelona to Paris St-Germain 12 months ago might be dismissed as an exception. But it created a ripple effect that led to Barcelona signing Ousmane Dembele and Philippe Coutinho for £135.5m and £142m respectively. Sir Alex Ferguson was ridiculed for saying there was ""no value in the market"" but United have to think seriously before adopting a ""pay what it takes"" stance. Ultimately, Mourinho has at his disposal the same squad that finished runners-up last season, minus the retired Michael Carrick, and plus Brazil World Cup midfielder Fred and teenage full-back Diogo Dalot.  In addition, to his satisfaction but the chagrin of many United fans, Mourinho also has Marouane Fellaini, who ended months of speculation by signing a two-year contract at the end of June. Will it be enough to close a 19-point gap to Manchester City and at the same time hold off an anticipated threat from a resurgent Liverpool? Mourinho says by the end of November it will be known which clubs will be Premier League title contenders. If Manchester United are not one of them, no-one would be surprised if those in charge start to get a succession plan prepared."
Volatility,Farmers facing price rises fear volatile times,2024-09-25,2022-03-10,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-essex-60663031,"There are fears food supply could be affected as a result of the war in Ukraine, according to members of the farming industry. Farmer Guy Smith, from Essex, said the price of fertiliser had trebled and it felt like ""very volatile times"". The National Farmers' Union (NFU) warned farmers were facing rapidly increasing prices.  The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said it was trying to find ""long-term solutions"". Mr Smith, who farms in St Osyth, said nitrogen fertiliser was becoming more expensive and so was using 25% less than normal on his wheat crops. He said he feared prices would increase as a result.  ""Food will become more expensive. And what is really worrying is that for parts of the world where people aren't as well off as they are in this country, food could become short and that's very worrying,"" he said. ""I've been farming now for 30 to 40 years and I have never seen fertiliser treble and never seen the wheat price double. ""These are very volatile times."" Russia and Ukraine, once dubbed ""the breadbasket of Europe"", export about a quarter of the world's wheat and half of its sunflower products, such as seeds and oil. Andrew Dewing who manages and owns a grain trade business in Aylsham, Norfolk, said the increased price was a short-term benefit for suppliers in the UK, but the lack of fertiliser could cause problems for future crops. ""It's important to say that a farmer might benefit price-wise this year but they're not going to benefit in future years if this is ongoing.  ""[They] may not be able to produce crops at the same level or might not get the supply of fertiliser anyway,"" he said. An NFU spokesman said: ""The impact of the conflict has seen prices rise even further for everyone.  ""For farmers, prices of fertiliser and animal feed in particular is increasing rapidly.  ""To maintain confidence and stability in the supply chain, we have highlighted some short and long-term asks of government that can help navigate the extreme volatility we are seeing today and will grow in the coming months."" The NFU is calling on the Government to prioritise food security and sustainable food production, preserve and protect gas supplies for food production and processing and create a market monitoring group to identify and resolve potential problems.  Speaking in the House of Commons on Thursday, the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Secretary, George Eustice, said the Government was taking a number of steps including setting up a group to work with industry to ""identify better, long-term solutions that rely less on the price of gas"". He also said they had been working with the UK's producer of fertiliser to maintain production. Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

Volatility,How chemical weapons have helped Assad,2024-09-25,2018-10-14,By Nawal al-Maghafi,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-45586903,"After seven devastating years of civil war in Syria, which have left more than 350,000 people dead, President Bashar al-Assad appears close to victory against the forces trying to overthrow him.  So how has Mr Assad got so close to winning this bloody, brutal war? A joint investigation by BBC Panorama and BBC Arabic shows for the first time the extent to which chemical weapons have been crucial to his war-winning strategy.  Source: BBC Panorama and BBC Arabic research. Map built with Carto. The BBC has determined there is enough evidence to be confident that at least 106 chemical attacks have taken place in Syria since September 2013, when the president signed the international Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) and agreed to destroy the country's chemical weapons stockpile. Syria ratified the CWC a month after a chemical weapons attack on several suburbs of the capital, Damascus, that involved the nerve agent Sarin and left hundreds of people dead. The horrific pictures of victims convulsing in agony shocked the world. Western powers said the attack could only have been carried out by the government, but Mr Assad blamed the opposition. The US threatened military action in retaliation but relented when Mr Assad's key ally, Russia, persuaded him to agree to the elimination of Syria's chemical arsenal. Despite the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) and the United Nations destroying all 1,300 tonnes of chemicals that the Syrian government declared, chemical weapons attacks in the country have continued. ""Chemical attacks are terrifying,"" said Abu Jaafar, who lived in an opposition-held part of the city of Aleppo until it fell to government forces in 2016. ""A barrel bomb or a rocket kills people instantly without them feeling it... but the chemicals suffocate. It's a slow death, like drowning someone, depriving them of oxygen. It's horrifying."" But Mr Assad has continued to deny his forces have ever used chemical weapons. ""We don't have a chemical arsenal since we gave it up in 2013,"" he said earlier this year. ""The [OPCW] made investigations about this, and it's clear that we don't have them."" The OPCW, the global watchdog that oversees implementation of the Chemical Weapons Convention, says a chemical weapon is a chemical used to cause intentional death or harm through its toxic properties. The use of chemical weapons is prohibited under international humanitarian law regardless of the presence of a valid military target, as the effects of such weapons are indiscriminate by nature and designed to cause superfluous injury and unnecessary suffering. Since 2014, the OPCW's Fact-Finding Mission (FFM) in Syria and the now-disbanded OPCW-UN Joint Investigative Mechanism (JIM) have investigated allegations of the use of toxic chemicals for hostile purposes in Syria. They have determined that 37 incidents have involved or are likely to have involved the use of chemicals as weapons between September 2013 and April 2018. The UN Human Rights Council's Independent International Commission of Inquiry (COI) on Syria and other UN-affiliated bodies have meanwhile concluded that there are reasonable grounds to believe that chemical weapons have been used in 18 other cases. Panorama and BBC Arabic examined 164 reports of chemical attacks alleged to have happened since Syria signed up to the CWC just over five years ago. The BBC team determined that there was credible evidence to be confident a chemical weapon was used in 106 of those 164 incidents. While only a few of these attacks have made headlines, the data suggests a pattern of repeated and sustained use of chemical weapons. ""The use of chemical weapons has delivered some outcomes for [government forces] that they believe are worth the risk, and [chemical weapons] have subsequently been shown to be worth the risk because they keep using them, repeatedly,"" said Julian Tangaere, former head of the OPCW mission to Syria. Karen Pierce, the United Kingdom's permanent representative to the UN in New York, described the use of chemical weapons in Syria as ""vile"". ""Not just because of the truly awful effects but also because they are a banned weapon, prohibited from use for nearly 100 years,"" she said. The BBC team considered 164 reports of chemical attacks from September 2013 onwards. The reports were from a variety of sources considered broadly impartial and not involved in the fighting. They included international bodies, human rights groups, medical organisations and think tanks.   In line with investigations carried out by the UN and the OPCW, BBC researchers, with the help of several independent analysts, reviewed the open source data available for each of the reported attacks, including victim and witness testimonies, photographs and videos. The BBC team had their methodology checked by specialist researchers and experts. The BBC researchers discounted all incidents where there was only one source, or where they concluded there was not sufficient evidence. In all, they determined there was enough credible evidence to be confident a chemical weapon was used in 106 incidents.   The BBC team were not allowed access to film on the ground in Syria and could not visit the scenes of reported incidents, and therefore were not able to categorically verify the evidence. However, they did weigh up the strength of the available evidence in each case, including the video footage and pictures from each incident, as well as the details of location and timing. The highest number of reported attacks took place in the north-western province of Idlib. There were also many incidents in the neighbouring provinces of Hama and Aleppo, and in the Eastern Ghouta region near Damascus, according to the BBC's data. All of these areas have been opposition strongholds at various times during the war. The locations where the most casualties were reported as a result of alleged chemical attacks were Kafr Zita, in Hama province, and Douma, in the Eastern Ghouta. Both towns have seen battles between opposition fighters and government forces. According to the reports, the deadliest single incident took place in the town of Khan Sheikhoun, in Idlib province, on 4 April 2017. Opposition health authorities say more than 80 people died that day. Although chemical weapons are deadly, UN human rights experts have noted that most incidents in which civilians are killed and maimed have involved the unlawful use of conventional weapons, such as cluster munitions and explosive weapons in civilian populated areas. Inspectors from an OPCW-UN joint mission announced in June 2014 that they had completed the removal or destruction of all of Syria's declared chemical weapons material, in line with the agreement brokered by the US and Russia after the 2013 Sarin attack. ""Everything that we knew to be there was either removed or destroyed,"" said Mr Tangaere, one of the OPCW inspectors. But, he explained, the inspectors only had the information they were given. ""All we could do was to verify what we'd been told was there,"" he said. ""The thing about the Chemical Weapons Convention is it's all based on trust."" The OPCW did, however, identify what it called ""gaps, inconsistencies and discrepancies"" in Syria's declaration that a team from the watchdog is still trying to resolve. In July 2018, the OPCW's then-director general, Ahmet Üzümcü, told the UN Security Council that the team was ""continuing its efforts to clarify all outstanding issues"". Despite the June 2014 announcement that Syria's declared chemical weapons material had been removed or destroyed, reports of continued chemical attacks continued to emerge. Abdul Hamid Youssef lost his wife, his 11-month-old twins, two brothers, his cousin and many of his neighbours in the 4 April 2017 attack on Khan Sheikhoun. He described the scene outside his home, seeing neighbours and family members suddenly drop to the ground. ""They were shivering, and foam was coming out of their mouths,"" he said. ""It was terrifying. That's when I knew it was a chemical attack."" After falling unconscious and being taken to hospital, he woke, asking about his wife and children. ""After about 15 minutes, they brought them all to me - dead. I lost the most precious people in my life."" The OPCW-UN Joint Investigative Mission concluded that a large number of people had been exposed to Sarin that day.  Sarin is considered 20 times as deadly as cyanide. As with all nerve agents, it inhibits the action of an enzyme which deactivates signals that cause human nerve cells to fire. The heart and other muscles - including those involved in breathing - spasm. Sufficient exposure can lead to death by asphyxiation within minutes. The JIM also said it was confident that the Syrian government was responsible for the release of the Sarin in Khan Sheikhoun, with an aircraft alleged to have dropped a bomb on the town. The images from Khan Sheikhoun prompted US President Donald Trump to order a missile strike on the Syrian Air Force base from where Western powers believed the aircraft that attacked the town took off. President Assad said the incident in Khan Sheikhoun was fabricated, while Russia said the Syrian Air Force bombed a ""terrorist ammunition depot"" that was full of chemical weapons, inadvertently releasing a toxic cloud. But Stefan Mogl, a member of the OPCW team that investigated the attack, said he found evidence that the Sarin used in Khan Sheikhoun belonged to the Syrian government. There was a ""clear match"" between the Sarin and the samples brought back from Syria in 2014 by the OPCW team eliminating the country's stockpile, he said. The JIM report said the Sarin identified in the samples taken from Khan Sheikhoun was most likely to have been made with a precursor chemical - methylphosphonyl difluoride (DF) - from Syria's original stockpile.    ""It means that not everything was removed,"" Mr Mogl said. Mr Tangaere, who oversaw the OPCW's elimination of Syria's chemical stockpile, said: ""I can only assume that that material wasn't part of what was declared and wasn't at the site that we were at."" ""The reality is, under our mandate all we could do was verify what we'd been told was there. There was a separate process to investigate potential gaps in the declaration."" But what of the other 105 reported attacks mapped by the BBC team? Who is believed to have been behind those? The JIM concluded that two attacks involving the blister agent sulphur mustard were carried out by the jihadist group Islamic State. There is evidence suggesting IS carried out three other reported attacks, according to the BBC's data. The JIM and OPCW have so far not concluded that any opposition armed groups other than IS have carried out a chemical attack. The BBC's investigation also found no credible evidence to suggest otherwise. However, the Syrian government and Russia have accused opposition fighters of using chemical weapons on a number of occasions and have reported them to the OPCW, who have investigated the allegations. Opposition armed factions have denied using chemical weapons. The available evidence, including video, photographs and eyewitness testimony, suggests that at least 51 of the 106 reported attacks were launched from the air. The BBC believes all the air-launched attacks were carried out by Syrian government forces. Although Russian aircraft have conducted thousands of strikes in support of Mr Assad since 2015, UN human rights experts on the Commission of Inquiry have said there are no indications that Russian forces have ever used chemical weapons in the Syria. The OPCW has likewise found no evidence that opposition armed groups had the capability to mount air attacks in the cases it has investigated. Tobias Schneider of the Global Public Policy Institute has also investigated whether the opposition could have staged any air-launched chemical attacks and concluded that they could not. ""The Assad regime is the only actor deploying chemical weapons by air,"" he said. Dr Lina Khatib, head of the Middle East and North Africa programme at Chatham House, said: ""The majority of chemical weapons attacks that we have seen in Syria seem to follow a pattern that indicates that they were the work of the regime and its allies, and not other groups in Syria."" ""Sometimes the regime uses chemical weapons when it doesn't have the military capacity to take an area back using conventional weapons,"" she added.   Sarin was used in the deadliest of the 106 reported attacks - at Khan Sheikhoun - but the evidence suggests that the most commonly used toxic chemical was chlorine. Chlorine is what is known as a ""dual-use"" chemical. It has many legitimate peaceful civilian uses, but its use as a weapon is banned by the CWC. Chlorine is thought to have been used in 79 of the 106 reported attacks, according to the BBC's data. The OPCW and JIM have determined that chlorine is likely to have been used as a weapon in 15 of the cases they have investigated. Experts say it is notoriously difficult to prove the use of chlorine in an attack because its volatility means it evaporates and disperses quickly.  ""If you go to a site where a chlorine attack has happened, it's almost impossible to get physical evidence from the environment - unless you're there within a very short period of time,"" said Mr Tangaere, the former OPCW inspector. ""In that sense, being able to use it leaving virtually no evidence behind, you can see why it has happened many, many times over."" Plotting the timings and locations of the 106 reported chemical attacks appears to reveal a pattern in how they have been used. Many of the reported attacks occurred in clusters in and around the same areas and at around the same times. These clusters coincided with government offensives - in Hama and Idlib in 2014, in Idlib in 2015, in Aleppo city at the end of 2016, and in the Eastern Ghouta in early 2018. ""Chemical weapons are used whenever the regime wants to send a strong message to a local population that their presence is not desirable,"" said Chatham House's Dr Khatib. ""In addition to chemical weapons being the ultimate punishment, instilling fear in people, they are also cheap and convenient for the regime at a time when its military capacity has decreased because of the conflict."" ""There's nothing that scares people more than chemical weapons, and whenever chemical weapons have been used, residents have fled those areas and, more often than not, not come back."" Aleppo, a city fought over for several years, appears to be one of the locations where such a strategy has been employed. Opposition fighters and civilians were trapped in a besieged enclave in the east as the government launched its final offensive to regain full control of the city. Opposition-held areas first came under heavy bombardment with conventional munitions. Then came a series of reported chemical attacks that are said to have caused hundreds of casualties. Aleppo soon fell to the government, and people were displaced to other opposition-held areas. ""The pattern that we are witnessing is that the regime uses chemical weapons in areas that it regards as strategic for its own purposes,"" said Dr Khatib. ""[The] final stage of taking these areas back seems to be using chemical weapons to just make the local population flee."" From late November to December 2016, in the final weeks of the government's assault on eastern Aleppo, there were 11 reported chlorine attacks. Five of them were in the last two days of the offensive, before opposition fighters and supporters surrendered and agreed to be evacuated. Abu Jaafar, who worked for the Syrian opposition as a forensic scientist, was in Aleppo during the last days of the siege. He examined the bodies of many of the victims of alleged chemical attacks. ""I went to the morgue and a strong smell of chlorine emanated from the bodies,"" he said. ""When I inspected them, I saw clear marks of suffocation due to chlorine."" The use of chlorine had a devastating effect, he said. ""The gas suffocates people - spreading panic and terror,"" he said. ""There were warplanes and helicopters in the sky all the time, as well as artillery shelling. But what left the biggest impact was chemical weapons."" When liquid chlorine is released, it quickly turns into a gas. The gas is heavier than air and will sink to low-lying areas. People hiding in basements or underground bomb shelters are therefore particularly vulnerable to exposure. When chlorine gas comes into contact with moist tissues such as the eyes, throats and lungs, an acid is produced that can damage those tissues. When inhaled, chlorine causes air sacs in the lungs to secrete fluid, essentially drowning those affected. ""If they go up, they get bombed by rockets. If they go down, they get killed by chlorine. People were hysterical,"" said Abu Jaafar.   The Syrian government has said it has never used chlorine as a weapon. But all 11 of the reported attacks in Aleppo came from the air and occurred in opposition-held areas, according to the BBC's data. More than 120,000 civilians left Aleppo in the final weeks of the battle for the city, according to organisations on the ground. It was a turning point in the civil war. A similar pattern of reported chemical weapons use can be seen in the data from the Eastern Ghouta - the opposition's final stronghold near Damascus. A number of attacks were reported in opposition-held towns in the region between January and April 2018. Maps show how the incidents coincided with the loss of opposition territory. Douma, the biggest town in the Eastern Ghouta, was the target of four reported chemical attacks over four months, as pro-government forces intensified their aerial bombardment before launching a ground offensive. The last - and deadliest, according to medics and rescue workers - incident took place on 7 April, when a yellow industrial gas cylinder was reportedly dropped onto the balcony of a block of flats. The opposition's surrender came a day later. Videos published by pro-opposition activists showed what they said were the bodies of more than 30 children, women and men who had been sheltering downstairs in the basement of the block of flats. Yasser al-Domani, an activist who visited the scene that night, said the people who died had foam around their mouths and appeared to have chemical burns. Another video from a nearby building shows the bodies of the same children found dead in the block of flats wearing the same clothes, with the same burns, lined up for identification. The BBC spoke to 18 people, who all insist they saw bodies being taken from the block of flats to the hospital. Two days after the reported attack, Russian military specialists visited the block of flats and said they found no traces of chlorine or any other chemical agents. The Russian government said the incident had been staged by the opposition with the help of the UK - a charge the British government dismissed as ""grotesque and absurd"". An OPCW Fact-Finding Mission team visited the scene almost two weeks later and took samples from the gas cylinder on the balcony. In July, it reported that ""various chlorinated organic chemicals"" were found in the samples, along with residues of explosive. The FFM is still working to establish the significance of the results, but Western powers are convinced the people who died were exposed to chlorine. A week after the incident in Douma, the US, UK and France carried out air strikes on three sites they said were ""specifically associated with the Syrian regime's chemical weapons programme"". The Western strikes took place hours before the Syrian military declared the Eastern Ghouta free of opposition fighters, by which time some 140,000 people had fled their homes and up to 50,000 had been evacuated to opposition-held territory in the north of the country. ""I saw the amount of destruction, the people crying, bidding farewell to their homes or children. People's miserable, exhausted faces, it was really painful. I can't forget it. People in the end said they'd had enough,"" said Manual Jaradeh, who was living in Douma with her husband and son. The Syrian government would not answer the BBC's questions about the allegations that it has used chemical weapons. It refused to allow the Panorama team to travel to Damascus, examine the site of the reported attack in Douma, and turned down interview requests. When asked whether the international community had failed the Syrian people, former OPCW inspector Julian Tangaere said: ""Yes, I think it has. ""It was a life and death struggle for the Assad regime. You know, there was certainly no turning back. I can understand that. ""But the methods used, and the barbarity of some of what's happened has... well, it's beyond comprehension. It's horrifying."" So has President Assad got away with it? Karen Pierce, the UK's ambassador to the UN, thinks not. ""There is evidence being collected,"" she said. ""One day there will be justice. We will do our best to try to bring that about and hasten it."" Panorama: Syria's Chemical War will be broadcast in the UK on Monday 15 October on BBC One at 20:30. It will be available afterwards on the  BBC iPlayer. It will also be broadcast on BBC Arabic on Tuesday 23 October at 19:05 GMT. Credits: Producers Alys Cummings and Kate Mead.

Volatility,NI economy weakens bucking UK trend,2024-09-25,2019-05-13,By John Campbell,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-48244813,"Northern Ireland's economy appears to have weakened significantly over the past three months, research from Ulster Bank has suggested. The bank conducts a monthly survey of private sector activity in what is considered a reliable indicator of the economy. April saw a contraction in new orders, exports, employment and overall output. That follows a fall in output in March and a weakening employment performance since the start of the year. Richard Ramsey, the bank's chief economist, said it was the sharpest fall in business activity since the end of 2012. ""April saw an improvement in business conditions across most of the UK regions,"" he said. ""However, Northern Ireland was a notable exception to this trend. ""Rather than improving, the pace of contraction across a range of indicators accelerated."" He added that Brexit and the lack of a Northern Ireland Executive continued to be cited as factors negatively affecting business. As in March, manufacturing was the only sector to record an expansion in output. By contrast, the data for retail sales was the worst in almost seven years. Mr Ramsey said that the survey should not be interpreted as a clear sign of the beginning of a downturn as Brexit factors could be responsible for volatility in some company performances. By John Campbell, BBC News NI Economics and Business Editor A modern economy is a complex, dynamic system - changes are rarely about one factor. However, it is clear that Brexit is having an impact in some areas - particularly business investment. But there are other forces shaping our economy - for example, retailing is in the throes of technologically-driven change, which has nothing to do with Brexit. Official data for the whole of the UK, published last week, suggested the economy picked up in the first three months of the year after manufacturers' stockpiling ahead of Brexit helped to boost growth. Growth was 0.5% in the quarter, up from 0.2% in the previous three months, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. The manufacturing sector grew at its fastest rate since 1988 in the period. The ONS said this was driven by manufacturers rushing to deliver orders before the original Brexit deadline of 29 March. Pharmaceuticals was one of the sectors most affected, expanding 9.4% between January and March. Previous business surveys had shown manufacturers stockpiling goods for Brexit in case the UK left the EU without a transition deal, which they feared could lead to delays at UK borders."
Volatility,Ministers move to combat butter shortage,2024-09-25,2017-10-06,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-41527710,"The Scottish government has announced ""urgent"" action to help bakers and shortbread makers in the wake of a butter shortage. A feasibility study will be carried out to see if collective buying and storing of butter is an option that could help combat shortages and rising costs. The Scottish Agricultural Organisation Society (SAOS) has been tasked with the work. It will also look at ways to combat volatility in the butter industry. A supply shortage combined with rising demand has seen wholesale butter prices rise to record highs this year. In July, the boss of dairy giant Arla warned that the UK could be facing a butter and cream shortage this Christmas. Peder Tuborgh said there was insufficient milk being supplied by farmers to make the products, but the National Farmers' Union described his comments as ""scaremongering"". Rural Economy Secretary Fergus Ewing told an audience at the RBS Food and Drink conference that the food and drink sector was a ""significant and growing part of our economy"" and ministers wanted to support manufacturers ""particularly during times of economic pressure"". He said: ""The price of wholesale butter has doubled since the start of the year, with wholesale prices at a record high. ""This is a concern for many of our smaller food and drink manufacturers who use butter as a primary ingredient, such as our shortbread and confectionery producers and bakeries, and who are finding trading tough."" He added: ""We have listened to the concerns of our manufacturers and this urgent feasibility study will explore opportunities to exploit buying and efficiency savings made available through collaboration, boosting productivity and competitiveness within domestic and global markets. ""We expect to see the outcome of the study within the next month or so and we look forward to supporting the industry in whatever way we can."" The feasibility study is being funded from the £1m Market Driven Supply Chain (MDSC) project, which the Scottish government established in March."
Volatility,Bank of England steps in to calm markets,2024-09-25,2022-09-28,By Daniel Thomas & Noor Nanji,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63061614,"The Bank of England has said it will step in to calm markets after the government's tax-cutting plans sparked a fall in the pound and caused borrowing costs to surge. It warned that if the market volatility continued there would be a ""material risk to UK financial stability"". The Bank will start buying government bonds at an ""urgent pace"" to help restore ""orderly market conditions"". The pound, which has been volatile, rose 1.4% against the dollar to $1.08.  It comes after the currency hit a record low on Monday following the chancellor's mini-budget, which pledged $45bn worth of tax cuts, funded by borrowing, as part of a plan to boost economic growth.   The government borrows money to fund its spending plans by selling bonds, or ""gilts"", to investors such as pension funds and big banks on international markets.  The investor then gets to receive a stream of future payments, or ""yield"", based on the interest rate the government has offered.  Due to concerns over whether the government's plan will work, investors have been demanding much higher interest rates to lend to the UK government. But the Bank now hopes to lower these prices by buying its bonds.  The government's long-term borrowing costs fell after the bank's intervention on Wednesday, although still remains high. The Bank of England was forced to intervene after the market turmoil put pressure on pension funds, which invest in government bonds because they are usually so stable. So called Liability Driven Investment funds - which support defined benefit pensions schemes - were facing a collapse in the value of the bonds they hold, which in turn could have forced them to rush to sell other assets, sparking yet more market panic. However, industry group the Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association (PLSA) said that ""pension schemes are long-term investors and moments like this come from time to time"". ""While this is a complex situation as there has been a lot of volatility in the gilt markets in recent days, we would not expect any significant issues for savers,"" said Joe Dabrowski, deputy director of the PLSA. Nevertheless, he said there will be ""some operational challenges and pressures on liquidity"" in the short term. Mr Dabrowski added that ""this is not ideal, [but] they are challenges that can be overcome and the statement from the Bank of England is a helpful step to achieving that"".  The Bank has already said it will ""not hesitate"" to hike interest rates to try and protect the pound and try and stem surging prices. Some economists have predicted the Bank of England will raise the interest rate from the current 2.25% to 5.8% by next spring.  The projection has led hundreds of mortgage products to be taken off the market.  The Bank said its bond purchases would be ""time limited"" and carried out on ""whatever scale is necessary"" to ease investor concerns. It will also postpone the planned start of a gilt sale programme that was only announced last week.  Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said the Bank had been forced to step in to avoid the early stages of a financial crisis and warned fears over the economic outlook were growing.  ""This shows that the Bank is going to do all it can to prevent a financial crisis and it is already working. While this is welcome, the fact that it needed to be done in the first place shows that the UK markets are in a perilous position.  ""It wouldn't be a huge surprise if another problem in the financial markets popped up before long."" Despite the Bank's action, the pound continued to fall with some analysts warning it could even reach parity with the dollar.  ""What today shows us, is that the market doesn't see this as a problem that just the Bank of England can clean up,"" she said. ""This is just firefighting,"" said Jane Foley, a currency strategist at Rabobank. She said pressure was growing on the government to make clear the financial cost of its tax cut and spending plans. There has been widespread criticism of the government's plan, with International Monetary Fund warning on Tuesday that the measures are likely to fuel the cost-of-living crisis and increase inequality. The government says it will not reverse its tax cuts, but has promised to release further plans to boost growth and reduce public debt on 23 November. In a statement, the Treasury acknowledged global financial markets had seen ""significant volatility"" in recent days. It said Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng was ""committed"" to the Bank's independence, adding: ""The government will continue to work closely with the Bank in support of its financial stability and inflation objectives."" But Labour called on the chancellor to urgently clarify how he planned to stabilise the economy. Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said people would be ""deeply worried"" about the cost of their mortgage, about their pensions, and the cost of living. ""The Chancellor must make an urgent statement on how he is going to fix the crisis that he has made."" This is an immense show of force from the Bank of England trying to calm borrowing markets. It does raise some questions. It underlines that this is a crisis, and the Bank has responded in emergency mode. The clear cause of this crisis was the chancellor's mini budget, leading to a loss of market confidence and spiralling borrowing rates on government debt, which it says could become a ""material risk to financial stability"". So it will now, for a temporary period, buy up those loans in unlimited quantities. The effective interest rate being charged to the UK government in these markets was spiralling to 20 year highs. That has now fallen back. But it was not a decision made by the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee, who were informed of the decision after it was made by the Bank's financial experts. It actually comes as the Committee had been set to enact the exact reverse policy - selling government debts. The process was due to start next week and has been delayed. It is a massive intervention, but it could confuse markets about the clarity of policy making and lines of accountability. Sterling has fallen sharply again, close to all time lows. This will not solve the government's problems. It might buy them some time."
Volatility,Bolsonaro flying back to Brazil from US,2024-09-25,2023-03-30,By Luis Fajardo in Miami & Adam Durbin in London,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-65120313,"Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro is on his way back to Brazil, after spending months in the US. The far-right politician is returning for the first time since supporters stormed the Supreme Court, Congress and presidential palace in January. The riots came after weeks of protests claiming fraud in his defeat to President to Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. Speaking at an airport in Florida before boarding a flight, he said he would not lead the opposition to Lula. But in an interview with CNN, Mr Bolsonaro also said he would help his Liberal Party as a ""person with experience"" and that he intended to travel across Brazil to campaign in next year's local elections. After arriving in the terminal in Orlando, he spoke and took pictures with throngs of supporters.  Mr Bolsonaro is scheduled to land in the Brazilian capital, Brasília, early on Thursday local time (three hours behind GMT). The former president faces numerous legal challenges on his return, including an investigation into whether he incited rioters who stormed key government buildings a week after Lula's inauguration. He is also at the centre of a scandal over allegations that he tried to illegally import and keep millions of dollars' worth of jewellery given to him and his wife by Saudi Arabia in 2019. The jewels were impounded by Brazilian customs officials when a member of Mr Bolsonaro's entourage tried to bring them into the country in 2021. On Wednesday, federal police summoned Mr Bolsonaro to testify in the Saudi case on 5 April.  In addition, he faces 16 cases before Brazil's Superior Electoral Tribunal (TSE), which could prevent him running for office for eight years, removing him from the 2026 presidential race. He left the country in December before his successor was sworn in, travelling to Florida and applying for a six-month US tourist visa. Mr Bolsonaro narrowly lost the presidential election last October to his left-wing rival, which led to unsubstantiated claims by his supporters of voting fraud - eventually escalating into the violent scenes in the capital.  He has voiced ""regret"" for the unrest but denies he caused it. However, Brazil's Supreme Court has agreed to include him in its investigation into the storming of government buildings on 8 January. On that day thousands of radical Bolsonaro supporters, who continue to say the election was rigged, stormed the country's Supreme Court, Congress and presidential palace in Brasília. They had been camping in and around the city for weeks calling for a military coup and more than 1,200 people are being charged over the riot.  In February, Brazilian Senator Marcos do Val said Mr Bolsonaro was at a meeting in December about a plot to keep him in power, alleging he was asked to get the head of the electoral authority to compromise himself to discredit the presidential election. Neither he nor his representatives have yet commented on Mr do Val's remarks. Mr Bolsonaro's return to Brazil creates risks and uncertainty for his country, the Lula administration and for himself. It is hard to tell how the politically polarised Brazilian public will react to his presence.  For the last 89 days, as Mr Bolsonaro spent his extended holiday in the US, the former head of state had appeared only occasionally in the media. He was sometimes seen eating at fast food restaurants, like he was just another tourist relaxing during his carefree Florida vacation. But Mr Bolsonaro is now returning to a tense situation back home. Brazilian media are reporting that the federal police have activated special security plans for his arrival and are asking his followers to abstain from organising a large, crowded event to welcome him at the airport. According to CNN, police expressed objections to his original desire to be driven through the streets of Brasilia in an open-top car. Authorities were also moving to cordon off the Esplanade of the Ministries, the ceremonial heart of the capital, which is home to the government buildings stormed on 8 January. Mr Bolsonaro being under investigation over allegations that he and some of his close advisers played some role in instigating the rioting is not his only legal problem.  Several other investigations by Brazilian authorities are examining allegations of his participation in electoral disinformation and other potential irregularities, some of which could be punishable with a prison sentence.    Because of this, many Brazilian observers had expected Mr Bolsonaro to try to extend his stay in the US. Instead, he now returns to Brazil to face an uncertain personal situation.   Having denied, as he boarded his flight, that he wanted to lead the opposition, Mr Bolsonaro promises he only wants to offer the country his expertise after years in public service.  But his arrival in Brazil will probably mean additional problems for Lula, who is already struggling in the early months of his new administration to recapture the popularity he enjoyed when he first occupied the presidency from 2003 to 2010.  Mr Bolsonaro remains a powerful antagonist who still enjoys the support of millions of Brazilians.  He will also probably remain a polarising figure. Most expect him to continue generating the high levels of controversy he once attracted in office, when his abrasive style earned him the nickname of the ""Trump of the Tropics"".   Mr Bolsonaro's return is likely to add to the volatility of the Brazilian political scene and to speculation about what his own fate, political, legal and otherwise, has in store for him. "
Volatility,Scottish independence: a choice of uncertainties,2024-09-25,2022-10-17,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-63293427,"The astonishing reversal of the Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng budget threatened to eclipse an important day for the cause of Scottish independence. Jeremy Hunt was sidelining a prime minister who is little more than a month in the job, while sucking much of the air out of news media space. But with eclipse came opportunity. The new Chancellor of the Exchequer was also providing the latest episode in a series of events that could hardly have done more to weaken the case for Scotland remaining in the UK because of its long-standing stability, a reputation for good governance or its international standing. Speaking from her Bute House official residence, Nicola Sturgeon slotted home that shot at an open goal, before embarking on an economic case which sought to balance attack with defence. On the front foot, the document offers a vision of a fairer, green Scottish economy. Lots of Scots can sign up for the list of improvements. They reflect on what is perceived to be a different consensus or middle ground in Scottish politics. But the vision is little more than a wish list. We can attach our own preferences, and project them on to this blank screen of possibilities. To make them into a reality requires the choosing of priorities, building of alliances, in many cases finding the funds, and addressing the areas where there are potential trade-offs. For instance, you can raise minimum wages for young people, but in a less tight labour market than we currently have, what if that prices them out of the market for jobs which can be done by someone with more experience?  More obviously, while there are positives about membership of the European Union - freedom to live and work in the EU among them, and to recruit from the EU - there are negatives about the potential trade friction with the rest of the UK.  Nicola Sturgeon's defences are taking more time and effort. The transition to a new currency remains a hard one to sell to the public, when so much of the plan is uncertain, and it depends on moving parts over which even an independent country has little or no control. The gap between spending levels and estimated tax take from Scots starts off at an unsustainable level. And if those aspirations for a different type of economy are to be met, the gap can be expected to grow. The plan promises the kind of fiscal discipline rules and institutional safeguards that are intended to avoid the debacle that befell the Truss/Kwarteng budget. But by pointing to the volatility of figures throughout Covid and now the surge in inflation, they decline to say how tight the squeeze might be on spending. Until the Scottish Fiscal Commission gets to look at the actual numbers facing an independent Scottish government, we won't have an independent assessment of whether the hoped-for growth is likely to materialise. Both of these issues are highlighted by the Institute for Fiscal Studies. The economic blueprint ""makes all the right noises on how the public finances would be managed, emphasising achieving fiscal sustainability,"" says the IFS's David Phillips. ""But it skirts around what achieving sustainability would likely require in the first decade of an independent Scotland: bigger tax rises or spending cuts than the UK government will have to pursue."" He goes on to say that Scotland could grow its way out of Britain's low productivity, ""but boosting productivity and growth is far from certain and would be easier said than done. ""Experience from recent weeks [in Downing Street] suggests the markets may not look favourably on fiscal plans built on the uncertain hope of a substantial future boost to growth."" These are not new challenges, and nor are the policies newly minted. They are close to the position adopted by the SNP when its policy absorbed the whole of the  Sustainable Growth Commission in 2018. That set out the route from sterling to a Scottish currency, and illustrated it with at least nine years of spending being squeezed.   Other significant changes since the 2014 referendum include Europe, with Brexit forcing a different approach. It is the main justification for pushing the case to another vote. Becoming a member offers a trading advantage over the rest of the UK. But it presents the problem of the England-Scotland frontier becoming a hard border. Oil and gas is no longer to be the fountain of cash with which to balance the books. But old habits die hard. While Ms Sturgeon is against further oil and gas developments and would not use oil revenues for day-to-day spending, she is looking to its tax revenues to fill up a big trust fund, while she's already allocating the earnings from that investment fund many years in advance. There was another change in the economic case being made. It was an injection of candour about the difficulties and uncertainties.  Eight years ago, questions and doubts were brushed aside as ""Project Fear"". Nicola Sturgeon now acknowledges the right that people have to question and to doubt, and the responsibility she has to provide persuasive answers. Back in 2014, Alex Salmond said he knew the minds of Whitehall ministers, and would bend their opposition to his will through the force of his negotiating skills. After the experience of Brexit, it's harder to argue that such negotiations would be easy. Ms Sturgeon knows there are uncertainties. What has significantly shifted in her favour is that the UK also brings an unprecedented period of uncertainty. Brexit is a journey to an unknown destination. The governing party at Westminster is severely weakened and divided by events of recent weeks. A referendum this time next year would not be a choice between radical change and the status quo, but between two routes - both quite radical and both quite risky. This would not be a choice between certainty and uncertainty, says Nicola Sturgeon, but between different uncertainties. The question, she adds, is how best to navigate them. On an issue of profound division in Scotland, the first minister might even get agreement on that much."
Volatility,Oil fights to retain its licence to drill,2024-09-25,2023-09-06,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-66726368,"As if attendees need reminding at the enormous Offshore Europe event in Aberdeen this week, prices can go up as well as down. And they're on another Brent crude rollercoaster. The globally-recognised benchmark cocktail of crude oil from several North Sea fields dropped a dollar on the event's first day, then surged three dollars to $91 per barrel. It's at its highest level since last November. In the past three months, the spot crude price is up 16%, and futures by 20%. Along with the pound weakening against the dollar since July, it's feeding through to higher prices for petrol and diesel.  A litre of petrol is up in only a month from £1.45 on average to £1.52 - the fifth largest monthly rise in 23 years. Why? The market reacts to constraints on supply, with Saudia Arabia and Russia saying they will keep the taps turned down for a further three months in order to keep prices up. That takes us into the winter market, when energy demand can go up. On the supply side of the oil market, while prices have been subdued by some expectations of weak economic figures from the US to China meaning weak demand for oil, more recent data have pointed to demand strengthening. Energy traders are saying the Brent crude bench mark could be around $95 by the end of the year. All this looks a lot more subdued than it did last summer. August 2022 saw the peaks of prices for oil and gas. Six months into Russia's invasion of Ukraine, bringing severe disruption to supply, traders rushed to secure supply for last winter.  They succeeded. Europe's and the US's storage was filled ahead of target, and winter turned out to be mild, meaning less fossil fuel is burned. This winter remains a concern for energy planners, because much depends on temperatures. But markets have had 21 months to adapt to the new geo-politics of sanctions against Russia, and to pricing with that new source of volatility. The price of natural gas has fallen and stabilised far more than anyone could have foreseen a year ago. It now trades around  double the trend price before August 2021, when Russia began its squeeze on supply and prices began to rise. But the current price is far below the sky-high spikes seen last summer. For oil, at $90 per barrel, that is a welcome relief for energy users from the $120 peak, and the £2 litre of diesel. As we're seeing with oil this week, however, it doesn't take much to unsettle global markets. Britain used to source its gas through pipelines from entirely predictable suppliers, mostly in the North Sea.  It now buys Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) on the world market, carried on tankers from the Persian Gulf and the USA, and has to compete for tanker-loads with Asian customers. So the threat of a gas drillers' strike as far away as Western Australia, choking off China's supply of LNG gas, has been raising fears of a supply shock in Asia, affecting prices in the UK and Europe. In Aberdeen, at the P&J Arena, venue for Europe's biggest offshore energy gathering this week, higher prices should be good news, meaning more profit on existing production and more investment projects get over the line for approval. But that's not how it's working out in the UK North Sea.  Offshore Energy UK (OEUK), representing oil and gas producers and part of the renewable energy sector, has published a report that says a vast amount of investment is ready for that Final Investment Decision, but it's not getting approved. It calculates there is £200bn could be invested over the next ten years, in both renewable and fossil fuel drilling. Half of that is awaiting sign-off. Oil and gas is getting up to £4bn investment this year - lower than expected because of slow approvals, and less than recent years in real terms due to cost inflation.  A further £35bn  in fossil fuels could be invested over the next ten years, half in existing fields and half in new ones. But 70% of that investment is ""yet to be secured"".  Over those 10 years, the expectation is of £70bn in production costs and £20bn in decommissioning of retired equipment. The industry grouping claims these investment decisions need a stronger business environment for regulation, planning approvals, grid connection consents, licences to explore and produce, the tax regime and government stability. In addition, they face higher financing costs than they did when these projects were in the planning pipeline. The context for this is the turf chosen by Labour and Conservatives to differentiate their approach to climate change and energy security - Labour wanting to stop handing licences for further exploration or production, Conservatives wanting to accelerate that process, and the SNP leadership meanwhile arguing for a higher environmental hurdle for producers to clear. The industry body's annual economic report is usually a sober assessment of its value in jobs, tax paid and the pipeline of projects to keep the industry thriving. It's a statement of progress and of intention. It doesn't read that way in 2023. The document is a hard-argued plea with governments and opposition for the industry's survival.  It is seeking backing for further investment and to maximise domestic production at a time of international volatility. In graphs and stats, it sets out the trajectory for Britain's energy use in the coming decades, and how much of that will continue to be from oil and gas, even if those net zero targets are achieved. The story since the turn of the century, as UK production peaked, is of 70% decline in production but only 28% decline in demand. The UK has gone from net exporter to net importer, in a big way. OEUK seeks to explain that offshore fields are draining fast, and replacing that production will require further field extensions or new fields to open up.  Twenty fields are due to retire this year, with only two opening. Of 283 fields in production this year, more than 180 are expected to stop producing this decade. These ageing fields produced 45% of UK oil and gas output last year.  The report warns: ""The impacts of these trends are already being seen in production. Output in the first five months of this year was down by a tenth from the same period last year (6% decline in gas production and 12% for oil) and down by a fifth from 2018.  ""This is double the rate of decline in oil and gas consumption, leaving the country relying on net imports for around one-third for oil and just over half for gas."" OEUK adds the employment case: 220,000 jobs directly and indirectly employed by oil companies, 93,000 of them in Scotland. Comments from David Whitehouse, chief executive of OEUK, reflect deep frustration that the industry has moved to the centre of the battle for power at next year's election between Conservatives and Labour. ""The transition to net zero will be the biggest engineering project this country has ever seen,"" he says. ""We need consensus to support the very industries and workers whose skills are vital for building our energy future. ""In recent months we have felt the direct impact of underinvestment in homegrown energy on job security for our workers, the competitiveness of our firms internationally and our future energy bills. ""Our report shows that with the right frameworks in place, this industry can make the long-term investments to help the UK tackle these challenges head-on. ""As the global race for energy investment accelerates, the UK must compete by making the most of its diverse homegrown industry, from oil and gas to offshore wind, hydrogen and carbon capture. Globally, this is the lesson other countries have learnt. We must not get left behind."" One big question is not whether Britain's oil and gas industry is in decline, but how fast it is allowed or forced to decline. In terms of barrels of oil or their gas equivalent (boe), 45 billion have been extracted since the Queen pressed the button on the Forties field in 1975. The industry estimate is of up to 10 to 15 billion remaining, but only around 8 billion of these being technically and financially viable.  But if there's a loss of investor confidence, OEUK foresees less than 4 billion being pumped - around quarter of the demand forecast through to 2050. A further question is how fast renewable energy can replace it when it, too, faces planning and consenting obstacles, a different windfall taxand and the higher cost of finance. And a third question is how willing Britain is to rely on imported energy. Any other industry that ensured domestic production of a vital strategic resource, at a time of growing geo-political tension, could expect to be given an easy time by government. But not while there's another battlefront, over climate change. And not when that industry does not protect resources for the UK, but sells them for the best price it can achieve on the global market. The industry's critics - and there are many of them, opposed to its high profits and to the climate damage done by its products - will be happy to see it on the back foot like this. They can produce graphs and stats that show the climate implications of continuing to produce and burn further reserves of fossil fuels.  Armed with data on climate change, they have pushed the energy giants into the centre of the political arena, and forced them to fight - not just for exploration and production licences, but for their social licence to keep drilling."
Volatility,Petrol and diesel prices reach new record high,2024-09-25,2022-02-14,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60375568,"Fuel prices have hit a new record high at the pump across the UK, tightening the squeeze on UK consumers, the motoring organisation the AA has said. Over the weekend petrol reached 148.02p a litre, while diesel hit a new record high of 151.57p a litre last Thursday. Fuel previously hit a record in November, before wholesale and retail prices fell back. ""The cost of living crisis has been ratcheted up yet another notch,"" said Luke Bosdet of the AA. The RAC's fuel spokesman Simon Williams said the price of filling a 55-litre family car was now an ""eye-watering"" £81.41.  ""With the oil price teetering on the brink of $100 a barrel and retailers keen to pass on the increase in wholesale fuel quickly, new records could now be set on a daily basis in the coming weeks,"" he said. Fuel prices at the pump are driven largely by the wholesale price of energy which has shot up due to tensions over whether Russia will invade Ukraine. On Monday, oil prices hit their highest level since 2014, reaching $95.56 a barrel. If the situation in Ukraine deteriorates, oil and gas supplies from Russia to Europe may be interrupted, pushing up wholesale prices further. The supply of oil and gas has already struggled to keep up with growing demand as the global economy picked up in recent months as Covid restrictions eased. The RAC's Mr Williams said: ""On a positive note, retailer margins - which were the reason drivers paid overly high prices in December and January - have now returned to more normal levels of around 7p a litre."" He said the big four supermarkets, which dominate fuel sales, should ""play fair"" with drivers by keeping their profit margins low. Day-to-day prices for food, household bills and other items such as used cars, have risen sharply in recent months, in part due to rising energy prices.  The Petrol Retailers' Association (PRA), which represents independent retailers, said it would continue to ensure that the price of fuel was ""as competitive as possible"". But tensions between Russia and Ukraine, as well as other key factors such as tightness in the oil market and the dollar-sterling exchange rate, were likely to cause further volatility in the oil price, said Gordon Balmer, PRA's executive director. UK inflation is now at a 30-year high of 5.4%. New inflation figures for January will be released by the Office for National Statistics on Wednesday. Mr Bosdet said the AA had surveyed 15,000 of its members after prices spiked at the end of last year and found higher fuel prices were leading 43% of them to cut back on the amount they used their car as well as other areas of spending. Mike Johnson at the energy consultancy Portland Analytics said what happens to energy prices next depended both on the situation in Ukraine and whether the Organisation of Petrol Exporting Countries (Opec) was able to boost supply. ""Opec and its allies have struggled to increase production in line with their output targets due to a combination of production outages and technical issues, whilst demand continues to rise,"" he said. While oil producing nations had agreed to increase production by 400,000 barrels per day in February Mr Johnson said it seemed unlikely that target would be met."
Volatility,Bank's £65bn move driven by pension fund panic,2024-09-25,2022-09-28,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63065415,"The Bank of England stepped in to calm markets after some types of pension funds were at risk of collapse. It pledged to buy £65bn of government bonds after Friday's mini-budget sparked turmoil on financial markets and the pound plunged. Investors had demanded a much higher return for investing in government bonds, causing some to halve in value. Pension funds, which invest in bonds, were forced to start selling, sparking fears of a fresh market downturn. The Bank said its decision to buy government bonds at an ""urgent pace"" was driven by concern over ""a material risk to UK financial stability."" The government borrows money to fund its spending plans by selling bonds, or ""gilts"", to investors such as pension funds and big banks on international markets. But a collapse in the price of those bonds was forcing some pension funds to sell gilts and assets, further forcing down the price. If that process had continued, there was a risk that those pension funds could have got to a position where they couldn't pay their debts. To stop this from happening the Bank said it would buy around £65bn of gilts on Wednesday. Joe Dabrowski, deputy director of industry group the Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association, said: ""While this is a complex situation as there has been a lot of volatility in the gilt markets in recent days, we would not expect any significant issues for savers."" This is an immense show of force from the Bank of England trying to calm borrowing markets. It is already having an impact. It also raises some questions. First and foremost it underlines that this is a crisis, with the Bank responding in emergency mode. The clear cause was the chancellor's mini-budget, leading to a loss of market confidence, and spiralling borrowing rates on government debt. That crash in the value of loans to the government threatened to become a ""material risk to financial stability"", says the Bank. Read more here. The Pensions Regulator said it is monitoring financial markets closely for their impact on the funding of defined benefit, or final salary pension schemes, a spokesperson said. ""We welcome steps announced by the Bank of England to restore orderly conditions through temporary purchases of long-dated UK government bonds,"" the spokesperson added. The pound hit a record low on Monday following the chancellor's mini-budget, which pledged £45bn of tax cuts as part of a plan to boost economic growth.  The level of government borrowing required had shocked investors who questioned the sustainability of the public finances. UK government bond markets and stock markets, which had seen sharp falls, stabilised after the Bank's announcement and the pound also rose slightly. The government has insisted it is standing by its plan despite growing criticism. Treasury minister Andrew Griffith said on Wednesday that its tax cuts were the ""right plans"" to grow the UK economy. He said the Bank of England had ""done their job"" by announcing it would buy government debt to stabilise the economy. It came after the International Monetary Fund openly criticised the government's tax cut plans, warning that the measures were likely to fuel the cost-of-living crisis and increase inequality. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused the government of ""losing control of the economy,""  ""What the government needs to do now is recall Parliament and abandon this budget before any more damage is done,"" he said. While the government says it will not reverse its tax cuts, it has promised to release further plans to boost growth and reduce public debt on 23 November. In a statement, the Treasury said it would continue to work closely with the Bank ""in support of its financial stability and inflation objectives."" Former IMF deputy director Mohamed El-Erian told the BBC's Newsnight that UK policy had been ""incredibly incoherent"", with the government and the Bank of England working at cross-purposes. Meanwhile, chief secretary to the Treasury Chris Philp confirmed on Wednesday that government departments are being asked to find spending cuts. Speaking on ITV's Peston, Mr Philp said government departments are being asked to ""look for efficiencies wherever they can find them"". The efficiencies will ""stick to the targets"" of the 2021 Comprehensive Spending Review, Mr Philp said. Any savings will ""enable us to target spending on things that target growth,"" he said. Ministers have not decided whether benefits will rise in line with inflation in the autumn, he added. Mr Philp rejected calls for the OBR report on the mini-budget to be published, saying projections will be held until the 23 November to ensure they are done ""in a way that's organised and thoughtful""."
Volatility,US shares hit as virus surge revives economic fears,2024-09-25,2020-06-24,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-53172713,"Financial markets in the US dropped more than 2% on Wednesday as a rise in coronavirus cases raised the prospect of another round of lockdown measures. New York and two nearby states announced a quarantine on visitors from some US hotspots, while Europe was said to be considering a ban on US visitors. The new rules revived concerns about the path of America's fledgling economic recovery. Shares in travel, retail and energy firms were among the hardest hit. Cruise lines Carnival, Royal Caribbean and Norwegian tumbled more than 11%, while retailer Gap and shopping mall owner Simon Property Group fell more than 7%. Energy firms, already grappling with a drop in demand for oil, also slumped, with giants Exxon and Chevron both down more than 4%. Disney, which has seen its parks closed, cruises cancelled and filming disrupted due to the pandemic, tumbled 3.9%.   The firm is preparing to re-open all of its parks by mid-July, including its properties in Florida and California. But a labour union representing about 17,000 Disney workers has called for a protest in California, warning that returning to work is not yet safe. In Florida, one of the virus hotspots, more than 7,000 people have signed an online petition surging the company and local officials to reconsider the re-opening plans. ""It is clear that theme parks - a non-essential business - should not be planning to operate until the cases have gone down again,"" the petition says. On Sunday, the new daily coronavirus cases reported in Florida were quadruple the amount reported when the state began reopening on 4 May.  Top health advisor Dr Anthony Fauci said many US states including Florida are seeing a ""disturbing surge"" in cases on Tuesday.  Earlier, European markets also closed lower, with London's FTSE 100 down about 3%, while indexes in Germany and France posted similar declines. The falls came as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said the global economy would shrink 4.9% this year, substantially worse than the 3% it forecast as recently as April. The organisation said it expected US output to contract 8% - 2 percentage points worse than it predicted in April - while the UK would shrink roughly 10%. The gloomy outlook diverges with the optimism seen in financial markets in recent months, which has propelled the tech-heavy Nasdaq index to new highs and left the S&P 500 and Dow less than 15% lower than their February records. On Wednesday, the Dow dropped 709 points or 2.7% to close at 25,447. The S&P 500 fell 2.5% or 80.8 points, to close at 3,050.4 and the Nasdaq fell 2.1% or 222.2 points to close at 9,909.1. Sharp swings in share prices will remain common until questions about how to handle the virus are resolved, Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at US Bank Wealth Management, recently wrote in a note. ""The path toward normalcy will require more time and is subject to much uncertainty,"" he wrote.  ""We expect volatility to remain elevated from historical levels until coronavirus treatment and prevention solutions become available, presumably in early 2021."""
Volatility,NI public told to wear masks in shops,2024-09-25,2020-08-06,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-53668619,"Wearing masks in shops and other enclosed public spaces will be compulsory from Monday, Northern Ireland's first minister has said. Arlene Foster added indoor pubs which do not serve food will not be allowed to reopen on Monday, as planned. Ministers have been discussing the health minister's proposal to bring forward the original review date. Meanwhile, all schools will reopen full-time to all pupils from the start of term, the education minister said. It was also announced on Thursday that theatres and concert halls will allow audiences to return from 1 September.   Health Minister Robin Swann said earlier he was concerned about mixed messaging from the executive. The NI Executive has said it would base its lockdown-easing decisions on rate of the spread of the virus in the community. That R-number (the average number of people an infected person passes Covid-19 on to after contracting the disease) is now estimated to be between 0.8 - 1.8, and infections have risen three-fold since early July, said the health department earlier. Internationally viewed as an important measure in tracking the spread of the virus, the goal is to keep R below one. Confirming that face coverings would be mandatory from Monday, First Minister Arlene Foster said: ""It's really about trying to give confidence to people who feel vulnerable and maybe have been shielding. ""We're asking the public of Northern Ireland to work again with us around all of these issues and to listen to what we're asking them to do."" She added: ""If people get to the position where we're issuing fixed penalty tickets then we will have failed in telling people why it is important to do this."" Asked if there was a ""trade-off"" between keeping alcohol-only pubs closed and the plan to fully reopen schools, Mrs Foster said: ""I make no apology for the fact that we're prioritising schools, I think it's important for our young people that we get them back into schools."" The decisions come days after the Irish government decided to push back its reopening date for pubs to 31 August at the earliest.  At present, pubs and hotel bars in Northern Ireland can only open fully if they serve food. Those that only sell alcohol are restricted to serving customers outdoors.  The NI Executive had been due to review the pubs policy on 20 August and could have then made it law; Mrs Foster said the opening date for pubs would be pushed back to the start of September. It is understood soft play areas that were due to reopen on Friday 7 August have also had their date postponed.  Colin Neill of Hospitality Ulster said the decision on pubs was ""a catastrophic blow"" that ""removes the right to earn a living for people who work in our traditional pubs"". ""This will result in business failures and job losses immediately,"" he said. ""This decision now comes with a moral responsibility of the Northern Ireland Executive to step in and put in an emergency funding package to help save these jobs and save these businesses. ""We respect totally that the health of the nation comes first, but we have to protect livelihoods, we have to protect small businesses who, once lost, will never be back."" The Commissioner for Older People for Northern Ireland, Eddie Lynch, has said that the current level of mask wearing by the public is causing ""great concern among older people"" and is preventing many of them emerging from lockdown. The shielding period for vulnerable people ended on 31 July in Northern Ireland. A public information campaign encouraging the take-up of face coverings is due to begin later this week. In a statement on Thursday, the Department for Communities said theatres and and concert halls can reopen from 8 August, to allow staff to prepare ahead of 1 September, when audience will be allowed to return.  A manual has been published by the Arts Council on the safe reopening of concert venues. ""Covid-19 has had a devastating impact on all those who work in the creative industries,"" said Communities Minister Carál Ní Chuilín.  ""It is hoped that some venues can return to hosting live performances at the beginning of September, although we remain mindful of the ongoing challenges we face in dealing with the restrictions of Covid-19,"" she said.   ""The final decision to reopen will be dependent upon the safety of our theatre staff and the public."" The health department said that when community transmission of the virus was very low, the R number ""will show a high degree of volatility and be heavily influenced by small local clusters"". It added that the number of positive tests per day was ""likely to be a more important parameter"" in determining public health policy decisions. On Thursday, 43 new confirmed cases of Covid-19 were confirmed, bringing the total number of confirmed positive cases in Northern Ireland to 6,049.   Twenty-three clusters have been identified in Northern Ireland since contact tracing began in last May.   Nine clusters have had five or more cases associated with them.  Fourteen across Northern Ireland have had fewer than five people. Smaller clusters may be associated with a larger cluster - for example, a common geographic location or common social setting.   Five have been identified in the past week, with 35 cases involved and 239 close contacts.   Clusters are defined as two or more cases among individuals associated by a key setting - a workplace, retail or hospitality premises, domestic gatherings and sporting settings - with illness onset dates within a 14 day period.   In the Republic of Ireland, the Department of Health has been notified of five additional Covid-linked deaths and 69 new cases. However, Acting Chief Medical Officer Dr Ronan Glynn said four of the deaths are late notifications, relating to April and June. "
Volatility,Retail shares drag down FTSE 100,2024-09-25,2017-11-01,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-41829874,"Shares in Next fell 9.1% in Wednesday trade after the fashion retailer issued a cautious trading update. Next said third-quarter trading had been ""extremely volatile"", adding that this volatility made it hard to determine any underlying sales trend. Online sales growth at Next's Directory business continued to offset falling sales on the High Street, with sales up 1.3% overall in the quarter. Overall, the benchmark FTSE 100 index fell 5.12 points to close at 7,487.96. Shares in rival retailers were also hit by Next's update, with M&S down 4.5%. Primark owner Associated British Foods dropped 2.1%, while Debenhams fell 4%. Away from the retail sector, shares in Standard Chartered bank dropped 6% after its third quarter revenue growth of 4% fell short of expectations.  Paddy Power Betfair was the biggest riser in the index, climbing 4.5%, after it reported higher third-quarter revenues and made a small increase to its full-year earnings forecast. Revenues in the three months to 30 September rose 9% to £440m, and it now expects underlying earnings to be between £450m and £465m. On the currency markets, the pound was 0.16% down against the dollar at $1.3262, but was 0.05% higher against the euro at €1.1411."
Volatility,The storms battering oil and gas,2024-09-25,2020-05-03,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-52523905,"For the oil and gas sector in Scotland, coronavirus is merely one part of its current nightmare.  It's been the catalyst that has brought upon it a confluence of massive challenges around maturing assets and structural change, pressure over climate change, and geo-politics. This week, we learned from a survey by Oil and Gas UK - the representative body for the industry, which is also one of the more reliable sources of data about it - that up to 30,000 jobs are at risk in the UK sector. That's a very rough figure. It could be significantly worse, but it feels unlikely to be much less serious than that.  And the job numbers are a measure - a distillation, if you like - of the impact from numerous other changes coming down the pipeline. The UK industry is at the mercy of the oil price, over which it has no control. It is being battered by geopolitical rivalries between Saudis and Russia. With Asian demand for oil being hit hard by China's shut-down, their 6 March failure to do a deal on cutting supply sent the price of Brent crude oil barrelling downwards. That was as it was as it became clear that Europe and North America would also face a shutdown and sudden stop to much economic activity, including the grounding of entire airlines and traffic being cleared off roads. With supply far outstripping demand, the excess has to be stored somewhere.  That capacity is getting close to the brim.  By last week, around 80 ocean-going supertankers were being used for storage, some in the Firth of Forth.  It was the storage shortage that led to the price of the North American benchmark - West Texas Intermediate - turning negative in April, as contracts closed for May delivery. Where traders had failed to secure the rights to the diminishing amount of storage available, notably at the delivery point of American oil in Cushing, Oklahoma, they had to pay others to take oil off their hands. The geopolitics goes on: Saudi and Russia tussling for control and share of markets, others such as Venezuela hit exceptionally hard by reduced revenue, and President Trump... well, who knows what he's trying to do? He wants others to push the price back up, to help US producers, and US lenders who are exposed to loans turning sour in Texas and the Dakotas. Yet the president won't want to see the effect of increased fuel prices on his core voters come November, when they're already struggling with the economic impact of shutdown. More than 30 million Americans having registered as unemployed in the past few weeks. The low oil price, where far less tax is paid on car fuel than in Europe, is like a giant tax cut for American drivers. Low fuel prices also behave like a fiscal stimulus for airlines - at least those that haven't hedged on the expectation that prices would be much higher. With some US states beginning to relax the grip of lockdown, and some European countries too, the oil market picked up a bit last week. America's WTI benchmark has begun the new week down a further 8%, to $18, and at risk of another collapse as contracts close, in two weeks, for June delivery. Meanwhile, with less of a bottleneck on storage, Brent crude - used by the rest of the world's market as the benchmark - is down 3% with the start of a new week's trading, to below $26, having recently reached an 18-year low below $18. We talk a lot about the oil price, but much less about gas. And this week's Oil and Gas UK report had some interesting reflections on what has been happening to it, at least as it affects the industry and market in Britain.  Gas is less of a global market. Most of it gets from wellhead to central heating boiler and kitchen hob by pipeline, so the market has been determined by supply, demand and constraints on continental pipeline networks. That's changing though. At the start of last year, a therm of North Sea gas was wholesaling at 60 pence. That's for one day ahead, which is a measure of volatility as well as value. Most of the gas we use has been bought well in advance. In the first quarter of this year, the day-ahead price averaged 25 pence. On April 21, it bottomed out at 10.4 pence. That's not because of OPEC or Russia. Demand is down. We're more fuel efficient, with buildings better insulated. We had a mild winter so there was less need for heating.  Britain's total demand for gas fell over the past decade by 22%. Gas is being replaced by renewable sources in generating our electricity. In the past four years, Britain's use of gas in power stations has fallen 10%. Last year alone, use of gas in Britain was down 3.9%. Slightly more than half of it came from UK gas-producing fields, which were also exporting to Ireland and Belgium. These falls were before the lockdown. In the past few weeks, industrial demand for gas dropped 16%, Our use of electricity dropped by 15% - mainly in workplaces, while home use has risen, for home entertainment and as people work from home.  The other big change is in supply. There are more pipelines bringing gas from Norway, and a lot more liquified natural gas (LNG) is being shipped here, from the Persian and Mexican gulfs.  Last year, saw LNG imports more than double, accounting for 39% of Britain's imported gas. That competition drives the price down as well. So with prices down, what have we learned from Oil and Gas UK about the state of the industry, beyond those jobs at risk? It reckons this year could see companies going cash negative for the third time in 40 years. The average barrel of oil or its gaseous equivalent can be produced from UK waters for $15.20.  That's the result of harsh cost-cutting from free-spending days in the 2010-14 offshore investment boom, which led to production costs averaging above $30 per barrel. (That doesn't include exploration and development costs.) So the UK industry is in a leaner, fitter state than when the oil price last plunged.  With Brent crude ending last week at $26, producers can still break even. But that's the average. Some fields, and particularly the older ones, are more expensive, at up to $64 per barrel for production costs alone. So production costs are being squeezed, where there's further room to do so, and that usually means bearing down on supplier contracts. Some production levels will be cut back too. More significant is the slashing at investment plans while holding back on committing to new ones. Every day or two, it seems, another company reports cutbacks by the hundreds of millions of dollars.  This week, it was EnQuest and Ithaca Energy - two of the bigger producers in the North Sea these days, having bought a lot of assets from more familiar energy brands Shell and Chevron. Rystad Energy consultancy reckons the global capital cutback is around $100bn.  The survey by Oil and Gas UK suggests more than half of companies will more than halve their capital expenditure plans.   They were already expected to fall this year by 20 to 30% from the recent average, to reach the $4bn to $4.5bn range. They could end up a long way below that because of the low price, perhaps to the lowest level since the early 1970s, when the industry was getting under way. That directly affects those in the supply chain, who provide rigs and drilling equipment, engineering, data services, shipping, offshore catering, and so on. A lot of these companies are important exporters, and face similar cutbacks overseas to the ones in Scotland. It is those supply companies that are the focus of attention for industry calls for a special sector deal to weather the current economic tempest, pumping in government funds to keep them from collapse, and perhaps even accepting that government funds will be heading into the equivalent of a ""bad bank"" carrying bad loans. There are plenty people who will be outraged at the industry wanting more fiscal support, when it has been highly profitable in the past, and continues to provide the feedstock for climate changing emissions. The industry response is that these same engineering companies are among Britain's best hope for a transition to a net zero carbon economy - with carbon capture and storage back on the agenda after several false starts, and at the next frontier of making hydrogen as an energy source both safe and financially viable. The result of expenditure cuts now is lower oil and gas production in future. The lead time from capital expenditure to production varies, but it's measured across several years.  That investment boom beginning ten years ago opened up new fields, some of the biggest to the west of Shetland. Since then, 40 fields have come on stream, mostly in Scottish waters, and Oil and Gas UK tells us that these pumped more than a third of the UK total production last year. So rather than rely on old fields continuing to produce, at a rising cost per barrel, the industry would prefer to develop new, larger, more efficient fields - if that's financially viable.  At current prices, with recent volatility, few in UK waters will meet that financial test. Drilling activity has been low for years. It's now getting lower.  Exploration drilling has all but halted this year. Development projects, which are drilled to extend extraction within an existing field, dropped from 21 wells in April last year to only three last month, and the same expected this month. If there aren't more wells like that being sunk, then production is going to fall faster than expected. And with profits squeezed hard, there is little prospect of significant tax take - either for HM Revenue and Customs, or those surveying the financial outlook for an independent Scotland."
Volatility,Bitcoin futures trading begins in Chicago,2024-09-25,2017-12-10,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42304657,"Bitcoin has begun trading on a major exchange for the first time.  The digital currency launched on the CBOE futures exchange in Chicago at 23:00 GMT Sunday, allowing investors to bet on whether Bitcoin prices will rise or fall.  Its value had surged in the run-up to its futures debut, which saw it rise another 17% to above $18,000. Bitcoin's introduction to the CBOE has been seen by some as a step towards legitimising the currency. The move is expected to be followed next week by a listing on the rival Chicago Mercantile Exchange. CBOE trading saw the Bitcoin futures contract expiring in January start at $15,000 before rising to above $18,000. The contract is based on the price of Bitcoin as quoted on the Gemini exchange. The Gemini exchange was set up by the Winklevoss twins, who were early fans of the crypto-currency and who have been called the first Bitcoin billionaires. A CBOE insider said its start was low key, with ""no champagne"". However, CBOE tweeted to warn that its website was running slowly and could be temporarily unavailable. Anticipation of the first mainstream listings have helped the controversial currency soar past $10,000 and then over $17,000 on Thursday before retreating. The price of Bitcoin stood at about $16,600 on Monday, according to Coindesk.com. Futures are contracts that allow investors to bet on the price of something at a future date.  Investors can now bet on Bitcoin rising or falling in price without actually owning them. Futures are typically based on the price of a real commodity - such as oil. One of the controversial aspects of Bitcoin is that some do not see it as a ""thing"". Although it is called a currency, it can be argued it is an asset, or commodity, without any actual use or real assessable value.  Nick Colas, of Data Trek research, said the futures listings gave Bitcoin ""legitimacy - it recognises that it's an asset you can trade"". Chris Ralph, chief investment officer at St James's Place told the BBC's Today programme that he remained cautious about the currency. ""I refuse to use the word legitimate, but it's probably moved out of the shadows into the open,"" he said. ""But what I think it means is more people in the conventional investment banking market will take a look at Bitcoin. ""It has been described as the asset class of 2017 but when we went into the year no one would have called it an asset class."" Bitcoin futures will make it easier for more investors to buy the crypto-currency, by removing the need for them to set up a special digital Bitcoin wallet. Sceptics argue that the CBOE futures will simply draw more naïve investors into perpetuating a bubble in a financial asset that Nobel economist Joseph Stiglitz has accused of having no intrinsic value beyond supporting money laundering and tax avoidance. And there is something else that anyone placing big bets on the futures market may want to think about. The eventual payout on their futures contract depends on the auction price at the separate Gemini exchange of the Winklevoss brothers. Are they confident that the auction price cannot be manipulated, in the same way that Libor and regular currency derivatives have been in the recent past? The CBOE and CME launches were made possible following approval by the US Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). However, the regulator has warned investors about the ""potentially high level of volatility and risk in trading these contracts"".  The Futures Industry Association, which includes some of the world's biggest derivatives brokerages, has criticised the CFTC's decision, arguing that insufficient attention has been paid to the risks involved. Bitcoin is not regulated by any country's central bank and has no universally recognised exchange rate. CBOE rules suspend trading if Bitcoin prices rise or fall by 10%, in an attempt to reduce wild fluctuations. They kicked in twice in this first session. ""We are committed to continue to work closely with the CFTC to monitor trading and foster the growth of a transparent, liquid and fair Bitcoin futures market,"" CBOE said."
Volatility,Bank boosts plan to reassure investors,2024-09-25,2022-10-10,By Nick Edser,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63198341,"The Bank of England has announced new measures aimed at ensuring an ""orderly end"" to its emergency bond buying scheme which was introduced to stop a collapse of some pension funds.  The Bank will increase the amount of bonds it can buy in the final week of the scheme, which ends on Friday.  It will also introduce extra support to ease future strains on pension funds.  The Bank initially stepped in after the government's mini-budget sparked turmoil on financial markets. With the deadline for the Bank's bond-buying programme fast approaching, there have been concerns volatility would return once the scheme ends. However, Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said the Bank was taking the approach of ""talking loudly and carrying a big stick"" in its attempt to calm concerns, He said the measures are ""designed to reassure pension managers - and pension holders - that help will be provided"".  He added that the Bank's announcement reaffirms that the bond purchases were a short-term measure and ""it remains committed to withdrawing monetary stimulus and tightening monetary policy as it fights inflation"". The mini-budget - which was announced on 23 September - pledged £45bn of tax cuts as part of a plan to boost economic growth, but the level of government borrowing required shocked investors who questioned the sustainability of the public finances. In the aftermath of the statement, the pound hit a record low and investors demanded a much higher return for investing in government bonds, causing some to drop sharply in value. Certain types of funds in the pension industry, which invest in bonds, were forced to start selling, sparking fears of a fresh market downturn. On 28 September, the Bank stepped in to buy government bonds saying its decision was driven by concern over ""a material risk to UK financial stability"". It said it would buy up to £65bn bonds, with a limit of £5bn a day. So far, the Bank has bought only around £5bn bonds in total under the programme and in its latest announcement it said stood ready to increase the size of its daily purchases. On Monday, it doubled the limit to £10bn. This intervention is about a transition off the Bank of England emergency support offered in government bond markets, in the aftermath of the mini-budget. The Bank of England is trying to leave no stone unturned in making sure the withdrawal of this support occurs in an orderly manner. But the Bank is also committing to the timetable to phase out the support this week. Some in the markets had anticipated it would need to be extended. The Bank is demonstrating that this intervention is not intended to limit the rise in government costs, but instead was a temporary and targeted effort aimed at maintaining financial stability. This is the message heard in markets on Monday, with effective borrowing costs, or yields, on government debt on the rise again. These rates were over 4.5% for borrowing over 30 years and five years. The big picture is this: if the Treasury wants to bring down now rising government borrowing costs - which have an effect on mortgages and business lending too - it is up to it to present a credible set of tax and spending plans and independent forecasts, which are now promised for the end of October. The forecasts and the plan will now feed into the Bank of England's interest rate decision in early November. The Bank of England's intervention was a temporary bridge over a specific crisis. The solution here is for the government. The government borrows money to fund its spending plans by selling bonds, or ""gilts"", to investors such as pension funds and big banks on international markets. But a collapse in the price of those bonds in the aftermath of the mini-budget was forcing some funds to rush to sell bonds further forcing down the price. If that process had continued, there was a risk that those pension funds could have got to a position where they could not pay their debts. In its latest statement, the Bank said there had been ""substantial progress"" in addressing the financial problems facing these funds, which had faced the prospect of having to make forced sales of £50bn of bonds. As well as increasing the daily limit on bond purchases this week, the Bank also announced a further measure to help the funds affected by the recent market volatility. Under the measure, these funds will be able to use a wider range of assets - such as company bonds - to access money to help meet any short-term financial demands. It is hoped this means these funds will not be forced to sell government bonds to raise cash, which was what they had to do in the immediate aftermath of the mini-budget. This measure will continue after the emergency bond-buying programme has finished. Before the mini-budget, the yield on government borrowing over a 30-year period stood at about 3.7%. The yield is effectively the interest rate. After the mini-budget it jumped to 5.1% until the Bank's intervention pushed the rate back down. However, in recent days it has crept back up again to around 4.5%."
Volatility,UK trading platform IG stops new GameStop trades,2024-09-25,2021-01-30,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-55871381,"One of the UK's biggest financial trading platforms, IG, has stopped any new trades in GameStop and theatre chain AMC when markets open on Monday. US video games retailer GameStop is the focus of a trading war between amateurs and Wall Street pros. Both GameStop and AMC Entertainment have seen their share prices boom as amateur investors, fuelled by chat on social media, bought their shares. In a statement IG said the restrictions will be reviewed regularly. Other popular stock market trading apps also temporarily halted dealings in GameStop on Thursday, after its shares soared as much as 700% in the past week.  AMC Entertainment and Blackberry, which have also seen huge trading activity, were among the other companies hit by the trading restrictions. But the move left investors outraged, accusing the trading platforms of working on behalf of traditional Wall Street investors who were losing out. Several platforms then rowed back on their stance. In a statement, IG said: ""Due to the recent extreme volatility, and in order to prioritise the service we give our existing clients, we are not allowing any new positions to be opened on the US stocks GameStop and AMC Entertainment. ""These restrictions apply to all IG accounts, and will be reviewed regularly. You will still be able to close any open positions that you have in these stocks. Any orders that you have already placed on these two stocks will remain."" GameStop is a struggling US High Street shop that sells games, consoles and other electronics. Lots of big investment firms, such as hedge funds, had bet on GameStop to lose a lot of value, meaning they borrowed shares in the company and then sold them, with a promise to buy them back at a later date. This is called ""short selling"" or ""shorting"" and the idea is to make money as the share price falls. GameStop - which saw heavy losses last year and was described as ""failing"" by one big investor - is the most shorted stock on Wall Street. But huge numbers of independent amateur traders on social media, including Reddit, swapped tips and bought shares in GameStop. The demand raised its share price massively, leading to losses for the Wall Street traders. And the idea has caught on globally, fuelling activity in stocks traded in other parts of the world, including the UK, Brazil and Malaysia. The strategy has also been deployed on behalf of other firms, such as struggling theatre chain AMC Entertainment, owner of Odeon Cinemas. Publisher Pearson and cinema operator Cineworld have also been the focus of social media discussion, although the share price movements were minimal compared with the GameStop surge. Earlier this week, watchdogs in the US and UK said they were monitoring activity and potential lawbreaking, and warned traders they risked facing huge losses. In a statement on Friday, the UK's Financial Conduct Authority said: ""The FCA is aware of the situation and continues to closely monitor trading in UK markets. UK investors should take care when trading shares in highly volatile market conditions that they fully understand the risks they are taking. This applies to UK investors trading both US and UK stocks. ""Firms and individuals should also ensure they are familiar with, and abiding by, all regulations including the market abuse and short selling regimes in the jurisdiction they are trading in."""
Volatility,How cow poo is powering crypto mining,2024-09-25,2021-06-09,By Chris Vallance,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-57199405,"At Philip Hughes farm, near the Berwyn mountain range, not far from the Snowdonia National Park, in Denbighshire, cattle chew the lush valley pastures and flocks of sheep clothe the hills. In a green shipping container next to a large domed tank, a very different kind of farm also thrives in this idyllic landscape - a cryptocurrency farm. Philip Hughes's family have farmed the land for generations - but now he is turning his hand to mining, using powerful computers powered by renewable energy to generate new cryptocurrency. And that energy is derived, as Philip puts it, from ""cow muck"".  A big six-cylinder engine running at 500rpm turns methane given off by decomposing cow manure into electricity.  The process is called anaerobic digestion.  In the absence of oxygen, microbes break down the manure and produce methane, which can be combusted to produce heat and electricity, instead of entering the atmosphere where it would act as a powerful greenhouse gas.  What's left over can be used as fertiliser. About two-thirds of the electricity generated by the anaerobic digester helps power the farm and the farm's caravan park - but the remainder powers mining rigs, specialist computers about the size of a suitcase.  They are working on complex computations that serve to verify transactions and in return are rewarded with new cryptocurrency - a process that can consume large amounts of energy. Presently, they are mining Ethereum.   The income has been good but ""it does very much depend on what day you ask that question"", Philip says, with a nod to the notorious volatility of this digital product.  The value of Ethereum has fallen from over $4,000 (£2,800) in May to about $2,400 at the time of writing. Philip has also started leasing out his renewable energy.  The rigs powered by the digester are a mixture of those he owns and others belonging to third parties. At a cost of about £18,000, each rig is stuffed with ""lots of very powerful computer-graphics cards"", according to supplier Josh Riddett, who runs Easy Crypto Hunter, in Manchester.    And while the energy consumption of Ethereum mining is high, it is significantly less than mining Bitcoin and may yet be reduced further. Josh has been pitching cryptocurrency mining to small-scale renewable electricity generators for some time - he says his equipment is in 42 sites covering solar, hydro and wind-powered generators in addition to anaerobic digestion.  But some small-scale hydro projects are wary because they worry about the environmental impact of the cryptocurrencies.   And others doubt cryptocurrencies will be valuable for long enough or consistently enough to repay the considerable capital investment hydropower requires. Out of the British Hydropower Association's 290 members, the association's CEO Simon Hamlyn, knows of just two who are trying out crypto mining.  One has purchased a number of rigs to install at sites in Northern Ireland. But the other fell victim to a heist, when masked thieves crossed fields to break into the powerhouse and steal the rigs. Previously, the main mechanism for developing renewable-energy schemes was the feed-in-tariff, which paid renewable generators for the electricity they fed into the grid. The tariff started in 2011 and a boom in renewables followed - but the amount it pays has declined and it closed to new generators in 2019.  ""We're not going to be able to move to green energy unless the government revitalises the subsidy, or we start looking at alternatives,"" Josh says.  But renewable energy used to mine cryptocurrency cannot be used for other purposes, such as powering electric cars or heating homes.  If cryptocurrency is as socially valuable as any of those things, this might not matter - but for critics such as financial economist Alex de Vries, who writes the Digiconomist blog, it is a waste of green energy. ""The utility these systems can have is inherently extremely limited,"" he says.  ""If you look at Bitcoin, it can only process seven transactions per second at most - that's its maximum capacity.  ""You have to consider that a payments provider like Visa can do 65,000 transactions per second if needed.""  The decline of heavy industry has left some parts of the US with a surplus of hydroelectric power and the resulting cheap electricity has attracted cryptocurrency miners.  But communities that have experienced a ""gold rush"" of crypto miners have found it a mixed blessing, pushing up electricity prices.  And some, such as Plattsburg, have temporarily banned crypto mining.  Alex worries also about the limited lifespan of mining equipment, which he says can rapidly become obsolete, creating an e-waste problem. And rather than switching to renewables, many say it would be better to make cryptocurrencies more efficient - or stop using them altogether. In the UK, the Anaerobic Digestion and Bioresources Association says only a ""small handful of plants"" are exploring crypto mining.  And Philip is very aware his cryptocurrency business is based upon producing an asset whose value can change dramatically, sometimes in response to a single remark by Elon Musk or Donald Trump. If the market collapses, he says, he will put the computing power of the rigs to other uses. But some seem more speculative than others, such as setting the boxes of graphic cards to work rendering computer animation for film-makers such as Disney. His venture into crypto has sparked interest, though. Other farmers interested in the project have called him, Philip says. And it is ""a lot easier to run a computer, than a herd of cows or a flock of sheep"". "
Volatility,University facing possible £11m energy bill rise,2024-09-25,2023-01-18,By Julia Causton,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-bristol-64292532,"A university says it could be facing an energy bill rise of more than £11m. Steve West, vice chancellor of the University of the West of England (UWE) in Bristol, said costs might be as high as £18m in 2023-2024. He said the price increase would not be passed on to students, despite the impact on the university's budget. ""We're looking at how we can save energy, save costs, but also we're having to look hard about how and where we invest going forward,"" Mr West said. UWE's energy bill for the 2021-2022 academic year was £6.5m, while in 2022-23 it was £10.5million, he added. ""Many universities forward purchase [energy], so we forward purchase two years ahead, and that gives us some security. ""But at the moment the market is so volatile, we're going to see a significant increase. We don't quite know how much and that's a big problem for us,"" said Mr West. He warned the rising energy prices could ""impact on our capital investments going forward"". ""At the moment we're prioritising all of the things we can do to reduce our energy to net zero carbon emissions for the university itself,"" added Mr West. Meanwhile, the University of Bath told the BBC it generated about 10 per cent of its electricity on campus through the use of renewables and mini-power stations. The University of Gloucestershire said its energy rate was fixed every six months so, although it was likely to face significantly higher prices later in the year, it was currently protected from market volatility. While its energy bills have increased ""significantly"", the University of Bristol said they remained a small part of its overall expenditure. It said its priority was to help students who were struggling, via hardship funding. Follow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. Send your story ideas to: bristol@bbc.co.uk"
Volatility,How Gen Z is hooked on cryptocurrency and NFTs,2024-09-25,2022-05-17,By Mariko Oi,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60566575,"The lure of making a quick buck has always attracted young people to invest in risky assets. For Generation Z, it is the volatility - and the decentralised nature - of digital assets such as cryptocurrency and NFTs which appeals. But they are unregulated, meaning there is little investor protection. ""All my friends were talking about [cryptocurrency] so one day I just decided why not just jump in and see if I can make some money,"" says 20-year-old Paxton See Tow. All he needed was his phone and trading thousands of dollars' worth of assets was only a click away.  Generation Z - also known as Zoomers - are the age group born between the mid-1990s to early-2000s. They grew up online, playing games and meeting friends virtually, so the transition is natural. Cryptocurrencies are digital currencies while a ""non-fungible token"" (NFT) is a way of owning an original digital image, touted as the digital answer to collectables. Just over a year ago, Paxton bought S$1,000 ($743; £739) worth of Bitcoin - one of the most popular cryptocurrencies - which gave him a 10% profit straight away. He decided to quadruple his portfolio. But then the price fell.  ""There's always the saying 'buy low, sell high' but I did the complete opposite. I let my emotions get the better of me,"" he says. He had lost a thousand dollars, on top of all the money he had invested, before he could pull his money out and re-strategise. For another, older trader, Kelvin Kong, the loss was much bigger. After making six figures in 2017, he lost more than half a million dollars the following year. ""I lost everything,"" he says. ""I thought I was the king of trading and my head got really big so I thought nothing could bring me down and I kept buying,"" he says.  In the end, he only had a few hundred dollars left in his bank account.  ""I think I almost went into depression. I had suicidal thoughts."" The boom in crypto and NFTs trading among young people worries him. ""A lot of them will lose money at the end of the day,"" he adds. But cautionary tales of people losing huge amounts of money don't seem to deter young traders.  For many, the first taste of digital assets are through ""play-to-earn games"" which reward players with NFTs and cryptocurrencies that can then be used within the game itself, or traded for cash. ""Every kid wants to make money playing games,"" says a 23-year-old trader in Malaysia who goes by the name of YellowPanther. ""That's the dream of my generation."" A month after he started trading NFTs last August, he decided to quit his job as a marketing executive to trade them full time. ""The day job took a long time - eight to nine hours a day - and the pay was quite low. I saw a big opportunity in the [NFT] space and I took the leap of faith,"" he says. YellowPanther now works with 29-year-old Resh Chandran, who offers training in conventional stocks, cryptocurrency and NFT trading in Singapore. Using Axie Infinity, one of the most popular ""play-to-earn games"", Mr Chandran introduces investors to mostly Filipino gamers who play on their behalf for a fee. But he warns the space is a ""wild wild west"".  The pandemic has only accelerated this growing trend of young people trading crypto and NFTs.  ""There was an extreme level of volatility in the marketplace so when you have volatility you also have opportunity in the market,"" says Lily Fang, a professor of finance at INSEAD business school. ""Young people were at home and it's almost a gamification of trading. All of these factors created a perfect condition for this to take off.""  For many young wannabe traders, advice is readily available on platforms such as YouTube, Twitter and Reddit. Brian Jung, 23, boasts one million YouTube followers but compared to other crypto influencers, he is known to talk more cautiously about the risks. ""I really have to make sure I'm careful about what I say to my audience because the last thing I want is for people to get hurt from these types of videos,"" he tells the BBC.  Brian's family emigrated from South Korea to the US and he believes his background affects how he invests and talks about money. ""Our family always struggled financially so I always have this frugal mindset,"" he says. ""My mum still works at the US Post Office and my dad works in a warehouse so I know one hour of their time is still equivalent to dollar value. I see what that is worth, regardless of how much income that I'm getting right now."" Gaining financial freedom is also what attracted 22-year-old Jowella Lim - a rare female trader - to the crypto world. But as well as the opportunities to make money, Jowella enjoys being at the forefront of this new technology.  As governments around the world look to regulate the industry, she believes they will help legitimise crypto and NFTs. ""Regulators have to eventually compromise and realise that this is a tech they cannot ignore, especially when it's constantly penetrating this society,"" she adds. Aside from financial losses, another big danger is addiction. ""The crypto market never sleeps so people really literally get sucked into it,"" says Mr Chandran.  Andy Leach, from addictions clinic Visions by Promises in Singapore, says he has seen a jump in young - particularly male - clients getting addicted to the thrill of trading crypto and NFTs.  ""You have the ability to watch Bitcoin going up and down and basically this process, this rollercoaster ride, the highs, the lows, it's available on your phone 24/7,"" he says. Despite losing money in the crypto market in the past, both Paxton and Kelvin are back trading after studying it more closely. I asked Kelvin if he thinks he may be addicted. ""You can put it that way,"" he smiles. ""But I would call it passion."""
Volatility,Tech Tent: Apple's security under scrutiny,2024-09-25,2017-12-01,By Rory Cellan-Jones,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-42195356,"Will Apple's gold-plated reputation with consumers be dented by an embarrassing security foul-up? Also on the podcast this week: is Bitcoin really using more energy than Ireland? And what kind of qualities do you need to succeed as a professional e-sports player? We try to answer those questions on this week's Tech Tent. For a long time, Apple has boasted - with some justification - that it has an excellent record of keeping its devices safe from intruders.  In any case, with PCs having the lion's share of the computer market, hackers and security researchers used to spend little time hunting down vulnerabilities in Macs. But on Tuesday a Turkish software developer tweeted this: ""Dear @AppleSupport, we noticed a *HUGE* security issue at MacOS High Sierra. Anyone can login as 'root' with empty password after clicking on login button several times."" It sounded unlikely but it was true. What it meant was that anyone who got hold of an Apple computer running the latest operating system could get root access to the machine with very little trouble. ""Root access is a bit like having a master key to the building,"" Prof Angela Sasse, from University College London, tells Tech Tent. ""It's really bad news.""  She explains that it means an intruder could install new software, such as spyware, on your computer. And she is surprised that this issue was not spotted before High Sierra was released. ""Normally before release you would test that root access is adequately protected."" Apple moved quickly to release an update to patch this loophole in the operating system's defences. So will it suffer any long-term consequences in terms of a loss of consumer trust? Neil Mawston, from the tech consultancy Strategy Analytics, says Apple is a very clever company with a great brand.  But he has some concerns: ""We're seeing this gradual tick-tock of mis-steps in delivery.""  Recently, we have seen the delay in the launch of Apple's Homepod - and another, albeit much more minor, security issue.  ""If products are late or they have lots of flaws and that keeps on building up momentum, then that negative press coverage eventually catches up with them."" A decade ago a furious Steve Jobs would have roamed the Cupertino campus to find someone to eject from the building for such a serious error. Tim Cook's style is very much more measured, but do not be surprised if there is some movement in the upper ranks of Mac management in the coming months. It has been a dizzying week for anyone who takes an interest in the crypto-currency Bitcoin. It started 2017 worth just under $1,000 (£740) but this week it soared past the $10,000 mark. In the days that followed, the volatility we have come to expect from the Bitcoin market has become even more pronounced. In the space of three hours, its price dropped by more than $2,000, only to bounce back a few hours later. The debate over whether this is a speculative bubble or the future of money gets hotter by the moment. But so too do concerns over the amount of energy used in the process of mining Bitcoin and recording transactions. As banks of computers whir away, many of them in China, the electricity consumed as they solve increasingly complex mathematical problems gets ever greater. According to one study, Bitcoin is now using more energy each year than the whole of Ireland, and will soon surpass Morocco's energy use. This does not sound sustainable, but as long as the value of Bitcoin keeps rising, miners will not care about the electricity bills. And meanwhile the incentive to plant software on websites to hijack visitors' computers to help mine Bitcoin will only increase. Competitive video gaming or e-sports is a rapidly growing business. Market research firm Newzoo thinks this young industry will make nearly $700m in revenue this year. And it is not all about consoles - mobile gaming is increasingly popular. This weekend, London hosts the Clash Royale Crown World Championships, a global tournament entered by more than 27 million players, according to Supercell, the Finnish creators of the mobile game Clash Royale. Only a few of those will be professional e-sports players. This new breed can earn substantial sums, not only from tournaments but from sponsors, advertisers and from fans who watch them streaming their practice sessions on Twitch or YouTube and just send them money. So what does it take to make it as one of these new sports stars?  We hear from ElecTr1fy - yes, it is important to have an arresting name - who tells us his YouTube channel has added 40,000 subscribers and had generated 40 million views over the last month.  ""You need fast instincts  - every delay can cost you the game,"" he tells us. ""And you need to get into your opponent's head."" That message is reinforced by The Rum Ham, a gamescaster - another new profession - providing live commentary on e-sports. He says it is about making good decisions quickly.  ""They're making decisions where hundreds of thousands of dollars are on the line in a split second.  These players are doing mental maths, spatial awareness, predicting the outcomes of a combat before the troops are even on the field - all in a three-minute game play."" And the prize? Well the best players are making more than a million dollars a year. Time to put away the crossword, forget about the Sudoku and get down to some serious gaming. "
Volatility,Judicial review for Larne Lough gas storage plans,2024-09-25,2022-04-04,By Louise Cullen,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-60972141,"A legal challenge to plans for gas storage caverns under Larne Lough will proceed to judicial review.  The Department of Agriculture and Environment (DAERA) granted the project a marine construction licence in October 2021.   The campaign groups No Gas Caverns and Friends of the Earth requested leave to apply for a judicial review. The hearing is expected to take place later this year.   The department accepted there was a case to answer. The project would create seven gas storage caverns off the coast at Islandmagee, County Antrim, by carving out salt layers.   About half a billion cubic metres of natural gas would be stored, creating a 14-day buffer during periods of peak demand.   Long term, it is proposed to store hydrogen, as a product of surplus wind power generation.  Islandmagee Energy said the project would provide security of supply during peak demand for up to 14 days. Harland and Wolff, Islandmagee Energy's parent company, has said that with the current energy supply issues, ""everyone now understands just how important gas storage is to secure supply and protect against extreme volatility in gas and power prices in the UK"". It also said it would create 400 direct jobs.  Chief Executive John Wood also said in 2020 that it had completed a ""robust series of surveys and studies"", which had been sent to Stormont departments. It has also said that the caverns are ""a well-proven technique that represents the most environmentally friendly, safe and efficient method of storing large volumes of gas"". But campaigners say the discharge of extremely salty water, as a result of excavating the caverns, would threaten the local environment, undermine action on climate change and have a ""significant detrimental impact"" on sea life.   Because the grounds on which the application is based were accepted without a leave hearing, the case will now proceed to the substantive stage. The No Gas Caverns group and the director of Friends of the Earth NI welcomed the latest development.   A spokesperson for DAERA said: ""As this is an ongoing legal matter, we are not in a position to comment."""
Volatility,Call for pump price investigation,2024-09-25,2011-05-30,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-13593591,"Petrol prices reached record levels in April An alliance of European motoring organisations has written to the European Union calling for an investigation into the price of fuel. The call comes from the Federation Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) in a letter to the European Union.  The group represents 35 million European drivers, including members of the RAC and AA in the UK. The FIA said the way petrol prices are currently set was ""far from transparent"". A full tank of fuel for an average European car now costs around £10 more than it did a year ago.  The price of fuel in the UK reached record levels in April as the cost of Brent crude rose above $125 a barrel. Although the price of crude has fallen $10 since then, motoring groups say the wholesale price of petrol has not fallen as fast. The price of crude oil is only one factor affecting the petrol price. Oil is traded in dollars, so the exchange rate against the dollar has a big impact on prices. Taxes, transportation and refining costs also vary - impacting the cost of fuel at the pump.  But the FIA says the EU should investigate the way petrol prices are set for the European market.  Most European petrol prices are derived from the Rotterdam spot market where some cargoes of petrol and diesel are bought and sold. But the FIA is not sure that this market works effectively. ""A platform with such a small volume is doubted to be a representative indicator for the vast European market,"" said Werner Krauss, chairman of the FIA Eurocouncil. This video can not be played Brian Madderson of RMI Petrol calls for 'fair competition' The organisation also wants the EU to look into the role of speculators who invest in the oil market. Mr Krauss claimed the ""resulting volatility"" in petrol prices had a negative financial impact on consumers. The complaint is backed by the UK motoring organisation the AA, which is calling for an independent regulator to oversee the petrol market. ""No one is giving us any answer as to why petrol prices are so high,"" said AA public affairs spokesman Luke Bosdet. ""We need greater transparency so everyone can see we are paying a fair price for fuel,"" he added.  Retailers have said that prices do go down when the cost of petrol has fallen. One way for sellers to balance the changing price of fuel is to buy in advance. The UK's largest supermarket, Tesco, say they try to keep prices low and will sometimes buy fuel in advance to balance changes in price. But in a statement the retailer said it was difficult to predict when to buy. ""As everybody knows, it's very difficult to predict movements in crude oil prices, which can go down as well as up. So it's wrong to say that buying in advance is necessarily an advantage,"" Tesco said in a statement.

Volatility,Home asking prices see smallest February rise of £14,2024-09-25,2023-02-20,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-64703234,"The average asking price for a UK home rose by just £14 from January to February, according to property website Rightmove - the lowest increase for the month since its records began in 2001. The average asking price for a home is now £362,452, it said. Asking prices normally rise at the start of the year as sellers gear up for the spring selling season. However, price tags do fluctuate at other times in a year. For example in November and December, they decreased. Rightmove said higher mortgage rates and living costs were squeezing what people could afford. It follows months of falling house prices and predictions of further declines this year and next.  ""Many sellers are breaking with tradition and showing unseasonal initial pricing restraint,"" Tim Bannister, Rightmove's director of property science, said of the latest figures.  He added buyers were taking more time to ""find the right property at the right price"" and wanted ""greater realism on price"". Up until January house prices in the UK fell for five months in a row, according to building society Nationwide.  Meanwhile annual house price growth slowed to 1.1%, down from 2.8% in December. Rightmove said the rise in asking prices seen this February was lower than the growth of 0.6% recorded during the 2008 financial crisis. Part of the reason is higher mortgage rates, which have squeezed purchasing power. Rates have fallen from the 6.65% highs seen after Liz Truss's mini-budget in September but remain far above what they were a year ago. According to research firm Moneyfacts, average two-year and five-year fixed rate mortgages are still above 5%.  At the same time inflation - the rate at which prices rise - is near a 40-year high, putting pressure on household budgets.  Despite this, Rightmove said buyers were benefiting from ""more choice albeit with revised budgets to accommodate higher mortgage rates"". The company said the number of sales agreed was rebounding, but was still 11% down on 2019 levels. They had been down 30% during the aftermath of the mini-budget. And Tom Bill, head of UK residential research at estate agent Knight Frank, said the housing market had picked up a bit since Christmas.  ""Buyers and sellers switched off early for the holidays due to the volatility caused by the mini-budget but have come back surprisingly strongly in 2023,"" he said. Knight Frank expects house prices to fall by about 5% this year as household budgets come under pressure.  The Office for Budget Responsibility, the government's official forecaster, has predicted a 9% drop in prices through to Autumn 2024 before prices start to rise again."
Volatility,FTX founder Bankman-Fried denied bail in Bahamas,2024-09-25,2022-12-14,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-63967010,"Sam Bankman-Fried, founder of the failed cryptocurrency exchange FTX, has been denied bail by a judge in the Bahamas. US authorities charged Mr Bankman-Fried with ""one of the biggest financial frauds in US history"" on Tuesday. The ex-FTX boss built a ""house of cards on a foundation of deception,"" Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler said. Mr Bankman-Fried has indicated that he will fight extradition to the US. Bahamas Chief Magistrate JoyAnn Ferguson-Pratt denied the petition for his release on bail, citing a ""great"" risk of flight, and ordered that he be kept on remand at a correctional facility until 8 February. He was arrested in the Bahamas on Monday.  Last month, FTX filed for bankruptcy in the US, leaving many users unable to withdraw their funds. According to a court filing, FTX owed its 50 largest creditors almost $3.1bn (£2.5bn). Among the most serious allegations against Mr Bankman-Fried is that he used billions of dollars of customer funds to prop up his investment trading company, Alameda. It is unclear how much people who have funds in the exchange will get back at the end of bankruptcy proceedings - though many experts have warned it may be a small fraction of what they deposited. Mr Bankman-Fried faces eight criminal charges in the US, including wire fraud, money laundering and conspiracy to defraud. He also faces civil charges including misleading investors who put more than $1bn into the company. Officials have also accused him of violating campaign finance laws.  At a news conference on Tuesday, Damian Williams, the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York, described the fraud Mr Bankman-Fried is accused of as among the largest in US history.  Besides accusing Mr Bankman-Fried of defrauding lenders, investors and customers, Mr Williams alleged he had used ""tens of millions"" in ill-gotten gains for illegal campaign contributions to Democrats and Republicans alike.  ""All this dirty money was used in service of Bankman-Fried's desire to buy bipartisan influence and impact the direction of public policy in Washington,"" Mr Williams said.  In previous media interviews, the crypto tycoon has admitted to mistakes, but denied intent to defraud his customers. Mr Bankman-Fried also denied allegations he must have been aware that FTX's affiliated trading company, Alameda Research, was using FTX customer funds. He was once viewed as a young version of legendary US investor Warren Buffett. As recently as late October, he had a net worth estimated at more than $15bn (£12.1bn). Meanwhile, the firm's new chief executive, John Ray, told a US congressional committee that FTX's collapse appeared to be the result of it being controlled by a small group of ""grossly inexperienced, non-sophisticated individuals"". He said he had seen ""an utter lack of record-keeping - no internal controls whatsoever"". The FTX exchange allowed customers to trade normal money for cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. Cryptocurrencies are not currencies in the traditional sense, but are stored online and act more like investment vehicles or securities - often with a high degree of volatility. Their anonymity means they have been favoured for criminal activities such as drug dealing and ransomware attacks, but their supporters say there is huge potential for innovation - and independence from governments."
Volatility,Scottish prescription costs rise by 25%,2024-09-25,2018-07-24,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-44937793,"The cost of providing prescriptions has gone up by 25% in the last decade, with an ageing population and new drugs part of the reason. NHS figures show the total bill for 2017-18 was £1.3bn, which is 25.7% more expensive than 10 years ago. Paracetamol and aspirin are among the most commonly-prescribed drugs. In Glasgow, the average cost of prescriptions is about 8% higher than the Scottish average. The data, from the Information Services Division of NHS Scotland, said the overall cost amounted to £248.79 per person. In the NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde area, Scotland's largest health board, that figure rose to £271.30 per person, while NHS Orkney had the lowest average cost at £206.28 per person. Prescriptions have been free in Scotland since April 2011, a policy introduced by the SNP government. The figures showed 103.4 million items were dispensed on prescription in 2017-18 - an increase of more than a fifth over the last 10 years. Pregabalin, a drug used to treat epilepsy and chronic pain, had the highest total gross ingredient cost in 2017-18, at £36.38m. The most commonly-prescribed medication was omeprazole - used to treat indigestion, acid reflux, and stomach ulcers - with a total of 3.59 million prescriptions issued. Painkillers paracetamol and aspirin - both of which are available over the counter without a prescription - were the fourth and eighth most commonly-issued prescriptions, at 2.5 million and 2.01 million respectively. The report states that reasons for the increase in the number of prescriptions issued over the decade include; It also explains that there has been a shift from secondary to primary care for a number of high-cost medicines. The Scottish government said the figures had not been adjusted for inflation, but inflation would be a factor on the value of drugs in the global pharmaceuticals market. Scottish Conservative shadow health spokesman Miles Briggs has responded to the figures, saying he's concerned: ""With drugs such as paracetamol and aspirin often cheaper to purchase over the counter, we need to ensure that we are getting value for money for our NHS."" Labour health spokesman Anas Sarwar said: ""As more Scots continue to live longer, prescription costs are almost bound to rise due to more people living with long-term conditions that require treatment. ""This presents challenges not only for prescriptions but for a range of other services such as social care and GP practices. ""Labour continues to call on the SNP government to use the powers of the Parliament to give our NHS the funding it needs to end the staffing crisis in our health service."" Scottish Health Secretary, Jeane Freeman, said: ""The increase in costs for drugs dispensed in the community is in line with anticipated trend and reflects the fact more patients are being treated closer to home with specialist medicines traditionally reserved for hospital. ""These new treatments deliver better outcomes for patients and are best value for money for the NHS, however we expect NHS Scotland to always look for opportunities to work with pharmaceutical companies to reduce the cost for drugs wherever possible. ""Supply issues, an ageing population, increasingly complex health care needs, more people living with long term conditions, and the impact of the volatility in the value of the pound in recent years are also contributory factors to increased costs."" She then added: ""Legislation controlling what the NHS pays for medicines and supplies is currently reserved to the UK government and we are continuing to press them to ensure we can get best value."""
Volatility,Energy use advice campaign pulled as No 10 objects,2024-09-25,2022-10-07,By Damian Grammaticas,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-63170588,"The government has decided not to launch a public information campaign on reducing energy use this winter after the prime minister's office raised objections, the BBC has been told.   A source said there was a ""reasonably well-developed plan"" to encourage household energy-saving.  But Climate Minister Graham Stuart denied a Times report that a campaign had been blocked by Downing Street. He said UK energy was secure despite a National Grid warning of blackouts. Its message about possible power cuts was based on a worst-case scenario of gas shortages if the energy crisis in Europe escalates. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) was considering plans to encourage households to switch off their appliances and heating to conserve energy whenever possible during winter. However, the BBC was told the department was stopped from taking the plan forward because of objections from the prime minister's office and the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC).  DHSC sources said they did not believe they had played any specific role in any decision, but indicated there might be broad ""concern about the elderly being afraid to turn on their heating"". The Times newspaper reported that Downing Street's intervention came on Thursday when National Grid issued its warning. The UK is heavily reliant on gas to produce electricity, with gas-fired power stations generating more than 40% of the country's electricity. In the ""unlikely"" event that gas supplies ran extremely low, homes and businesses in the UK could face three-hour planned blackouts, National Grid said. The government says National Grid has drawn up plans to launch a voluntary service to reward users who reduce demand at peak times. Speaking on BBC Breakfast, Mr Stuart said he was ""confident the government has done everything in its power"" to make sure energy rationing would not be necessary this winter. But he added: ""We make plans for all scenarios."" During the Conservative leadership campaign, Prime Minister Liz Truss pledged there would be no energy rationing this winter. On Thursday, when asked if she could guarantee there would be no blackouts, Ms Truss said: ""We do have a good supply of energy in the UK.""  In a statement, BEIS said: ""There are no plans for the government to tell the public to reduce usage for the sake of our energy supplies.  ""The UK has a secure and diverse energy system and we are confident that the steps we are taking will protect security of electricity and gas supplies."" When asked to comment, Mr Stuart indicated there had been discussions within BEIS, but confirmed there would not be a government-led effort to get people to reduce usage, saying ""it has been decided that there will not be a campaign"". Mr Stuart also denied that a well-developed campaign had been prepared and then blocked by the prime minister's team. National Grid wants to be able to reduce British energy demand at peak times if there is going to be a shortage. This winter, starting in November, it is going to have 12 trial days where it asks customers who have signed up via their energy suppliers to reduce the amount of energy they are using at particular times of day.  They would be given a day's notice that they would be asked to do this. In return, they would be paid for using less energy. National Grid has not yet decided how this will work but has suggested that for the trial days customers might be able to make back £10 a day. Expect National Grid to announce more details later this month with customers being able to sign up from 1 November as long as their energy suppliers are participating in the scheme. The Times newspaper had reported that the prime minister had rejected plans for a £15m public information campaign, which was signed off by Business Secretary Jacob Rees-Mogg. It suggested Ms Truss was ""ideologically opposed"" to the campaign amid concerns it would be too interventionist. In her speech to the Conservative Party conference on Wednesday, the prime minister said her conservatism was about ""freedom"". ""I'm not going to tell you what to do, or what to think or how to live your life,"" she said. Some question whether a campaign is needed at a time when many people are already changing their behaviour and saving energy where they can. But those with knowledge of a campaign say they don't understand the logic of blocking it. ""Slightly mystifying,"" they say. In a tweet, Conservative MP Guy Opperman said he would he ""fully behind"" an energy-saving campaign that would help people and the taxpayer save money. ""This is not Nanny state,"" he wrote, arguing it was about ""preserving supply, saving money for everyone, and encouraging localism"". Stew Horne, head of policy at not-for-profit organisation Energy Saving Trust, said the government needed to consider how to reduce demand this winter to increase energy security. He said the European Commission had recently announced plans to reduce peak demand by 5% across EU member states. In Italy, central heating use will be reduced and households have been asked to turn down their thermostats to reduce energy demand. Mr Horne said he ""would welcome consideration of similar measures to improve energy security"". Russia's invasion of Ukraine has caused turmoil and volatility in the energy markets, sending fuel bills rocketing, and tightening supplies of oil and gas globally. Ahead of winter, countries across Europe are scrambling to shore up supplies, as gas flows from Russia are restricted. Since taking office Ms Truss's government has been seeking to boost energy security, with a ban on fracking for shale gas in England lifted last month, and a new oil and gas exploration licensing round launched on Friday. This comes after government stepped in with an energy support package to help people with soaring bills."

The index closed at 2,964.33, beating 21 June's previous high, with technology stocks driving the rise.  Market watchers say more optimism around a potential trade deal between the US and China led to the movement. And gold, often seen as a safe asset in times of uncertainty, fell 2% to $1,382 per ounce, the biggest drop since June 2018. The Dow Jones closed 0.44% higher at 26,717.43, while the Nasdaq finished 1.1% higher at 8,091.16. In Europe, both the UK's FTSE 100 index and Germany's Dax closed 1% higher. ""We're right back on track,"" US President Donald Trump said after the countries agreed to restart trade talks.  ""Gold tends to do well during times of concern over growth, market volatility or when markets think the powers-that-be are losing control of events,"" said Russ Mould, investment director at stockbroker AJ Bell. ""A trade deal would deal with all three issues and markets are happy to take the view that a deal is coming. Though it could still be a long time coming, if there is to be one at all."" Negotiations between China and the US have dominated market moves for months as positive statements are often followed by extra tariffs, sending stock, currency and commodity markets up and down. The latest moves follow a pledge to renew talks between the US and China, an agreement that was reached at the G20 summit in Japan. US President Donald Trump agreed to hold off on $300bn of new tariffs on goods and relaxed restrictions on Huawei, while China agreed to make new purchases of US farm equipment. Last year, the US imposed three rounds of tariffs on more than $250bn worth of Chinese goods. China hit back by imposing tariffs ranging from 5% to 25% on $110bn of US products. A truce agreed last December collapsed and in May the US raised tariffs on $200bn of Chinese products to 25% from 10%. Again China retaliated with tariff on $60bn of US goods. The price of gold is also retreating after gaining 8% in June, with prices exceeding $1,400 per troy ounce. ""Gold has just had a strong run. Nothing goes up in a straight line,"" said Mr Mould. While it earns no income, like a share or a bond would, gold's indestructible nature and its place in history as a store of value make it attractive to some investors in times of strife. Other safe-haven assets also declined, including the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc. The dollar rose 0.4% against the yen to 108.26, and advanced 0.7% on the franc to 0.9830 francs."
Volatility,US job growth surges in February,2024-09-25,2018-03-09,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-43345362,"Job creation in the US economy surged last month, but the annual rate of wage growth slowed. The economy created 313,000 jobs in February, official figures show, far in excess of analysts' expectations. However, the unemployment rate remained at 4.1%, while the annual earnings growth rate slowed to 2.6% last month. January's annual wage growth rate - which had triggered fears over inflationary pressures - was also revised down from 2.9% to 2.8%. The strong wage growth figure for January prompted sharp volatility on the stock market, as investors worried the US Federal Reserve would quicken the pace at which it increased interest rates. Despite a lower-than-expected wage increase in February, many economists said longer term trends still point to higher wages. The US economy is in its ninth year of economic expansion, with an upswing in global growth and tax cuts passed last year helping to boost growth. Friday's report from the US Labor Department showed the biggest increase in jobs since July 2016, sending major stock indexes higher. The three major US stock indexes climbed almost 2% by the close of trading and the Nasdaq closed at a record high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 440 points, or 1.77%, to end at 25,335, the S&P 500 gained 47 points, or 1.74%, to 2,786 and the Nasdaq ended up 132 points, or 1.79%, to 7,560. ""We have an economy that is firing on all cylinders and the job market is a reflection of that,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Bank. February's gains included an increase of 61,000 construction jobs - the biggest rise since 2007. The manufacturing sector also added 31,000 jobs, while retail employment rebounded from declines last year. The number of people working or looking for work also jumped by more than 800,000 last month. That was the biggest monthly rise in the labour force in more than two decades and boosted the labour force participation rate to 63%. Despite the rise, the unemployment rate held steady at 4.1%, where it has hovered since October.   Those figures provided fodder for analysts who say wage growth could be moderated by a large number of potential workers sitting on the sidelines. ""The huge gain in payrolls belies the notion that the [labour] market has truly reached full employment,"" said Sophia Koropeckyj of Moody's Analytics. Increasing participation by men of prime working age - between 25 and 54 years - has helped drive the labour force participation rate higher in recent months, reflecting a resurgence in sectors such as manufacturing. But Ms Koropeckyj said she does not expect the labour force to continue growing at last month's pace, pointing to challenges such as skill gaps and opioid addiction.  Americans are also moving less, fuelling a geographic mismatch between jobs and job seekers and hardening regional disparities.  ""There's only so much of a boost you can get because a lot of people are structurally unemployed,"" she said. ""Certainly there is slack, but how much of it will be practically absorbed is questionable."" Ms Koropeckyj said a tighter labour market makes slow acceleration in wage growth ""inevitable"" this year.  The average hourly wage for private sector workers was $26.75 last month, up 68 cents from February 2017 and 4 cents from January. Markets are expecting the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at least three times in 2018. But with the inflation rate lagging its target 2% rate, it has been waiting for signs - like strong wage growth - of pricing pressure. Analysts said strong hiring in February all but guarantees the Fed will raise rates at its meeting later this month, even if the figures were boosted by mild weather. But the relatively weak wage growth did little to resolve debates about whether policymakers will eventually move faster."
Volatility,New GCSEs 'hardest since O-levels',2024-09-25,2017-08-22,By Sean Coughlan,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-41000575,"The new-style GCSE exams in England are the most difficult since the end of O-levels in the 1980s, according to an independent school leader. The first results of revised GCSEs in English and maths will be published this week, with a grading system using numbers from 9 to 1. Barnaby Lenon, chairman of the Independent Schools Council, says they will stretch the most able students. But he urges universities to be cautious about using the top grade 9. ""Universities should not consider the distinction between an 8 and a 9 worth making until they have evidence that it does indicate something,"" Mr Lenon writes in an article to be published later this week. ""After all, 95% might get you a grade 8, 96-to-100% a grade 9. Does the grade 9 student have greater intellectual ability and academic potential or are they simply better at writing fast, or better at checking for silly errors?  ""Only time, and analysis of results, will tell."" The new-style exams, beginning with English and maths, will no longer use coursework or modules, but will be graded on final exams. Mr Lenon predicted that schools that had relied on coursework to boost results could ""suffer a fall in grades this year"". He argues that coursework was an ""unreliable measure"" of ability, ""much of it had little value"" and it could too easily be ""influenced"" by teachers or parents. There will also be changes to the syllabuses to make them more demanding. While much of the attention will be on the new grading system, Mr Lenon says it is important not to miss the scale of change for the qualification. ""They contain questions of a level of difficulty that we have not seen since the abolition of O-levels in 1987,"" says Mr Lenon. This is intended to stretch pupils in England so that they can catch up with the standards of pupils in east Asia, he says. But if the new exams provide more challenge for the most gifted pupils, he says the impact at the average and lower ability end remains uncertain. ""Raising the bar"" will not necessarily help these pupils, he says, unless they have the support to ""jump higher"". ""It is the quality of teaching of less able or less diligent pupils that will help them to succeed in their GCSEs."" Head teachers' leader Geoff Barton said that schools would be concerned about ""volatility"" in the results of individual schools, below the surface of national results. Mr Barton, head of the ASCL head-teachers' union, said there should be caution about interpreting and comparing the results of such a different form of GCSE. Teachers and pupils would have to adjust to a different style of qualification, he said, and he warned against people ""springing to judgement"" over unanticipated results. John Blake, head of education at the Policy Exchange think tank, backed the changes. ""These new GCSEs are demanding, and rightly so,"" said Mr Blake.  ""The comparison with O-level is a good one - those qualifications were designed for our most academic children, and as we improve our curriculum and our expectations of all our young people, it is right they be the benchmark for success."" GCSE results are to be published on Thursday - including the first wave of new 9-to-1 grades. There have been warnings of confusion over numerical grading and questions about a system that will have two different types of pass grade - with grade 4 a ""standard"" pass and grade 5 a ""strong"" pass. The Institute of Directors warned last week that some employers might not understand the new grades and would see them as ""gibberish""."
Volatility,Third of world in recession this year - IMF head,2024-09-25,2023-01-02,By Suranjana Tewari and Peter Hoskins,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-64142662,"A third of the global economy will be in recession this year, the head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned. Kristalina Georgieva said 2023 will be ""tougher"" than last year as the US, EU and China see their economies slow. It comes as the war in Ukraine, rising prices, higher interest rates and the spread of Covid in China weigh on the global economy. In October the IMF cut its global economic growth outlook for 2023. ""We expect one third of the world economy to be in recession,"" Ms Georgieva said on the CBS news programme Face the Nation. ""Even countries that are not in recession, it would feel like recession for hundreds of millions of people,"" she added. Katrina Ell, an economist at Moody's Analytics in Sydney, gave the BBC her assessment of the world economy. ""While our baseline avoids a global recession over the next year, odds of one are uncomfortably high. Europe, however, will not escape recession and the US is teetering on the verge,"" she said. The IMF cut its outlook for global economic growth in 2023 in October, due to the war in Ukraine as well as higher interest rates as central banks around the world attempt to rein in rising prices. Since then China has scrapped its zero-Covid policy and started to reopen its economy, even as coronavirus infections have spread rapidly in the country. Ms Georgieva warned that China, the world's second largest economy, would face a difficult start to 2023. ""For the next couple of months, it would be tough for China, and the impact on Chinese growth would be negative, the impact on the region will be negative, the impact on global growth will be negative,"" she said. The IMF is an international organisation with 190 member countries. They work together to try to stabilise the global economy. One of its key roles is to act as an early economic warning system. Ms Georgieva's comments will be alarming for people around the world, not least in Asia which endured a difficult year in 2022.  Inflation has been steadily rising across the region, largely because of the war in Ukraine, while higher interest rates have also hit households and business. Figures released over the weekend pointed to weakness in the Chinese economy at the end of 2022. The official purchasing managers' index (PMI) for December showed that China's factory activity shrank for the third month in a row and at the fastest rate in almost three years as coronavirus infections spread in the country's factories. In the same month home prices in 100 cities fell for the sixth month in a row, according to a survey by one of the country's largest independent property research firms, China Index Academy. On Saturday, in his first public comments since the change in policy, President Xi Jinping called for more effort and unity as China enters what he called a ""new phase"". The downturn in the US also means there is less demand for the products that are made in China and other Asian countries including Thailand and Vietnam. Higher interest rates also make borrowing more expensive - so for both these reasons companies may choose not to invest in expanding their businesses. The lack of growth can trigger investors to pull money out of an economy and so countries, especially poorer ones, have less cash to pay for crucial imports like food and energy. In these kinds of slowdowns a currency can lose value against those of more prosperous economies, compounding the issue. The impact of higher interest rates on loans affects economies at the government level too - especially emerging markets, which may struggle to repay their debts. For decades the Asia-Pacific region has depended on China as a major trading partner and for economic support in times of crisis. Now Asian economies are facing the lasting economic effects of how China has handled the pandemic. The manufacture of products such as Tesla electric cars and Apple iPhones may get back on track as Beijing ends zero-Covid. But renewed demand for commodities like oil and iron ore is likely to further increase prices just as inflation appeared to have peaked. ""China's relaxed domestic Covid restrictions are not a silver bullet. The transition will be bumpy and a source of volatility at least through the March quarter,"" Ms Ell said. Bill Blaine, strategist and head of alternative assets at Shard Capital, described the IMF's warning as ""a good wake up and smell the coffee moment"". ""Even though labour markets around the world are fairly strong, the kind of jobs being created are not necessarily high paying and we're going to have a recession, we are not going to see interest rates fall as rapidly as the markets think,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""That's going to create a whole series of consequences that will keep markets on tenterhooks for at least the first half of 2023."""
Volatility,Rees-Mogg says market turmoil not due to mini-budget,2024-09-25,2022-10-12,By Beth Timmins,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63230001,"Jacob Rees-Mogg has claimed market turmoil is not linked to the mini-budget in which the chancellor announced big tax cuts without the usual analysis of the economic impact. The business secretary said volatility was ""more to do with interest rates than a minor part of fiscal policy."" He said the Bank of England had not raised rates as fast as the US. But economists and some MPs said the plans had worried investors, pointing to the surge in borrowing costs. Investors are often wary of putting money into countries that are increasing their debt. And if a country raises its interest rates it means investors will get a bigger return on their money if they put it into that country's banks and assets. After the mini-budget, the pound plunged and government borrowing costs surged. ""What has caused the effect in pension funds... is not necessarily the mini-budget. It could just as easily be the fact that the day before the Bank of England did not raise interest rates as much as the (US) Federal Reserve did,"" he said. ""Jumping to conclusions about causality is not meeting the BBC's requirement for impartiality"" he said, after a suggestion the chancellor's actions had been the trigger for the fluctuations in the value of the pound and government bonds. At the first PMQs since the mini-budget, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused Prime Minister Liz Truss of ""ducking the question"" when asked whether she agreed with the business secretary. Ms Truss said the government had taken ""decisive action"", adding ""as a result of our action... we will see higher growth and lower inflation."" Separately, speaking at the Treasury Select Committee on Wednesday Deutsche Bank's chief UK economist Sanjay Raja said the mini-budget on 23 September was the ""straw that broke the camel's back"". He said the ""trade shock"" because of Brexit is a factor, and added: ""You throw on the 23 September event, you've got a side-lined financial watchdog, you've got lack of a medium-term fiscal plan, one of the largest unfunded tax cuts we've seen since the early 1970s, it was kind of the straw that broke the camel's back."" The Resolution Foundation's Torsten Bell said it was clear the huge package of cuts, which was downgraded to £43bn after Mr Kwarteng's U-turn on the top rate of income tax, should not have happened in the current financial climate. He said the sacking of the Treasury's top civil servant Sir Tom Scholar and the lack of a report on the economic impact from independent forecaster the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) had contributed to investor unease. ""It was no surprise to any of us that this is where you end up"". ""This is what happens if you aren't paying attention,"" he said. ""It was always going to be hard but it was exactly because it was always going to be hard that you don't do this."" The latest official statistics showed the economy unexpectedly shrank in August, strengthening predictions that it will fall into a recession. Professor Jagjit Chadha, director of National Institute of Economic and Social Research (Niesr) told the Commons Treasury Committee that the ""real danger"" seen after the mini-budget was ""obviously on the back of what can only be described as guerrilla tactics against our independent economic institutions over the summer - the Treasury, the Bank of England and the Office for Budget Responsibility"".  Gerard Lyons, an economist who advised Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng during the leadership contest, speaking on the BBC's World at One programme admitted that the mini-budget ""misread"" the country's financial situation.  However, he argued that everything that has happened was not ""solely due to the mini-budget"" but also down to parts of the financial system that were vulnerable to interest rates going up.  The Bank of England has warned interest rates could rise again after the value of the pound plummeted, following the government's decision to cut taxes and borrow more.  After the market turmoil, it stepped in with an emergency bond-buying intervention designed to stabilise the economy but said this scheme would end on Friday. Deputy Governor Ramsden said he was ""acutely"" aware that millions of households and businesses were experiencing ""real hardship"", noting that ""many"" of the policy actions were ""adding to the difficulties caused by the current situation"".   Prime Minister Liz Truss has said the promised tax cuts will boost UK economic growth and therefore help pay for themselves. The chancellor has committed to fast tracking the independent forecast by the OBR, the independent budget watchdog, at the same time as his economic plan detailing how he will pay for the planned tax cuts - which is now due to be announced on 31 October."
Volatility,"UK will judge Russia by its actions, says minister",2024-09-25,2022-02-16,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-60401102,"The UK will ""judge Russia by its actions"" after reports it is moving back troops from the border of Ukraine, says Defence Secretary Ben Wallace. He said the UK government would ""take them at their word"", but it was ""too soon to tell"" if the move was genuine. Russia's defence ministry claimed on Tuesday that it had withdrawn some troops conducting military exercises in districts bordering Ukraine. But Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky said the exit was not visible. Nato's secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, also said the alliance had not seen any evidence of a departure by Russian troops. Speaking ahead of a meeting of Nato member defence ministers, he said: ""So far we have not seen any de-escalation on the ground - on the contrary, it appears that Russia continues the military build-up."" Reports had suggested that US intelligence believed an invasion could be launched in the early hours of Wednesday. But while that has not happened, US President Joe Biden warned a Russian attack on Ukraine was ""still very much a possibility"", and the human cost would be ""immense"". After a call between UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his Japanese counterpart Fumio Kishida, the leaders said any invasion would ""shake the foundations of the international order and have severe consequences"".  The Ministry of Defence confirmed it was increasing British forces in Estonia, as well as sending additional Apache helicopters to the region, and sending four additional Typhoon jets for air patrols. The department said the increase would bring British troop numbers in the country to the high hundreds, but not thousands. Russia has long been opposed to the former Soviet republic of Ukraine growing closer to Europe and its institutions.  President Vladimir Putin has demanded a guarantee from the West that Ukraine will not join Nato - a defensive alliance of 30 countries - but Nato has said it will not close down any future agreements. Russia has amassed more than 100,000 troops along Ukraine's border. President Putin insists Russia is not planning to invade, but the US and European countries - including the UK - have been providing support to Ukraine, such as training and weapons, and numerous governments have told their citizens to leave the country.  Analysis by Paul Adams, BBC diplomatic correspondent  Think of this crisis as theatre - actors move across the stage, soliloquies are delivered. There are ""sounds off"", ambiguous and open to interpretation. We are all mesmerised by Russia's troop movements, constantly asking ourselves what each set of pictures means. And that's what the director of this theatre, Vladimir Putin, intends. He wants to keep us guessing. It's perfectly possible that the sight of Russian armour, crossing the Kerch strait from Crimea, represents a hoped-for sign of de-escalation. But as Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg has reminded everyone, it's way too early to make any reliable judgement on what it all means. Vast numbers of Russian troops remain massed close to Ukraine's borders, arrayed in a fashion that western intelligence agencies can only interpret one way - this is an invasion force. That doesn't mean an invasion is coming. But even as the Kremlin denies it has any hostile intention, it suits President Putin for everyone to think that the stage is set for this drama's big battle scene. The UK has also pledged to impose tougher sanctions on Russia in the event of an invasion. But legislation to carry out the threat still needs to be approved by the British Parliament, which is currently in recess. The BBC understands MPs could be asked to sign off the plan early next week when they return to Westminster to send a message that the measures are ready and waiting.   Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer called for ""proper action"" on Russian cash and influence in the UK, adding: ""A failure to act now will only further strengthen Vladimir Putin in his attempts to stalk and menace his neighbours and democracies around the world."" Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Wallace said the UK was offering offering ""a range of forces - air, sea and land"" in support, with a doubling of troops in neighbouring Estonia and 1,000 more on standby if Nato calls on them.  He said the troops would not be deployed if the situation between Russia and Ukraine de-escalated, but added it was ""important we make the plans so Russia knows we are serious about deterrence"". On reports Russia was moving back some of its troops from the border, Mr Wallace said: ""We will take them at their word, but judge them by their actions."" He added: ""I would be the first to be delighted by a de-escalation, we have all been working towards that, but we see 60% of Russia's land forces amassed on the Ukrainian and Belarus borders.  ""I am an ex-soldier, that is not normal exercising, especially when you see the depth of deployments."" Earlier, the UK defence secretary told BBC Breakfast the build up of Russian troops on the ground had ""shown the opposite of the rhetoric coming out of the Kremlin"", but no-one knew what the country's leader was thinking.  ""President Putin hasn't made a decision yet and, until a decision is made, none of us will know what will happen next."" But he said Russia ""hasn't got its way [as] Nato has not shut out people who wish to apply"". Countries in the West - including the UK - have threatened to introduce tough sanctions on Russia if they invade Ukraine. But what are the possible measures they could introduce? Banning Russia from Swift: The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, or Swift, is an international banking transaction system. Russia is heavily reliant on Swift due to its multibillion exports of hydrocarbons traded in US dollars. Cutting the country off would terminate all international transactions, trigger currency volatility, and cause massive capital outflows. The US could also ban Russia from financial transactions involving US dollars - the world's reserve currency - meaning Russia would be extremely limited in what it could buy and sell around the world.  Targeted export controls: The West could restrict the export of key commodities to Russia, such as goods containing American technology, like semiconductor microchips, which are used in everything from cars to smartphones. Energy restrictions and Nord Stream 2: Russia's economy is hugely dependent on selling gas and oil overseas. But the West could make it illegal for countries and companies to buy oil from the big Russian energy giants such as Gazprom or Rosneft. Europe could also put a halt to Nord Stream 2, a 759-mile proposed pipeline designed to transport gas from Russia to Germany. But Europe is already facing inflation and a cost of living crisis due to low supplies of gas. Target individuals: Not only associates of Vladimir Putin but the Russian president himself. A total of 185 Russian individuals, many of whom were involved in the annexation of the Crimea and the separatist movement in Eastern Ukraine, are already subject to sanctions, including asset freezes and travel bans.  London clampdown: The British government has threatened to block Russian companies from raising capital in London and to expose property and company ownership. Sanctions could also be imposed to restrict the ability of Russian individuals to invest and live in London. According to the Office for National Statistics, Russian investment in the UK accounted for £25.5bn in 2016."
Volatility,Cardiff Airport posts £18.5m pre-tax loss,2024-09-25,2019-12-31,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-50955180,"Cardiff Airport has posted a pre-tax loss of £18.5m, nearly three times higher than the previous year. The Welsh Government-owned airport said global economic factors such as climate change, uncertainty over Brexit and rising fuel prices had had an impact on the aviation sector. However its turnover has risen by nearly £3m to £20.8m and it reported 15 months of continuous growth. The Welsh Government said the airport contributed £250m to the economy. Although the annual report focused on the financial year 2018-2019, outgoing chairman Roger Lewis noted the collapse of the Thomas Cook holiday chain in September had had ""limited impact"" on the 2019-2020 year with the loss of only 16,000 passengers. But he warned the coming year would see a loss of approximately 150,000 passengers because of Thomas Cook's demise, and the airport would ""seek opportunities to replace this operator"". He highlighted successes in attracting more passengers to the airport, with the first year of Qatar Airways' flights to Doha bringing 70,000 passengers during the 2018-2019 financial year and Flybe's business increasing by 4%. He also noted the package operator Tui had introduced an additional 100,000 seats for summer 2019. Passenger numbers passed the 1.5 million mark in May 2018 and summer 2018 was the airport's busiest in a decade. The airport was taken over by the Welsh Government in 2013. Mr Lewis wrote: ""While we were very pleased to note substantial continued growth over the reporting period, we also saw increased signs of major global economic factors such as the ongoing uncertainty over Brexit and concomitant sterling weakness, climate change and rising fuel prices impacting on the aviation sector."" He said in the light of ""continuing volatility"" in the global economy, and Brexit and currency ""uncertainty"", the airport had taken the decision to write down the estimated value of the airport's intangible assets - things such as intellectual property and brand recognition - by £9.3m. The airport said this was the main reason for the loss, although the write down is about half the pre-tax losses for the year. However, it has seen a large rise in a measure known as EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) by which airports are measured against one another from £7,000 in 2018 to £77,000 in 2019. The report noted the airport had ""invested heavily"" in its commercial operations at the end of the 2017-2018 financial year, increasing the size of the departure lounge and the departure terminal's food and shopping outlets, as well as offering a car park meet and greet service. It said: ""The business continues to see the benefit of increased commercial returns from these operations."" Huw Lewis, chief operating officer at the airport, said: ""During this period we have invested in our operations and prepared for taking over the operation of the St Athan airfield. ""We have increased our headcount by over 9% to meet the growing business demands and brought forward our commitment to pay at least the real living wage to all Cardiff Airport employees."" A Welsh Government spokesman said: ""Since our acquisition of Cardiff Airport passenger numbers have increased by 70%. ""The airport contributes a quarter of a billion pounds to the Welsh economy every year and sustains around 2,400 aviation related jobs."""
Volatility,UK economy sees return to growth,2024-09-25,2011-04-27,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-13206430,"This video can not be played Mr Osborne said: 'Around the world we are facing some choppy economic conditions' The UK economy grew by 0.5% in the first three months of the year, official figures have shown, reducing the risk of a double-dip recession. The chancellor welcomed the return to growth, which followed a contraction of 0.5% at the end of 2010. But Labour said the economy was flat and the recovery had been ""choked off"".  The manufacturing and services sectors had performed well, the Office for National Statistics said, but construction output had fallen sharply.  Chancellor George Osborne said: ""It is good news that the British economy is growing. It is particularly good news that manufacturing is growing so strongly, when we have had such an unbalanced economy in recent years, and manufacturing has not done so well. ""Jobs have been created since the New Year and government borrowing is down,"" he added.  Ed Balls, Labour's shadow chancellor, responded: ""If George Osborne thinks zero growth over six months is good news and a sign that the recovery is on track then he is more out of touch and out of his depth than I feared. "" Economists gave a mixed response to the figures. David Kern, the chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: ""These figures were mixed and well below the Office for Budget Responsibility prediction that the economy would grow by 0.8% in the quarter.  ""Given the fragility of the recovery, it is vital for the government to persevere with policies that support growth, and remove the obstacles that prevent businesses from creating jobs and exporting."" Growth in manufacturing continued to be strong, at 1.1%, the same as the previous quarter. The GDP also figures showed that the services sector had returned to growth, after contracting during the bad weather at the end of last year. This had particularly been the case with hotels and restaurants, the ONS said.    However, construction - one of the worst hit areas in the last quarter of 2010 - was down by 4.7% at the start of 2011. Ross Walker, from RBS Financial Markets, said that as new data came in, the picture was likely to improve: ""You do have what looks to me like a surprisingly large fall in construction output. Do we really believe that the level of construction output was lower in January than in December? We may well see some revisions here."" These figures are an initial estimate and will be revised at least twice in the coming months as more information is gathered.  The low rate of growth could lessen the chance of an early interest rate rise by the Bank of England to combat inflation, which is currently running at 4%, analysts say. ""We are expecting the Bank of England to raise rates in August,"" said Deutsche Bank economist George Buckley, ""but it is far from certain whether they will do that"".   ""We will have the second quarter GDP numbers by then, but the problem is they may have been negatively affected by the royal wedding and two back-to-back bank holiday weekends which will depress production. ""It is still very uncertain. All of these figures are being affected by a lot of volatility, by holidays, the weather, snow. It has all had a big impact on the numbers.  The Prime Minister, David Cameron, said the growth in manufacturing indicated that the economy was moving away from its reliance on the service sector. But he added that bank lending was still a stumbling block: ""On the banks, we have an agreement with them they must increase their lending to businesses, large and small, and that needs to happen."" Separate figures released on Wednesday from the British Bankers' Association (BBA) showed that total net lending to companies fell in March by £4.7bn compared with a year ago, a slightly bigger fall than in February.

Volatility,Octopus Energy asks government for £1bn to buy Bulb,2024-09-25,2022-07-31,By Dearbail Jordan,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-62367992,"Octopus Energy is seeking £1bn in taxpayer funding to take over collapsed rival Bulb from the UK government. Bulb has been bailed out by the state and is being run by an administrator since going bust last November.  The £1bn funding is part of a package being discussed where Octopus would also pay more than £100m for Bulb's customers as well as entering a profit-sharing deal with the government. The government declined to comment ""due to commercial sensitivity"". The state bailout of Bulb is already expected to cost the taxpayer around £2bn by next year. But the Office for Budget Responsibility, the government's independent forecaster, said in March: ""Given the volatility in global energy markets, there remains uncertainty around the final cost."" It is understood that the additional £1bn being sought by Octopus, which was first reported by Sky News, would be paid back in full over time. It would be used to purchase energy in advance through a practice known as hedging. Octopus Energy declined to comment. Since Bulb's collapse in November, the price of wholesale gas has jumped by 78%, exacerbated by Russia's war in Ukraine and the Kremlin's decision to reduce energy supplies to Europe. Since Ofgem took over the running of Bulb, it has not been hedging its purchases of wholesale energy which sources said has led to higher costs.    Millions of UK households are bracing for a further steep rise in energy bills later this year.  Ofgem had expected the typical household to see an £800 increase in energy bills to £2,800 a year. But it recently said it would be higher and energy industry analysts Cornwall Insight said the typical domestic customer was likely to pay £3,244 a year from October. Bulb was one of more than 30 energy companies that collapsed last year following a spike in wholesale gas prices. Bulb, with 1.6 million customers, was the biggest firm to go bust but Ofgem estimates that the cost of all the other energy companies which collapsed in 2021 could reach £2.7bn - or £94 per customer. It includes the cost of transferring customers from failed energy providers to new firms. The £2.7bn figure is in addition to the billions of pounds earmarked for Bulb which, according to the National Audit Office, has already seen the government spend £900m to keep the company running. Octopus was the only bidder for Bulb, which filed for administration last year, and if a deal is agreed, it would significantly boost Octopus's 3.1 million customer base. The government has announced that households in England, Scotland and Wales will receive £400 to help with rising fuel bills in autumn. Tory leadership contenders Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak have also promised to reduce household energy bills.  Foreign Secretary Ms Truss said she would temporarily axe green energy taxes, which would save around £153 per year, while former chancellor Mr Sunak pledged to cut VAT on bills, a saving of around £160 per year.

Volatility,Tesco to go 'food waste free' by February,2024-09-25,2017-12-23,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-42464912,"No food fit for human consumption will be wasted by Tesco's UK stores by the end of February, the retail giant says. Chief executive Dave Lewis told the Daily Telegraph food waste had been ""talked about for years"" as he unveiled the plans for all 2,654 stores. Urging other chains to follow suit, he said edible food should be used for people, not go to waste.  Tesco, with all major UK supermarkets, has signed a commitment to cut food waste by one-fifth within a decade. The voluntary agreement is known as the Courtauld Commitment 2025.  Many supermarkets have introduced initiatives to tackle waste - such as moving away from ""buy-one-get-one-free"" offers that have been criticised for potentially increasing the amount of food thrown away in the home. East of England Co-op recently became the first major retailer to sell food beyond its ""best before"" dates. But Mr Lewis, who joined Tesco in 2014 from consumer brand Unilever, said the contrast between the amount of wasted food in the UK and the situation in countries suffering food shortages was ""really stark"". He said: ""Last year we sold 10 million tons [10.2 million tonnes] of food to the British public. But even if our waste is just 0.7% of the food, that's still 70,000 tons [71,100 tonnes] of food. ""And so long as that food is fit for human consumption, I'd much prefer it to go to people than animal feed or fuel."" The UK throws away 8.1 million tons [8.2 million tonnes] of food a year, according to the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee. Tesco says it cuts waste by selling surplus groceries with ""reduced to clear"" stickers and running a scheme giving unsold items to local charities. It uses an app, FoodCloud, to scan and upload surplus food that stores have at the end of the day, which is shared with registered charities that collect the food. ""That goes a long way in reducing charities' bill burdens, so they can spend the money on other things, like the cost of housing two more addicts, or providing much more needed services,"" Mr Lewis said. But he admitted it was ""impossible"" to prevent food surpluses in supermarkets. ""In retail there will always be some surplus food,"" he said. ""No matter how sophisticated the ordering systems are, it will be impossible to perfectly match the supply and demand for every one of our shops, 365 days a year, when there's so much volatility. ""Food waste has been talked about for years but if Tesco can make this work, with all of our different stores across the country, then why can't everybody,"" he added."
Volatility,Migrant children crisis: The big picture explained,2024-09-25,2018-06-20,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-44532437,"""Severely neglected"" children detained in what have been called squalid conditions, as well as deaths on the US-Mexico border, have brought the treatment of migrants into focus in the US. Lawyers who visited a border patrol facility in Clint, Texas, have described overcrowded cells, with children locked up without adult supervision or sufficient access to food or showers. The border authority has said it is trying to provide the ""best care possible"", but that it ""urgently"" needs additional funding to help the children, some of whom entered the US independently, and some of whom have been separated from their families. But why this is happening, and why now? Here, we have looked at three key pieces of context that will help you understand the fuller picture.  The numbers of people from Latin America seeking protection in the US and being held at the border are rising. There is not one specific reason why people are leaving Central America and Mexico for the US. But there are a few that are cited regularly. Reason one: Violence ""We leave our countries under threat. We leave behind our home, our relatives, our friends."" Maritza Flores, from El Salvador, was one of about 1,200 people who travelled in a so-called ""caravan"" of migrants north through Mexico in 2018, headed for the US border.  ""Many people think we left because we are criminals,"" Ms Flores told the BBC at the time. ""We're not criminals - we're people living in fear in our countries. All we want is a place where our children can run free - where they're not afraid to go out to the shops."" Gang violence is rife in El Salvador and Honduras. According to the most recent UN figures, the two nations had the two highest homicide rates in the world in 2016. Rights groups cite the influence of armed gangs who act with impunity - as well as the targeting of women and LGBTI people - as key factors for the high homicide rates. Among the most prevalent groups is MS-13, a brutal street gang that started in the US but is now thought to have at least 60,000 members in Central America. The gang is said to recruit at-risk and poor teenagers and demand they commit murder as an initiation rite, often using a machete. In El Salvador, MS-13 controls entire neighbourhoods. Over the past few years, there has been a significant increase in the number of people travelling to the US because they fear persecution by gangs like MS-13. While persecution is not the only reason people from Central America migrate to the US - economic volatility, natural disasters and the desire to join family members have also been cited by aid groups - there is evidence it is a growing factor, and a credible one. People seeking asylum in the US can request a ""credible fear"" interview if returning home would put their life at risk. An asylum officer then tries to establish if their request is based on a fear of persecution based on race, religion, nationality, political beliefs or membership of a particular group, including a gang. In the 2012 fiscal year, there were 13,880 credible fear applications. In 2018, according to US Citizenship and Immigration Services, there were 99,035 applications, and the vast majority were deemed to be justified in both years. In 2018, the highest number of credible fear applications came from citizens of Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. The UN refugee agency says that those three countries have all ""experienced a dramatic escalation in organised crime by gangs"" that have turned parts of the countries into ""some of the most dangerous places on earth"". Far from striking down credible fear applications, the Trump administration is granting them at an unprecedented rate. But Mr Trump has been keen to raise the threshold for what counts as ""credible fear"". In 2017, the attorney-general at the time, Jeff Sessions, said the system had been exploited.  A year later, he issued a ruling that said victims of domestic abuse and gang violence should no longer generally qualify for asylum in the US - although this was eventually struck down by a judge. But the US isn't the only country to which people are fleeing in large numbers. About 294,000 refugees from north and central America were registered worldwide during 2017, an increase of 58% on the previous year. ""We hear repeatedly from people requesting refugee protection, including from a growing number of children, that they are fleeing forced recruitment into armed criminal gangs and death threats,"" a UN statement said. As the number of people requesting credible fear interviews has increased, so too has the number of people being detained at the US border.  In May 2019, 144,278 people were held or denied entry while trying to cross the border, compared with 51,862 in the same month the year before. Reason two: Escaping poverty One UN survey of a group of migrants in January 2019 again found many were fleeing violence - 68.3% said they had had to change homes due to incidents related to violence or insecurity in the preceding 12 months. But 68% also said they were moving for better labour opportunities, and 12% for education opportunities. Countries in Central America are among the poorest in the world while the US is one of the richest, with the world's largest economy (by GDP): President Trump has repeatedly condemned economic migrants, saying two months after he launched his candidacy that ""they're taking our manufacturing jobs, they're taking our money."" However, many studies say that immigration produces net gains for the US economy. Those entering the US for a better quality of life are not considered refugees. However, US and international law currently says that people can seek asylum if they fear persecution at home on the basis of their race, political opinion, nationality, religion or because they belong to a particular social group. There's another factor to bear in mind too: climate change. With economies that are heavily reliant on agriculture, Central American countries are particularly vulnerable to changes in temperature and the weather. A number of recent reports - including a series by the New Yorker magazine - have acknowledged the role climate change is already playing in driving people from Central America. But one World Bank report last year said the number of people displaced because of climate change in Latin America could rise to 2.1 million by 2050. To understand the zero-tolerance policy on immigration, it helps to understand who is behind it. When Donald Trump announced his candidacy for the White House on 16 June, 2015, he set the tone for how he would later approach the presidency.  ""When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best,"" he said. ""They're sending people that have lots of problems... They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people."" And so, in early 2018, Mr Trump announced a ""zero tolerance"" policy to prosecute all adults who try to cross the US-Mexico border illegally, including those who planned to seek asylum in the US. Mr Trump often cites the dangers of MS-13, which sprung up among Salvadorean immigrants in 1980s Los Angeles and has since spread to at least 46 states. Mr Trump has called them ""animals"" and threatened to rid the US of their influence.  He has focused closely on immigration since becoming president, repeating many of the same claims he made on the day he ran for office. He has backed proposals to cut the number of legal immigrants to the US by 50% over the next 10 years, and by cracking down on immigration, he is not just sticking to a campaign promise, but playing to his base: his core supporters. A Washington Post - ABC News poll in April 2019 found that 63% of Republicans said they were more likely to support Mr Trump for re-election in 2020 given his handling of illegal immigration. However, the same poll found that his approach was less popular with Americans overall - with 44% of adults saying his approach made them more likely to oppose him, compared with 31% who were supportive. The zero tolerance policy also reveals the influence of one man in particular: Mr Trump's senior policy adviser, Stephen Miller, an immigration hardliner tasked with putting the president's words into actions. Mr Miller, one of the president's few original aides to keep their job, was the person who put together the ban on immigrants from majority-Muslim countries announced soon after Mr Trump came to office. The New York Times reported that in April 2018, when it became clear that the number of people being held at the border was growing significantly, Mr Miller pushed for a harder line on immigration. ""It was a simple decision,"" he told the New York Times. ""The message is that no-one is exempt from immigration law."" His position in 2019 is even more secure than a year earlier when the border crackdown began, thanks partly to the departure of immigration officials who supported less restrictive policies. Is it legal to separate families and detain children in poor conditions? This question goes to the centre of the debate on immigration and is not as easy to answer as you may think. Firstly, the policy of family separations at the border - a Trump policy, despite his claims to the contrary - ended after the initial outcry in 2018 with the president signing an executive order, then a judge separately ordering the practice to end. So why are some families still being separated? The New York Times has reported that 700 families had been separated in the past year via ""loopholes"" in the court order - when parents have a criminal conviction or a disease, or when it is an aunt, uncle, or sibling accompanying the child. Some parents may themselves be under 18 and also detained.  There is also significant debate about the conditions under which people are being kept. This too is because of a lack of clarity in the law. A 1997 court decision, known as the Flores Settlement Agreement, sets a standard which the US government must follow when it comes to treating migrant children. But the Department of Justice has sought to amend the agreement to allow it to hold children for longer, and has disputed interpretations of the 1997 court decision - most notably, when a government lawyer argued in June 2018 that the order does not specify that detained children be given showers, soap or toothbrushes. As long as children continue to be separated from their families, the legal challenges from both sides are likely to continue. But aside from the loopholes and the legal disputes, plain old bureaucracy also appears to be a problem. Unaccompanied children are by law supposed to be detained for only up to 72 hours. But several reports say many are being kept in detention centres - often in squalid conditions - for much longer, as government agencies struggle to process the vast number of people being held at the border. ""The agents are working their tails off trying to get this squared away,"" one immigration official told the Washington Post in May 2019, ""but it's a daily struggle with the amount of people we're encountering."""
Volatility,How will history judge President Trump?,2024-09-25,2019-01-17,By Nick Bryant,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-46895634,"Hostile historians may come to regard Donald Trump's presidency as an aggregation of the lesser traits of his predecessors.  The bullying of Lyndon Baines Johnson, who demeaned White House aides and even humiliated his Vice-President Hubert Humphrey - forcing his deputy once to recite a speech on Vietnam while he listened, legs akimbo, trousers round his ankles, on the toilet.  The intellectual incuriosity of Ronald Reagan, who once apologised to his then White House Chief of Staff James Baker for not reading his briefing books with the immortal excuse: ""Well, Jim, The Sound of Music was on last night."" The shameless lies of Bill Clinton about his affair with Monica Lewinsky. The paranoia of Richard Nixon, who in his final days railed, King Lear-like, at portraits hanging on the White House walls. The incompetence of George W Bush, whose failure to master basic governance partly explained his administration's botched response to the aftermath of the war in Iraq and also to Hurricane Katrina. The historical amnesia of Gerald Ford, whose assertion during a 1976 presidential debate that Eastern Europe was not dominated by Moscow was a forerunner of Trump's recent endorsement of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. The strategic impatience of Barack Obama, whose instinct always was to withdraw US forces from troublesome battlefields, such as Iraq, even if the mission had not yet been completed. Even the distractedness of John F Kennedy, who whiled away afternoons in the White House swimming pool with a bevy of young women to sate his libido, a sexualised version, perhaps, of Donald Trump sitting for his hours in front of his flat-screen TV watching friendly right-wing anchors massage his ego.  At the midpoint of Donald Trump's first term, historians have struggled to detect the kind of virtues that offset his predecessors' vices: the infectious optimism of Reagan; the inspirational rhetoric of JFK; the legislative smarts of LBJ; or the governing pragmatism of Nixon. So rather than being viewed as the reincarnation of Ronald Reagan or Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Trump gets cast as a modern-day James Buchanan, Franklin Pierce or William Harrison. Last year, a poll of nearly 200 political science scholars, which has routinely placed Republicans higher than Democrats, ranked him 44th out of the 44 men who have occupied the post (for those wondering why Trump is the 45th president, Grover Cleveland served twice).  Though the president has likened himself to Abraham Lincoln, who posterity has deemed to be greatest of all presidents, this survey judged him to be the worst of the worst. Even the conservative scholars, who identified themselves as Republicans, placed him 40th. Were it not for his braggadocio, Donald Trump might receive a more positive historical press. A recurring problem, after all, is that he gets judged against his boasts. He can point to a significant record of right-wing accomplishment.  Tax reform. Two Supreme Court nominees safely installed on the bench. The travel ban. The bonfire of federal regulations. Criminal justice reform. Legislative action aimed at ameliorating the opioid crisis. Nato members ponying up more cash. Annual wage growth is at a nine-year high. 2018 was the best year for job creation since 2015. Many of his campaign pledges, such as the renegotiation of the Nafta free-trade agreement and the relocation of the US embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, have been kept. Promise made, promise kept is one of his boasts that regularly rings true.  Often, though, he blunts the impact of authentic good news with inflated claims. US Steel is not opening up six new plants. He is not the author of the biggest tax cut in American history. Besides, the trade war has penalised US manufacturers and farmers, and in 2018 the stock market suffered its worst year since the 2008 financial meltdown.  This market volatility highlights other Trump tendencies contributing to his poor reviews: pointing to a buoyant stock market as a metric of personal success, the downside of which is the downswing; and blaming others when things go south, in this case the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell. Trump sits in the Oval Office behind what's called the Resolute desk, hewn from the timber of an abandoned British warship and first used by John F Kennedy, a former navy man himself. But on it you will not find the desk sign favoured by Harry S Truman: ""The Buck Stops Here.""  This America First president is himself an American first. Indeed, a further reason for the disdain of historians is because, historically speaking, his administration has been like no other. The chaos of staff turnover - two secretaries of state, two secretaries of defence, two attorneys general, three White House chiefs of staff, and a revolving door of senior West Wing aides. The foreign policy by tweet. The chumminess with adversarial authoritarian leaders, such as Kim Jong-un and Vladimir Putin. The blurring of ethical lines supposedly separating the Trump White House from the Trump business empire. The Russia collusion investigation, which has raised questions, so far unsettled, about his true allegiance.  Nor have we ever witnessed a US leader who has so flagrantly flouted the normal rules of presidential behaviour. The playground nicknames. The Twitter tirades. The ugly slurs - ""horseface"" for Stormy Daniels, a former porn star with whom he was once apparently intimate. In response to indictments in the Mueller probe, he has sometimes sounded more like the boss of a crime family. ""A rat"" is how he described his former lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen, deploying the lingua franca of the Mafioso.  Though he claims to offer exemplary moral leadership, even conservatives have criticised his presidency for being a profile of amorality, whether in response to the murder of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi or the neo-Nazi torchlight protest in Charlottesville. One of my abiding memories from the past two years came in the lobby of Trump Tower during that extraordinary press availability held a few days afterwards, when he suggested a ""very fine people"" equivalence between far-right protesters and their opponents. Standing next to me was an African-American cameraman, who abandoned his tripod so that he could join reporters in hurling questions, something that rarely, if ever, happens at press conferences. ""What should I tell my children?"" he shouted. ""What should I tell my children?""  With each bizarre press encounter and each ALL CAPS tweet, it can sometimes feel as if America is living through some historical counterfactual. It is as if the right-wing populist Pat Buchanan managed to beat George Herbert Walker Bush to the Republican presidential nomination in 1992 and, on the strength of his fiery culture war speech to the GOP convention, went on to beat Bill Clinton. Buchanan launched his insurgent campaign with a plea to put ""America First"" and used the mantra ""Make America Great Again."" Or maybe the Trump presidency is what a Perot administration might have looked like. Ross Perot, who also sought the presidency in 1992, was another populist billionaire and deep state conspiracy theorist. Yet even Buchanan and Perot, one suspects, would have been more orthodox. This alternative history feel to the Trump presidency partly explains why some of the dystopian ""Could it happen here?"" novels, such as Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale and George Orwell's 1984 have received a ""Trump bump"" in sales. Phillip Roth's The Plot Against America has also become a touchstone work. It imagines as president the aviator Charles Lindbergh, the telegenic spokesman for the isolationist ""America First Committee,"" who turns the USA into a more authoritarian state. These dystopian analogies, however, are often not analogous. Donald Trump's America is not Margaret Atwood's Gilead, or George Orwell's Oceania. And just as the billionaire unwisely compares himself to the heroes of history, a trait which inevitably invites ridicule, his more strident critics over-reach when they liken him to history's worst villains. He is not a modern-day Adolf Hitler, nor an American Mussolini.  When Donald Trump took the oath of office, nobody should have been surprised that an anti-politician would morph into an anti-president. In 2016 Americans rejected politics as usual. And diehard supporters still throng his rallies, wearing Make America Great Again caps and chanting for him to build the wall and lock up Hillary Clinton. His approval ratings among Republicans remain strong - 88% according to Gallup. His overall approval rating - 37% according to Gallup - is on a par with Ronald Reagan's at the two-year mark. Yet the rally chants of ""four more years"" remain a wish rather than a prophecy, and the setbacks suffered by the Republicans in November's congressional elections point to an underlying weakness: the disaffection of moderate Republicans, who were never enthusiastic about Donald Trump but who refused to countenance Hillary Clinton as president. Trump remains the only president in the history of the Gallup poll not to crack the 50% threshold.  Because Donald Trump is unwilling to accept he is anything other than an A+ president, the grade he has bestowed upon himself, he is not prepared to adopt the kind of correctives that have saved troubled presidencies. JFK learnt from the disaster of the Bay of Pigs and the bullying he received from Nikita Khrushchev at the Vienna summit in 1961, which was followed in short order by the Soviet construction of the Berlin Wall. Confronted a year later with the Cuban Missile Crisis, he was less trusting of his generals, who urged airstrikes, and less willing to be pushed around by Khrushchev.  Bill Clinton, who was accused of liberal over-reach during his first months in office and was punished as a result in the 1994 mid-term elections, tacked back to the political centre in time to win re-election in 1996. This is not a learning presidency. Incumbents can also benefit from self-doubt, a trait Donald Trump seems to regard as a character flaw. Presidents also usually grow in office. But while there are physical signs the 72-year-old is ageing - unable to holiday in Florida over Christmas, he has looked especially tired these past few days - there is little sign he is maturing.   It does not help that so many senior figures within his administration and his party treat him like a child monarch. The cabinet meeting where holders of the highest offices of state went around the table lavishing praise upon the president felt like Pyongyang on the Potomac. Vice-President Mike Pence has perfected the devoted gaze of the prototypical political wife. Senior Republicans, who privately roll their eyes, have been admiring, even sycophantic, in his presence. For the most part, international leaders have also opted for obsequiousness. Not only did Theresa May rush to Washington to invite Trump for a state visit - a state visit that has still not been diarised - she telephoned him on Air Force One to congratulate him after the mid-term election, even though the Democrats regained the House of Representatives. All this after Trump has frequently undermined her leadership over Brexit and trampled over the special relationship. One of the reasons Mr Trump is said to look so contemptuously upon Angela Merkel is because she makes so little effort to conceal her contempt for him. At the two-year mark, it is usually clear how incumbents will leave their mark on the presidency. After the torpidity of the Eisenhower years, Kennedy made the office more youthful and glamorous. Johnson, that shrewd ""Master of the Senate"", brought the executive and legislative branches into closer alignment. Nixon consolidated more power in the White House, accelerating the trend the liberal historian Arthur M Schlesinger Jr dubbed ""the imperial presidency.""  Ford reversed much of that process, even going as far to drop the playing of ""Hail to the Chief"" when he made an entrance. The cardigan-wearing Jimmy Carter, who used to go from room to room turning off lights to save energy, suburbanised the White House. Reagan, who restored many of the ceremonial trappings, erased the lines between politics and entertainment.  Clinton, in the age of Oprah, made the office more empathetic, narrowing the emotional distance between the presidency and the people. Obama set a new standard for ethical behaviour - motivated in part by the African-American mantra of working twice as hard to get half as far - and also made the presidency more hip. By abrogating behavioural customs, Donald Trump has made the presidency more uncouth and less trustworthy. By departing from executive and managerial norms, he has made domestic and foreign policy-making more impulsive and disorderly. By fraying traditional alliances, he has made the US presidency more isolated. By threatening to declare a national emergency in the funding row over his wall along the Mexican border, he has also indicated a willingness to discard constitutional norms that could mean exceeding constitutional limits.  The cumulative effect of this has been to make the Oval Office a focal point of perpetual turmoil and uncertainty, with the White House hostage to the changing whims and temper of its occupant. Governing sometimes feels secondary to winning political and cultural battles, and slaying opponents.  His presidency has become a roiling permanent campaign. Will his impact bring about more permanent changes? That will depend, to a large extent, on whether or not he wins a second term. Defeat in 2020 would represent a repudiation of his leadership style. Victory would be validating. Yet even as a one-term president, Trump would have changed the character of the presidency and US politics more broadly.  While it is hard to imagine America's 46th or 47th presidents unleashing the same barrage of insults, there are already signs of a ""Trump effect"" on political discourse. Many mid-term races featured unusually ugly rhetoric. Hours after being sworn in as a new Democratic congresswoman, Rashida Tlaib used a profane epithet as she called for the president's impeachment. What is known as the Overton window, the broadly agreed parameters of acceptable public discourse, has shifted to the right. I well remember the moment during the 2016 campaign when an email from the Trump campaign dropped into our inboxes announcing he would ban all Muslims from entering the United States. Initially we thought it might have been a hoax, for it seemed so far outside the mainstream of American political thought. Now, though, calls for a Muslim ban would raise eyebrows and provoke protests but hardly drop jaws.  The phrase ""Trump has normalised the abnormal"" has itself become a cliché. Still, though, I am constantly struck by how many Trump stories and scandals that ordinarily would have launched months, even years, of critical coverage for previous presidents sometimes barely last a single news cycle. More long-lasting could be the debasement of facts as the basis for debate and policy formulation. By its own admission, this administration has sometimes deployed what the White House aide Kellyanne Conway memorably labelled ""alternative facts"", starting on day one with false claims about the size of the inauguration crowd. Since then, the Washington Post has listed more than 7,000 presidential falsehoods. But an unsettling lesson of the Trump presidency is that post-truth politics can be highly effective, especially when it comes to shoring up a political base.  As for chaotic governance, future administrations will surely be more stable in terms of staff turnover, and more orderly when it comes to forming and executing policy. But it is easy to imagine Trump's successors pushing the bounds of executive authority in ways that breach constitutional norms, especially now that gridlock on Capitol Hill has become such a permanent feature of Washington politics.  Obama, to a howl of protests from congressional Republicans, relied heavily on executive orders, the flourish of his presidential pen. Trump has gone a big step further by threatening to invoke emergency powers to bypass a hostile Congress. Stress tests for the US constitution, even full-blown constitutional crises, could easily become more commonplace.  The Trump presidency's first drafts of history - most notably Bob Woodward's bestseller Fear - have painted a portrait of unprecedented dysfunction. If former senior administration officials pen honest participant histories - say former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, ex-Secretary of Defence James Mattis or former chief of staff John Kelly - they are likely, if their parting comments offer any guide, to add more detail and texture to that same picture.  If some of the renowned presidential biographers turn their attention to Trump - maybe Jon Meacham, David McCullough or Michael Beschloss, who in the past have rescued the reputations of under-rated presidents such as George Herbert Walker Bush and Harry S Truman - they are unlikely to deliver laudatory manuscripts. The histories already written, along with those taking shape, will someday be housed in the Donald J Trump Presidential Library, an addition to the 13 existing presidential libraries that form part of the National Archive. Will it be a landmark to US greatness or a modern-day American folly? Even with two years left to run of this history-defying presidency, most Americans, one suspects, have already made up their minds. Follow Nick Bryant on Twitter ."
Volatility,"Global food prices hit fresh 10-year high, UN says",2024-09-25,2021-11-05,By Katie Silver,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-59172665,"Global food prices have hit the highest level in over a decade after rising by more than 30% in the last year, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) says. The agency's figures highlighted the soaring cost of cereals and vegetable oils around the world. Vegetable oil prices hit a record high after rising by almost 10% in October. Disruptions to supplies, high commodity prices, factory closures and political tensions are helping to push up prices. The FAO said its measure of cereal prices was up by more than 22% compared to a year earlier. The price of wheat was one of the major contributors to this rise, up almost 40% in the last 12 months after major exporters - such as Canada, Russia and the US - had poor harvests.  ""In the case of cereals, we're facing a situation where one could say it's climate change which is ultimately causing falling production,"" Peter Batt, an agribusiness expert at Curtin Business School told the BBC. ""We've had pretty bad years [of harvests] in a lot of places.""  The FAO said its index of vegetable oil prices was pushed up by rises in the cost of palm, soy, sunflower and rapeseed oils.  In the case of palm oil, prices have been driven higher after output from Malaysia was ""subdued"" due to ongoing shortages of migrant workers, the FAO said. Labour shortages are helping to push up the cost of production and transportation of food in other parts of the world too. Mr Batt said: ""The other problem that has emerged is getting the product out. For example, here in Australia we've had a lot of ships arrive to take the food away but we can't get crew to come in because of Covid."" Shipping disruptions are also pushing up milk prices, with the cost of dairy products rising by almost 16% over the last year. Brigit Busicchia from Macquarie University said speculation on global markets is also contributing to price volatility: ""Since the 1990s, the deregulation of commodity futures trading has made it possible for institutional investors to enter this market on a large scale."" This is having a particular impact on countries which rely on food imports. ""Expect countries like Egypt or other Middle Eastern countries to experience tensions in their provisioning of cereals,"" she said. Ms Busicchia also highlighted that rising food prices are typically felt most acutely by the poor, as disadvantaged groups are pushed further into poverty and that this has the potential to heighten social and political tensions.

Volatility,Cardiff Airport posts £18.5m pre-tax loss,2024-09-25,2019-12-31,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-50955180,"Cardiff Airport has posted a pre-tax loss of £18.5m, nearly three times higher than the previous year. The Welsh Government-owned airport said global economic factors such as climate change, uncertainty over Brexit and rising fuel prices had had an impact on the aviation sector. However its turnover has risen by nearly £3m to £20.8m and it reported 15 months of continuous growth. The Welsh Government said the airport contributed £250m to the economy. Although the annual report focused on the financial year 2018-2019, outgoing chairman Roger Lewis noted the collapse of the Thomas Cook holiday chain in September had had ""limited impact"" on the 2019-2020 year with the loss of only 16,000 passengers. But he warned the coming year would see a loss of approximately 150,000 passengers because of Thomas Cook's demise, and the airport would ""seek opportunities to replace this operator"". He highlighted successes in attracting more passengers to the airport, with the first year of Qatar Airways' flights to Doha bringing 70,000 passengers during the 2018-2019 financial year and Flybe's business increasing by 4%. He also noted the package operator Tui had introduced an additional 100,000 seats for summer 2019. Passenger numbers passed the 1.5 million mark in May 2018 and summer 2018 was the airport's busiest in a decade. The airport was taken over by the Welsh Government in 2013. Mr Lewis wrote: ""While we were very pleased to note substantial continued growth over the reporting period, we also saw increased signs of major global economic factors such as the ongoing uncertainty over Brexit and concomitant sterling weakness, climate change and rising fuel prices impacting on the aviation sector."" He said in the light of ""continuing volatility"" in the global economy, and Brexit and currency ""uncertainty"", the airport had taken the decision to write down the estimated value of the airport's intangible assets - things such as intellectual property and brand recognition - by £9.3m. The airport said this was the main reason for the loss, although the write down is about half the pre-tax losses for the year. However, it has seen a large rise in a measure known as EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) by which airports are measured against one another from £7,000 in 2018 to £77,000 in 2019. The report noted the airport had ""invested heavily"" in its commercial operations at the end of the 2017-2018 financial year, increasing the size of the departure lounge and the departure terminal's food and shopping outlets, as well as offering a car park meet and greet service. It said: ""The business continues to see the benefit of increased commercial returns from these operations."" Huw Lewis, chief operating officer at the airport, said: ""During this period we have invested in our operations and prepared for taking over the operation of the St Athan airfield. ""We have increased our headcount by over 9% to meet the growing business demands and brought forward our commitment to pay at least the real living wage to all Cardiff Airport employees."" A Welsh Government spokesman said: ""Since our acquisition of Cardiff Airport passenger numbers have increased by 70%. ""The airport contributes a quarter of a billion pounds to the Welsh economy every year and sustains around 2,400 aviation related jobs."""
Volatility,Asia markets join global stock plunge,2024-09-25,2018-02-06,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42956234,"Asian markets plunged on Tuesday as investors dumped stocks following the biggest US market fall for six years At one point Japan's Nikkei 225 index was down 7%, but recovered some of those losses to close 4.7% lower. London, Frankfurt and Paris all fell sharply when they opened on Tuesday with new losses of up to 3%. In the US overnight the Dow lost 4.6%. The falls follow some good years for investors. In 2017 the Dow was up 25%, helped by a resurgent economy. Strong profits and low interest rates also underpinned the positive investment climate. This global sell-off began last week after a solid US jobs report fuelled expectations that the economy's strength was such the Federal Reserve would need to raise interest rates faster than expected.  The softness of markets over the last few days is down to one thing. As monetary policy begins its long journey away from the trillions of pounds of stimulus pumped into the system to keep the economic ship from the rocks, shareholders are beginning to wonder how much of their investments are in companies with strong fundamentals. And how much is simply holding up an asset bubble - frothy prices led ever higher in an era of ultra low interest rates and cheap money.  Fingers are hovering over the ""sell"" button. And once investors start looking at their portfolio and selling out of the froth, automatic algorithmic trading tends to ""chase the dip"". Read more from Kamal here: Jane Sydenham, investment director at the stockbrokers Rathbones, told the BBC the falls did not appear to herald a serious change of sentiment: ""It is always a bit too early to tell, but I think these recent market falls are in the nature of a correction.  ""What we have to remember is stock markets have had a very smooth ride upwards and we've not had a fall of more than 3% for 15 months. There's been a real lack of volatility, which is very unusual."" She added that bear markets tend to happen ahead of a recession and at the moment growth forecasts were being upgraded. Erin Gibbs, portfolio manager for S&P Global Market Intelligence, said: ""This isn't a collapse of the economy.  ""This is concern that the economy is actually doing much better than expected and so we need to re-evaluate."" One country whose immediate economic outlook remains stagnant is Japan. The authorities there said there was little chance of interest rates being increased. The Bank of Japan's governor, Haruhiko Kuroda, ruled out the possibility of raising interest rates in the near future. He said it was ""inappropriate"" to do so with inflation still about half its 2% target. But markets in Asia typically follow the lead from the US.  Elsewhere in the region, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index closed down 1,649.8 points - or 5.12% - at 30,595.42 and South Korea's Kospi index gave up 2.6%. Australia's benchmark S&P/ASX 200 lost 3.2%.  On Monday the Dow Jones Industrial Average index tumbled 1,175 points, or 4.6% to close down at 24,345.75.  The decline was the largest in percentage terms for the Dow since August 2011, when markets dropped in the aftermath of ""Black Monday"" - the day Standard & Poor's downgraded its credit rating of the US.  The drop on the Dow was closely followed by the wider S&P 500 stock index, down 4.1% and the technology-heavy Nasdaq, which lost 3.7%.  The White House moved to reassure investors saying it was focused on ""long-term economic fundamentals, which remain exceptionally strong"". Analysts say that in the short term, investors should be prepared for choppier stock markets. Joel Prakken, chief US economist for IHS Markit, predicts share price gains will be limited over the next two years. ""The difference between this year and last year is we're going to see more periods of volatility like this as the market reacts to higher inflation,"" he said.  ""We're just not used to it because it's been so long since we've had a significant correction."" However, he added that markets would need to deteriorate more significantly for him to start to worry about the broader economy. Asian markets, on the other hand, have benefitted from record low US interest rates in the last decade because money has flowed into Asia in search of stronger returns. Analysts say the expected rate rises could impact Asia over the longer term."
Volatility,Truss: Ground should have been laid for tax cuts,2024-09-25,2022-10-02,By Paul Seddon,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-63107649,"Liz Truss has admitted she should have ""laid the ground better"" for her mini-budget, after it sparked days of market turmoil. The prime minister told the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg she had ""learned from that"", but she was confident her tax cutting package would boost economic growth. She added a decision to cut the top earner tax rate was a ""decision that the chancellor made"". And she revealed it was not discussed with the whole cabinet beforehand. The cut to the 45p rate has provoked outrage from opposition parties, and concern from some Conservative MPs. Former minister Michael Gove said the cut displayed the ""wrong values,"" and signalled he wouldn't vote for it. He also said he was ""profoundly concerned"" about the decision to borrow to fund the tax cuts, calling it ""not Conservative"". The government's mini-budget included £45bn in cuts funded by government borrowing, and revealed the government expects its two-year scheme to fix energy prices will cost £60bn in the first six months. The announcements sparked days of turbulence in financial markets, with the pound falling to a record low against the US dollar on Monday, although it has since recovered. The rocky economic backdrop is set to dominate this week's Conservative party conference, Ms Truss's first as Tory leader, where she faces the task of reassuring her MPs over her approach to boosting the flagging UK economy. Speaking from the gathering in Birmingham, Ms Truss promised to win over ""the hearts and minds"" of Tory MPs to persuade them of her plan. In an interview for the BBC's Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg, she said she remained committed to her approach and she was ""confident"" better growth would result. ""I do stand by the package we announced and I stand by the fact we announced it quickly, because we had to act,"" the prime minister added. ""But I do accept we should have laid the ground better. I have learned from that, and I will make sure that in future we do a better job of laying the ground."" She also defended the decision to cut the 45p income tax rate for top earners, saying it ""raises very little"" and made the tax system more complicated. She added that the cut was a decision made by Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng - prompting former cabinet minister and Boris Johnson loyalist Nadine Dorries to accuse her of throwing him ""under a bus"". And Mr Gove, who has served in several cabinet roles in previous governments, expressed concerns about scrapping the top rate at a time when ""people are suffering"". Former deputy prime minister Damian Green warned a reception at conference that the Tories would lose the next general election if ""we end up painting ourselves as the party of the rich"". Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves accused the government of conducting a ""mad experiment"" with the economy, calling the market turmoil a ""crisis made in Downing Street"". Also speaking to Laura Kuenssberg, she said investors had been spooked by the ""sheer scale of the borrowing"" to fund the tax cuts, alongside the decision not to publish an official economic forecast alongside the plans. She added that the public would ""pay the price"" for the turbulence, and said Ms Truss had failed to understand the ""anxiety and fear"" about the state of the economy. Just a few weeks ago, this was a conference where many would have anticipated a mood of loyal celebration.  Yes, a government and a country confronting difficult times - but a party welcoming a new prime minister; relieved to have left the arguments of the collapsing premiership of Boris Johnson behind.  Instead, with nosediving opinion poll numbers and self-inflicted economic volatility, the mood here is bleak, the outbreaks of public anger illustrative of a deeper well of private anguish.  There are few things more dangerous for a government than a perception that senior figures don't know what they are doing and are not fully in control of events.  Some Tory MPs are already privately questioning how long Liz Truss might last in office; even more say they will not support elements of her budget, not least the tax cut for the highest paid.  Senior Conservatives recognise this is a moment of considerable jeopardy for a prime minister not yet a month in the job - and the next few days will be crucial in providing reassurance for the party and the country. In a bid to reassure markets, the government has said it will set out how it plans to lower public debt in the medium term on 23 November. Pushed repeatedly on whether she planned to cut public spending, Ms Truss did not say, but added she wanted to get ""value for money for the taxpayer"". She did not commit to raising benefits in line with inflation, saying that a decision would be made later this autumn. She also rejected calls to bring forward an assessment of the government's plans from the UK's budget watchdog, currently due to be published alongside the debt plan. She added that an assessment of the spending plans was ""not yet ready"". ""There's no point in publishing something that's not ready. That would just cause confusion,"" she added."
Volatility,Chance to reset economic policy - Lord Offord,2024-09-25,2022-10-16,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-63276360,"A Scotland Office minister has said the new chancellor now has a chance to reset the economy after the recent financial turmoil.  Scottish financier Lord Offord said mistakes had been made but backed the prime minister's emphasis on growth.  He said the mini-budget had moved ""too far, too fast"", and restoring stability was now vital. The Scottish government has accused the Conservatives of crashing the economy and worsening cost of living pressures. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said Liz Truss is as much to blame for the current volatility as her sacked chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng and she should ""carry the can"" for her actions.  She told BBC News: ""I think the only decent thing that Tory backbenchers can do now is call time on Liz Truss and this entire UK government, and allow people across the UK to have a general election."" Lord Offord, who is a parliamentary under secretary of state for Scotland, said Ms Truss should be given more time to deliver her vision, and stressed the need for stability in the face of international financial challenges. He told BBC Scotland's The Sunday Show: ""Mortgage rates are going up with overriding pressure in the world economy, particularly inflation. And that inflation is now heading at 10% in this country, and half of that is attributed to the energy crisis."" He said with hindsight, the UK government should have focused first on its measures for dealing with energy inflation, then come back with a balanced budget.  But the financier insisted the UK had become stuck with a low growth, high tax economy and that in the longer term this needed to be tackled. ""Our public services are growing at 3% per annum - the cost of them is growing at 3% per annum - our revenue is growing at 1.5%. Those sums don't add up. The long term direction of travel has to be that we get back to being a higher growth economy,"" he said. He accepted that measures to address low growth had to be introduced in a ""stable environment"" and in an ""orderly fashion"". ""The chancellor has been very candid. He says mistakes have been made, those mistakes have been rectified. We now have an opportunity to reset this on the 31 October,"" he said.  The UK government plans to deliver more details of its fiscal plan and accompanying economic forecasts on that date.  The new chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, has said every government department would be asked to make savings, but insisted it would be nothing like the period of austerity that began in 2010. Alistair Darling, who was Labour's chancellor at the time of the 2008 financial crash, said he did not think Ms Truss could survive as prime minister. He told BBC Scotland: ""I think she is finished. It is only a matter of time.  ""She was the author of this policy which has so spectacularly blown up. It is a self-inflicted wound."" Reflecting on his own experience as chancellor in a period of financial turmoil, he said: ""You have got to do more than people expect and you have got to do it more quickly than people expect. And, ultimately, you need to take people with you."" Mr Darling said replacing Ms Truss with another Conservative leader was not the answer, and he added his voice to calls for a general election. "

Volatility,Pound sinks as UK economic uncertainty rises,2024-09-25,2022-10-21,By Noor Nanji,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63340725,"The pound fell against the dollar on Friday as new figures showed a gloomy picture for the UK economy. Sterling slipped to $1.11, after rallying on Thursday as Prime Minister Liz Truss resigned. However, it clawed back losses on Friday evening and was back up to around $1.12 against the dollar. The volatility in the pound came after official figures showed government borrowing rose to its second highest September on record. Meanwhile, people are shopping less than they did before the coronavirus pandemic, according to figures from the Office For National Statistics (ONS). Retail sales fell by more than expected last month, dropping 1.4% and continuing their slide from August, the official figures showed. The pound's latest slide comes after a period of volatile trading for the currency. It plunged to a record low against the dollar last month, while government borrowing costs rose sharply in the aftermath of the mini-budget. Investors were spooked after the government promised huge tax cuts without saying how it would pay for them. Government borrowing costs also rose slightly on Friday. A fall in the US dollar against a number of currencies late Friday helped the pound regain some ground. But Jane Foley, a currency strategist at Rabobank, said much of the pound's moves are being driven by investors reacting to political and economic uncertainty in the UK as well as the negative economic data.  ""While sterling rallied yesterday on Truss's resignation, I think investors have realised today that it's not a guarantee that we'll get a market-friendly outcome from the Conservative leadership contest,"" she said. The Chancellor, Jeremy Hunt is due to announce plans for spending and tax on 31 October in his economic plan, which the Treasury confirmed was set to go ahead, although there are reports it could be delayed due to the leadership race. Ms Foley said this uncertainty was also weighing on the pound. ""The longer the uncertainty continues, the worse it's going to be for the markets."" A fall in the value of the pound increases the price of goods and services imported into the UK from overseas - because when the pound is weak against the dollar or euro, for example, it costs more for companies in the UK to buy things such as food, raw materials or parts from abroad. A weaker pound can push rising costs higher as well if companies choose to pass on higher prices to customers. For people planning a trip overseas, changes in the pound affect how far their money will go abroad. ""Consumers are now buying less than before the pandemic,"" said Darren Morgan, from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) which released the figures, said. He added: ""Retailers told us that the fall in September was partly because many stores were closed for the Queen's funeral, but also because of continued price pressures leading consumers to be careful about spending."" The cost of living crisis continues to squeeze household budgets, with prices rising faster than average wages. Inflation - the rate at which UK prices rise - surged to 10.1% last month and is expected to climb further. Mr Morgan, director of economic statistics at the ONS, said all types of shops saw sales drop with food stores particularly hard hit. The UK is borrowing billions of pounds to limit energy bill rises for households and businesses. Borrowing - the difference between spending and tax income - was £20bn last month, up £2.2bn from a year earlier, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. It is the second highest September borrowing since monthly records began in 1993, the ONS said. The figure is lower than in September 2020, at the height of the coronavirus pandemic, when the government was borrowing to fund schemes such as furlough, it said. But economists warned that government borrowing is set to rise further in the coming months. The Office For Budget Responsibility (OBR) makes independent forecasts on what impact government decisions on things like tax and spending will have on borrowing and growth. It is due to issue its latest forecast on 31 October when the chancellor is due to deliver his economic plan detailing its spending plans. Carl Emmerson, Deputy Director of think tank the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), said so far for the first half of the year government borrowing was almost as expected but warned it was likely to rise much higher. ""But this is little guide to how much borrowing will be over the whole of this financial year, as the huge cost of government support for household and business energy use only began in earnest this month."" The IFS predicts borrowing this year could reach almost £200bn, ""nearly £100bn more than the OBR forecast,"" he added. Michal Stelmach, senior economist at KPMG UK, also warned that government borrowing was expected to ""only worsen from October onwards"". This was to due the government's energy price guarantee for households and businesses, on top of the second cost of living instalment and the support for pensioners, he said. The Chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, said: ""To stabilise markets, I've been clear that protecting our public finances means difficult decisions lie ahead. ""We will do whatever is necessary to drive down debt in the medium term and to ensure that taxpayers' money is well spent, putting the public finances on a sustainable path as we grow the economy."""
Volatility,Tesco to go 'food waste free' by February,2024-09-25,2017-12-23,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-42464912,"No food fit for human consumption will be wasted by Tesco's UK stores by the end of February, the retail giant says. Chief executive Dave Lewis told the Daily Telegraph food waste had been ""talked about for years"" as he unveiled the plans for all 2,654 stores. Urging other chains to follow suit, he said edible food should be used for people, not go to waste.  Tesco, with all major UK supermarkets, has signed a commitment to cut food waste by one-fifth within a decade. The voluntary agreement is known as the Courtauld Commitment 2025.  Many supermarkets have introduced initiatives to tackle waste - such as moving away from ""buy-one-get-one-free"" offers that have been criticised for potentially increasing the amount of food thrown away in the home. East of England Co-op recently became the first major retailer to sell food beyond its ""best before"" dates. But Mr Lewis, who joined Tesco in 2014 from consumer brand Unilever, said the contrast between the amount of wasted food in the UK and the situation in countries suffering food shortages was ""really stark"". He said: ""Last year we sold 10 million tons [10.2 million tonnes] of food to the British public. But even if our waste is just 0.7% of the food, that's still 70,000 tons [71,100 tonnes] of food. ""And so long as that food is fit for human consumption, I'd much prefer it to go to people than animal feed or fuel."" The UK throws away 8.1 million tons [8.2 million tonnes] of food a year, according to the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee. Tesco says it cuts waste by selling surplus groceries with ""reduced to clear"" stickers and running a scheme giving unsold items to local charities. It uses an app, FoodCloud, to scan and upload surplus food that stores have at the end of the day, which is shared with registered charities that collect the food. ""That goes a long way in reducing charities' bill burdens, so they can spend the money on other things, like the cost of housing two more addicts, or providing much more needed services,"" Mr Lewis said. But he admitted it was ""impossible"" to prevent food surpluses in supermarkets. ""In retail there will always be some surplus food,"" he said. ""No matter how sophisticated the ordering systems are, it will be impossible to perfectly match the supply and demand for every one of our shops, 365 days a year, when there's so much volatility. ""Food waste has been talked about for years but if Tesco can make this work, with all of our different stores across the country, then why can't everybody,"" he added."
Volatility,Biggest UK commercial port hit by container logjam,2024-09-25,2021-10-12,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-58888552,"The UK's largest commercial port says the supply chain crisis has caused a logjam of shipping containers. The Port of Felixstowe, which handles 36% of the UK's freight container traffic, blamed the busy pre-Christmas period and haulage shortages. However, it said the situation has been improving over the last few days. Shipping giant Maersk told the BBC it is re-routing some of its biggest ships away from the port. The Financial Times first reported on Tuesday that Maersk was re-routing ships away from Felixstowe to other European ports, where smaller vessels will be used for UK deliveries. Lars Mikael Jensen, head of global ocean network at Maersk, told BBC Radio 5 Live's Drive programme that some of its largest 20,000-container ships were waiting outside Felixstowe for between four to seven days. ""We've taken those measures because we saw, because of the big ships, there is a limit to how many berths they can call in Felixstowe, and because its slower, it took longer to handle every ship,"" he said.  ""Instead of wasting time waiting, we progressed to the next stop, and arranged that the boxes are relayed from that port rather than wait for a week and then discharge."" Problems at Felixstowe come as retailers and other groups warn of mounting concern about stocks in the run-up to Christmas trading. The port has blamed several factors for the build-up of shipping containers, including the busy pre-Christmas peak, haulage shortages, poor vessel scheduling, and the impact of the pandemic. On top of this, there are a high number of empty containers currently sitting at the port. Felixstowe said it is asking shipping lines to remove them as quickly as possible. ""The vast majority of import containers are cleared for collection within minutes of arriving and there are over 1,000 unused haulier bookings most days,"" the port stressed. ""However, the situation is improving and there is more spare space for import containers this week, than at any time since the beginning of July, when supply chain impacts first started to bite."" Industry bodies estimate there is a shortage of about 100,000 drivers with several sectors from retailers to domestic refuse collection affected. The government recently drafted in military personnel to help deliver fuel and to issue emergency temporary visa to foreign drivers. The shortage has been caused by several factors, including European drivers who went home during the pandemic, Brexit, tax changes and a backlog of HGV driver tests. Tim Morris, head of the Major Ports Group, which represents port operators, said the industry had been had been hit by a whole host of issues, including Brexit border changes, global demand for goods travelling by sea, and the pandemic.  ""It has not been easy and there have been times of real stress on the ports system,"" he said. ""Ports have taken significant action to respond to the challenges and build resilience."" The problem is not just confined to the UK. Ports across the world have also suffered significant delays. Retailers have highlighted particular issues in China and east Asia, where pandemic restrictions and poor weather conditions have affected shipping. Sarah Treseder, chief executive of the trade group UK Chamber of Shipping, said there are reports of dozens of ships forced to wait outside ports in America and Asia. ""We anticipate the disruption will continue while the underlying market volatility stabilises,"" she said."
Volatility,UK stock market slips amid Brexit turmoil,2024-09-25,2018-11-16,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46233111,"The UK stock market has slipped lower amid the political fall-out from Theresa May's Brexit plan. The FTSE 100 share index ended 0.3% lower at 7,013.88, with shares in UK-focused stocks such as banks and housebuilders continuing to slide. However, the pound - which suffered its biggest fall for two years on Thursday - has stabilised. Sterling was up 0.6% against the dollar at $1.2846, although it slipped 0.2% against the euro to €1.1258. Despite the Prime Minister announcing on Wednesday that she had secured cabinet backing for the draft Brexit agreement with Brussels, the resignations of Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab and Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey on Thursday rattled markets. On Thursday, the pound registered its highest volatility since the referendum in June 2016 as it fell 1.7% against the dollar and dropped 1.9% against the euro. In the absence of any further resignations, the pound stabilised on Friday. But the stability may not last, analysts said. ""As long as 'no deal' remains as likely as it is, there is a risk of a sterling depreciation spiral that is self-intensifying,"" said Ulrich Leuchtmannan, a foreign exchange strategist at Commerzbank. ""Sterling volatility has woken up from its 100-year slumber and is likely to remain reactive."" Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the pound was a barometer for the prospects of the UK economy. ""Every time we see a likelihood of a bad Brexit risk... the currency sells off,"" Mr Khalaf said. The fall in the pound on Thursday which was the largest percentage fall in the currency since the vote to leave the EU in June 2016, when the pound slumped by 9.1% against the dollar.   That move was even greater than the slump on 21 October 2008, when the then governor of the Bank of England. Mervyn King, said the financial crisis meant the UK economy was heading into a recession. James Bevan, chief investment officer at CCLA Investment Management, told the BBC's Today programme that there were some ""interesting fundamentals"" affecting the pound at present. Among them are the slower economic growth in the UK than the EU and the US, which means that interest rates in the UK may not rise as quickly as those in other parts of the world. This makes the pound less attractive to investors.  The FTSE 100 share index lost ground on Friday, ending 0.3% lower at 7,013.88, while the FTSE 250 - which is generally regarded as a closer barometer of the UK economy - also fell 0.4% to 18,589.09. Mr Khalaf said the index of the biggest 100 companies on the stock market was protected from bigger falls by companies with large international operations. ""If you look at the headline performance of the market, the benchmark index, it hasn't really moved,"" said Mr Khalaf. For instance, the biggest companies in the index, Shell and HSBC, both have large overseas operations that generate revenues in currencies such as dollars and euros which are worth more as the pound falls. During Thursday, shares in companies that are heavily exposed to the UK economy saw the biggest falls, with housebuilders and banks being particularly hard hit. Royal Bank of Scotland fell over 3%, housing firms Persimmon and Taylor Wimpey fell over 2% and 1% respectively while Barratt Developments lost 0.5%. Mr Khalaf calls such companies the ""Brexit beasts"" - ones which are more closely linked to the UK economy. He gave the example of Lloyds Banking Group which was making a loss in 2011 and now makes billions of pounds of profits but is trading at a lower share price. RBS is also being knocked by the possibility that if there was a general election and the Labour party took power, the bank could be fully nationalised.  Big businesses have been generally supportive of the draft Brexit agreement published on Wednesday. The CBI's Chairs' Committee - the body's most senior policy-making committee - said it represented ""hard-won progress"". It said the agreement had two essential economic benefits which must be achieved: avoiding a no deal cliff edge by delivering transition, and opening a route to a good long-term trade deal. ""The real life implications for people and regions across the UK are what really matter. Business urges all involved to assess the way forward on this basis,"" it added in a statement. Earlier, Warren East, chief executive of engineering company Rolls-Royce, told the Today programme that time was running out and that any deal was better than leaving the EU without an agreement. ""I would, as a business leader, like to see politicians on both sides of the fence get on and negotiate a practical deal that works for business,"" he said. Eyes are on businesses such as Rolls-Royce, which operate a ""just-in time"" model where parts arrive in the UK from across the EU as they are needed. The head of the Co-operative Group has warned that availability of fresh food from both the UK and abroad could be hit by a no-deal Brexit. Steve Murrells told BBC Radio 5 live that stockpiling was not an option as ""there is not enough chilled capacity to do it""."
Volatility,Greens target fundamental reform of energy system,2024-09-25,2022-03-12,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-60720409,"The Scottish Greens have targeted a ""fundamental"" reform of the country's energy system to ease fuel poverty and reliance on fossil fuels. Co-leader Patrick Harvie told the Green conference in Stirling that funding would be targeted at insulating homes and people struggling with their bills. The party has now been in partnership government with the SNP for six months. Mr Harvie said the war in Ukraine and sanctions on Russia underlined the need to reduce reliance on oil and gas. Co-leader Lorna Slater said there was ""far more to come"" from the Greens in government, with policies aimed at boosting wind farm capacity and recycling. Both leaders also focused their speeches on the war in Ukraine, with Mr Harvie saying it was vital that words of solidarity translated into real action. And Ms Slater called for barriers to refugees entering the UK to be dropped, saying: ""Let them in. No excuses, no obstacles, no delays. Let them in now."" The UK government is due to set out details of a scheme which will allow people to welcome Ukrainians fleeing the conflict into their homes next week. The two leaders are both ministers in Nicola Sturgeon's government, courtesy of the co-operation agreement the Greens and SNP signed six months ago. They set out policies they aim to bring to fruition in the coming months and years, with Mr Harvie saying his party's policies could help ""make us safer from environmental collapse, from geopolitical threats, and from the volatility of energy costs"". He said Scotland must be insulated against the cold, but also against ""the blight of fuel poverty and against reliance on turbulent fossil fuel markets which bloat brutal regimes and destroy our planet"". Mr Harvie highlighted funding for fuel poverty schemes and efforts to improve energy efficiency, but also called for longer-term changes. He said: ""Our energy system needs to be transformed. The real answer to fuel poverty and energy insecurity lies in more fundamental reform - how energy is provided and how our homes, workplaces and community buildings are heated and powered."" Meanwhile, Ms Slater has announced that the government will bring forward a Circular Economy Bill which would ban shops from destroying unsold goods. She said: ""That isn't something that we could have done from the backbenches. It is the difference between opposition and government.  ""It is the difference between calling for something to be done and being able to directly deliver it."" The Greens have entered government at a strange and turbulent time in the world. This hybrid conference was partly hosted online, in a nod to the ""new normal"" way of life in the age of Covid-19. And the speeches opened and closed with talk of the war in Ukraine, with calls for more to be done to help refugees. But being in power means the party feels it can take a hand in helping to shape events, and the actions which much follow words of solidarity. This is particularly the case in terms of domestic policy. Now, when Patrick Harvie talks about energy efficiency and insulation, he can announce funding which makes a difference to people's lives. When Lorna Slater talks about recycling and the circular economy, she can bring forward legislation to make it a reality. The Greens will hope their position in government means they can build a record of delivery - which could in turn help them win votes and a shot at more power in future."
Volatility,Are sanctions hitting Iran’s access to medicine?,2024-09-25,2019-08-07,By Anahita Shams & Reality Check team,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-49051782,"Iran says sanctions are preventing lifesaving drugs from reaching the country, despite special exemptions for medical supplies.  This is disputed by Washington.   ""The United States exempts medicine and medical devices for the Iranian people from US sanctions,"" says Brian Hook, the American special representative for Iran.  So how are sanctions affecting access to medicines in Iran? Iran produces most of its own basic pharmaceuticals - but when it comes to the most advanced medicines, it relies heavily on imports.  It's estimated that although only about 4% of its medicines come from abroad in terms of volume, the more expensive imported drugs make up about a third of the total value.  There is only limited data on drug imports and prices paid inside Iran but anecdotal evidence can give some idea of the situation. The BBC's Persian Service has heard from its audience about rising costs of medicines.  A sufferer of Crohn's disease described the difficulties of accessing vital drugs. ""I have to travel to other towns and cities to check if their pharmacies have the drugs,"" they said. ""Some of them do but the prices are so high that I cannot afford them."" The BBC also spoke to a pharmaceutical importer from inside Iran who said the past two years had brought shortages and price rises. Drugs for anaesthetics, cancer-treatment and diabetes were particularly hard to find, they said. In the past 12 months, the cost of health and medical services rose by 19%, according to official Iranian statistics. But these shortages and price increases could be for many reasons, not only as a consequence of sanctions against Iran. International sanctions were lifted in 2016 following an agreement with Iran over its nuclear programme, but in November 2018 the United States reinstated ""the toughest ever"" sanctions on Iranian industry and banks. It threatened heavy punishment and exclusion from the US financial system for foreign companies seeking to circumvent these restrictions.   However, exporters of humanitarian supplies such as medicines and medical devices - and the companies facilitating this trade - should not be punished by the US for doing business with Tehran.  ""The problem is that you need to find banks willing to keep open the business lines and compliance functions to process those transactions,"" says Richard Nephew, an expert on US sanctions.  ""Often, they're seen as not worth the headache... so there is a practical problem in getting banks to do it.  But can they?  Sure.""  Also, not all medicines or medical devices qualify for the exemption.    ""Trading humanitarian goods and processing payments with Iran remains complex,"" says Justine Walker, director of sanctions policy at UK Finance, which represents British banks.  ""Legally, medicines are not prohibited under sanctions. However, they do become prohibited if they are found to be going to a designated actor or entity."" These include Iran's major banks.  Official Iranian figures seen by BBC News show a snapshot of the past 16 months of overall Iranian imports of medical drugs and devices.  These imports reached a peak of $176m (£145m) in September 2018, then fell significantly.   By June 2019, imports of medical supplies had fallen by 60% to about $67m. This fall coincides with the imposition of US sanctions but the data is limited and it's not possible to say with any certainty that sanctions are responsible. There is also data available from the EU, a key trading partner with Iran. Since sanctions were imposed in November last year, medical and pharmaceutical sales to Iran fell at first before rising slightly in May.  This followed a period when trade in medical supplies fluctuated, reaching a peak in 2016 (when international sanctions were lifted) and then falling in the following two years. Navigating new regulations and incurring extra costs, for example by changing banks, makes trade with Iran ""daunting for smaller firms"", says Esfandyar Batmanghelidj, founder of Bourse & Bazaar, which tracks Iran's economy. The lack of foreign currency inside Iran and the volatility of the Iranian currency also make imports more expensive.  Iran has been calling for the urgent implementation of a proposed European plan to support companies wishing to bypass US financial restrictions. But this has proven complex and politically difficult to implement.   Read more from Reality Check Send us your questions Follow us on Twitter"
Volatility,Pound hits record low after tax cut plans,2024-09-25,2022-09-26,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63030208,"The pound has fallen to a record low against the dollar as markets react to the UK's biggest tax cuts in 50 years. Sterling fell close to $1.03 early on Monday before regaining some ground to stand at $1.08.  Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng has promised more tax cuts on top of a £45bn package he announced on Friday amid expectations borrowing will surge. The cost of UK government borrowing climbed and markets speculated about an emergency interest rate rise.  Some economists predict the Bank of England may call an emergency meeting as soon as this week to raise rates, to help stem a fall in the pound and calm high inflation.  If so, it would come less than a week after the Bank lifted interest rates by half a percentage point to 2.25% and before its next official meeting on 3 November. The Bank of England declined to comment.  Market-watchers now forecast that interest rates could reach 5.5% or even higher by next spring. The rate increase in September was the seventh in a row and took rates to the highest for 14 years. A further rise would increase monthly mortgage costs for millions of homeowners. If the pound stays at low levels against the dollar, imports of commodities priced in dollars, including oil and gas, will be more costly.  Other imported goods could also become considerably more expensive, further pushing up inflation which is already at its highest rate for decades.  And British tourists visiting America will find that their holiday money does not go as far as before sterling's slide. Neither the chancellor or Prime Minister Liz Truss would comment on the fall in the pound.  While worries about the UK economy have hit the pound, its value has also been under pressure due to the strength of the dollar. Other currencies have been falling against the dollar, and the euro touched a fresh 20-year-low against the US currency amid concerns about the risk of recession. Investors all around the world trade huge amounts of foreign currency every day. The rate at which investors swap currencies also determines what rate people get at the bank, post office or foreign exchanges. Many people don't think about exchange rates until it's time to swap money for a foreign holiday. When you travel abroad, things will be more expensive if the pound buys less of the local currency. However, a fall in the pound affects household finances too. If the pound is worth less, the cost of importing goods from overseas goes up. For example, as oil is priced in dollars a weak pound can make filling up your car with petrol more expensive. Gas is also priced in dollars. Technology goods, like iPhones, that are made abroad, may get more expensive in UK shops. Even things that are made in the UK but from parts that are bought abroad can get much more expensive. Read more here Commenting on the likelihood the Bank of England could raise rates before its scheduled meeting in November, former Bank deputy governor Sir John Gieve told the BBC: ""I'm sure they very much don't want to do that... because that is a sign of pressure. ""Emergency meetings are avoided if at all possible and I am sure they will try to avoid it."" Sushil Wadhwani, chief investment officer at PGIM Wadhwani and a former member of the Bank of England's rate-setting committee, said if he was still there: ""I would be tempted to announce an extra meeting in a week. ""The argument for waiting a week would be to give them time to properly assess the extra news. The reason for not waiting until November is that they are cognisant of the need to respond in a timely basis to the new developments."" He added: ""Of course, the Bank of England taking action is a second best solution. The first would involve the chancellor coming up with a credible fiscal plan which is blessed by the Office for Budget Responsibility."" On Monday, the cost of UK government borrowing surged again. Interest rates on borrowing over two and five-year periods reached 4.5%, the highest since the 2008 financial crisis, while rates over 10 years hit the highest since April 2010. At the weekend, Mr Kwarteng said there was ""more to come"" in terms of tax cuts after announcing a massive shake-up of taxes on Friday during a ""mini-budget"" to boost economic growth. Under the plans, which he hailed a ""new era"" for the economy, income tax and the stamp duty on home purchases will be cut and planned rises in corporation taxes have been scrapped.  As well as outlining £45bn in tax cuts, the government confirmed it would spend £60bn for the first six months of its scheme to subsidise rising energy bills for households and businesses. But that cost is expected to rise as the scheme to support households will last for two years. Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves described the fall in sterling as ""incredibly concerning"". ""We need to hear from the chancellor his plans to get a grip on the public finances because that is what is giving real concern to market traders"" and ""working people"", she added. The Treasury refused to publish a forecast by independent watchdog the Office for Budget Responsibility on Friday on the UK's economic outlook as well as future borrowing and debt.  BBC political editor Chris Mason said that while ministers were not saying anything publicly: ""The impression I am left with is they want to ride this out. They hope it is short-term volatility. "" However, he said one Conservative MP told him: ""This is very worrying. All the wheels could come off.""  Paul Davies, chief executive at Carlsberg Marston's Brewing Company, said the fall in the pound was ""worrying"" for the British beer industry, which imports hops from overseas. He said: ""Many of the hops used in this country are actually imported and a lot of them, particularly for craft brewers, are imported from the US, so changes in currency is actually worrying for industry.  ""Then of course people drink a lot of imported beers from Europe, and the euro vs the pound is also something we're watching very closely at the moment.""

Volatility,Bitcoin slides amid rollercoaster ride,2024-09-25,2017-11-30,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42178705,"The price of digital currency Bitcoin has fallen sharply in a period of wild trading since it passed the $11,000 mark a day ago.  Bitcoin is now around $9,600, down about 16% from the record $11,434 (£8,500) it hit on Wednesday. The digital currency is used by some people to pay for things online, but most users see it as an investment. On Wednesday, a Bank of England deputy governor warned ""investors should do their homework"" on Bitcoin. There are two key traits of Bitcoin: it is digital and it is seen as an alternative currency. Unlike the notes or coins in your pocket, it largely exists online.  Secondly, Bitcoin is not printed by governments or traditional banks. A small but growing number of businesses, including Expedia and Microsoft, accept bitcoins - which work like virtual tokens.  However, the vast majority of users now buy and sell them as a financial investment.  At its peak, Bitcoin had increased by 1,000% from the $1,000 value at which it started the year. Bitcoin is ""prone to wild swings"", partly because it is not well regulated and because there are fewer traders, said Dr Garrick Hileman of the Judge Business School at University of Cambridge. The trading over the past day ""was a rollercoaster like nothing I've ever seen,"" said Neil Wilson, a financial analyst at ETX capital in London. He said part of the volatility was due to small investors ""with no market experience"" buying and selling the coin. ""There is no way to discern what fair value is - it's so incredibly speculative and it is so new and not properly understood."" Critics have said Bitcoin is going through a bubble similar to the dotcom boom, whereas others say it is rising in price because it is crossing into the financial mainstream. On Thursday, Randal Quarles, the Federal Reserve's vice chair for supervision, warned that digital currencies like Bitcoin could pose ""more serious financial stability issues"" if adopted widely. Financial regulators have taken a range of views on the status of digital currencies and their risks. Sir Jon Cunliffe, the Bank's deputy governor for financial stability, said Bitcoin was ""not of a size that would be a threat to financial stability"" or a risk to the UK economy. But he also told the BBC on Wednesday: ""People need to be clear this is not an official currency. No central bank stands behind it, no government stands behind it.""  Bitcoin is ""closer to a commodity"" than a currency, with people choosing to invest and trade in it, Sir Jon said. Bitcoins are created through a complex process known as mining, and then monitored by a network of computers across the world. A steady stream of about 3,600 new bitcoins are created a day - with about 16.5 million now in circulation from a maximum limit of 21 million. Bitcoin and other digital currencies are coming under closer scrutiny due to the rapid price rise. The UK's Financial Conduct Authority warned investors in September they could lose all their money if they buy digital currencies issued by firms, known as ""initial coin offerings"". "
Volatility,50 Cent discovers his Bitcoin millions,2024-09-25,2018-01-25,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42820246,"50 Cent has discovered that he is a Bitcoin millionaire, thanks to some long-forgotten album sales. In 2014, he released the album Animal Ambition and became the first artist to accept Bitcoin as payment. The rapper received more than 700 Bitcoins under the deal, but then forgot about the cryptocurrency, according to celebrity news site TMZ. The hoard is worth $7-$8m, although the currency's price volatility means that could change fast. In 2014, one Bitcoin was equivalent to about $662, but was worth about $11,200 on Thursday according to Coindesk. ""Not bad for a kid from South Side, I'm so proud of me,"" 50 Cent - whose real name is Curtis Jackson - wrote on Instagram, confirming the news in a post that featured a screenshot of the TMZ article. 50 Cent also posted a picture of himself on Instagram surrounded by Bitcoins, with the caption: ""A little bit coin anyone? LOL. l know l make you sick but excuse me I'm getting to the bag.""  Over the last 12 months, several celebrities have been paid to promote and endorse various virtual currencies on social media. In September, Hollywood actor Jamie Foxx promoted the sale of cryptocurrencies on a trading exchange called Cobinhood. And in October, US rapper Ghostface Killah, of the rap group Wu-Tang Clan, co-founded Cream Capital - a start-up aiming to develop a network of blockchain ATM cash machines for turning cryptocurrencies into cash for withdrawal.  Recently, French reality star Nabilla appeared on Snapchat on 12 January to encourage her fans to invest in Bitcoin. ""Even if you do not know anything about it, it makes money without investing much,"" she said, according to French financial newspaper Les Échos.  But Nabilla's video caused concern at the French regulator L'Autorité des Marchés Financiers, which promptly tweeted a warning that people do not to invest in Bitcoin due to the risks involved. "
Volatility,Bank of England wasn't briefed on mini-budget,2024-09-25,2022-10-19,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63319567,"The government did not tell the Bank of England about its tax cut plans before the mini-budget, one of its deputy governors has said. In the event, the mini-budget sparked market turmoil, with the Bank having to step in to stabilise pension funds.  The Bank could have advised the government on the possible market reaction, Sir Jon Cunliffe said. The government was criticised for bypassing some independent scrutiny of its plans before making them public. The mini-budget, which was put forward by former Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng and Prime Minister Liz Truss, included huge tax cuts but it was unclear how they would be funded. This led to a sharp drop in the pound against the dollar, and spooked investors about government debt, leading to the risk of some pension funds collapsing. The Bank of England was forced to step in to buy government debt to stop a fire-sale by some pension funds of assets which could have led to their collapse. Following the market turmoil, criticism by institutions including the IMF, and a huge drop in the polls for the Conservatives, Mr Kwarteng was sacked by his close political ally Liz Truss. At a meeting with MPs on Tuesday, Sir Jon said the Bank of England had not been consulted on the government plans before they were announced. ""We did not have a full briefing of the package the night before,"" he said. ""Had they asked us what the market reaction would be, we would have interacted with them. ""But it is not our responsibility to give the government advice on fiscal policy. This would have been for the Treasury to advise on the market reaction."" However, he said ultimately the decision on how to proceed lay with ministers. At Prime Minister's Questions in the House of Commons on Tuesday Labour accused Ms Truss of ""crashing the economy"". The prime minister did not address the mini-budget, but said: ""Interest rates are rising across the world and the economic conditions have worsened."" However, according to experts including the Bank of England, the mini-budget on 23 September also had a significant impact on the financial markets. In a letter to MPs on the Treasury Committee on Monday, Sir Jon wrote: ""There has been a particular increase in volatility in UK markets"" and pointed out that: ""The five largest daily moves in the 30-year inflation-linked gilt, in data that dates back to 2000, have all been since the 23 September"", which was when the mini-budget was unveiled. Gilts are a form of IOU which the government sells to borrow money to fund its spending plans. A career Bank of England official like Jon Cunliffe doesn't overstate the situation. But the two key answers he gave the Treasury committee are very serious. He said that the Bank wasn't told about the unpublicised measures in the mini budget, and that had it anticipated a risk to financial stability it would have warned the Treasury. Those are serious because it had every reason to anticipate instability. The day before the mini-budget, the Bank had announced it would start to sell some of the £895bn of government bonds it had bought to try and keep the cost of borrowing down. When more investors buy bonds than sell them, prices rise and the interest rate - known as the yield - drops.  In 2020/2021, the Bank's presence as a buyer in the market was crucial in enabling Rishi Sunak to borrow more than £300bn in to support the economy through Covid, without any offsetting tax rises or spending cuts. The Treasury could borrow vast sums by issuing as many bonds as it liked to investors who didn't insist on higher interest rates to compensate for the risk of lending to a hugely-indebted government - because they could always sell the bonds straight away to the Bank. By contrast, when the mini-budget was announced, there was no such buyer propping up bond prices, and therefore keeping down yields, because the Bank had announced it was now a seller.  That led to chaos. But you only get to hear about potential unintended consequences of budget measures if you ask the people who know."
Volatility,What's knocked markets off course?,2024-09-25,2018-12-14,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46515773,"Just a few months ago, US financial markets seemed headed for a third year in a row of hefty increases. But shares have tumbled since October, retreating to lower levels than at the start of the year.  That decline continued on Friday, as weak economic data in Europe and China sparked a late afternoon sell-off, sending all three major US share indexes lower. The Nasdaq dropped almost 2.3%, the Dow fell 2% and the S&P 500 sank 1.9%. For those invested in US stocks, the double-digit gains in seven of the last 10 years may still feel pretty good. But as Wall Street debate turns to just when a recession might begin, many investors are bracing for a rough patch.  What's behind the shift in sentiment? At their peaks this year, the Dow and S&P 500 were up about 8% since the start of 2018. The Nasdaq had increased 15%. But the stock market surge was always a bit suspect. It outpaced other economic measures by a large margin and was driven by the tech sector, which accounted for roughly half of the gains on the S&P 500 up until mid-August of this year. Now some of the biggest winners - such as Apple and Facebook - have stumbled, dragging down the markets and making the weakness elsewhere more visible. All three indexes are off 10% from their earlier peaks - a decline often considered a correction. Until tech recovers, a broader market bounce is unlikely, said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at US Bank Wealth Management. ""Looking to 2019, volatility is likely to represent the norm rather than the exception,"" he says. ""By many measures, the degree of investment difficulty is on the rise.""  US central bankers have been raising interest rates since 2015, moving away from the unusually low rates put in place during the financial crisis as economic growth rebounds. Analysts are worried about how much more expensive borrowing might get - and whether companies and households will be able to handle the increased costs. Fears have been tempered recently by signals from the US Fed suggesting it may enact fewer rates rises in 2019 than previously expected. But some still worry about the risks from corporate debt levels, which have hit historic highs - with an increasing percentage of the loans made to companies with already large debt loads. US growth is expected to slow to 2.5% in 2019, down from about 3% this year, according to the IMF and Federal Reserve. Some closely watched industries and financial indicators are already flashing warning signs of a more serious contraction. In October, sales of existing homes had fallen more than 5% compared to 2017. Construction spending has started to slip and growth in consumer spending been less robust than expected. Meanwhile, business optimism is in retreat. Indeed, nearly half of US financial officers believe the nation's economy will enter a recession by the end of 2019, a recent Duke University survey found. Investors loved US President Donald Trump's 2017 tax cuts. But his trade policy has them tied up in knots. In March, Mr Trump ordered tariffs on foreign steel and aluminium, as well as on billions of dollars worth in annual trade from China. He's threatened more, including on foreign cars. The tariffs have already raised costs for US companies - and economists warn they threaten to slow growth, adding to recession worries. Markets aren't sure about White House strategy, and an ongoing investigation of Mr Trump's election campaign ties to Russia has only added to uncertainty emanating from Washington. ""If these investigations produce some sort of smoking gun that throws us into a constitutional crisis, that might prove destabilising,"" says Mark Vitner, senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities. The IMF expects the global economy to expand 3.7% in 2019, but the growth has become more uneven. The US Federal Reserve recently flagged issues in Europe, China and emerging markets as some of the biggest threats to the American economy, with Brexit high on the list. Indeed, as much as US indexes are down, financial markets elsewhere have dropped even farther.  The Global Dow is down around nearly 9% so far this year, and the MSCI world index is down about 8%. In Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 index has fallen about 6%; Hong Kong's Hang Seng index is about 13% lower in 2018. The Shanghai Composite has dropped more than 20%. The Stoxx Europe 600 is off almost 11%. France's CAC 40 has dropped almost 9%, London's FTSE 100 has declined nearly 11%. and Germany's DAX is down more than 15%. So stormy seas likely lie ahead."
Volatility,Crypto trader Coinbase worth more than oil firm BP,2024-09-25,2021-04-14,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56750102,"Cryptocurrency firm Coinbase, which runs a top exchange for Bitcoin and other digital currency trading, hit a market value of nearly $100bn (£72.5bn) in its stock market listing. Shares debuted on the Nasdaq at a price of $381, but later closed below $330. The initial valuation put Coinbase ahead of many well-known firms, such as oil giant BP and key stock exchanges. The listing was seen as the latest step toward cryptocurrencies gaining wider acceptance among traditional investors. The price of Bitcoin surged more than 300% last year - and has climbed even higher in 2021 - as firms including Tesla, Mastercard and BlackRock unveiled plans to incorporate digital currencies into their businesses. It hit a record of more than $63,000 on Tuesday, ahead of the Coinbase listing. Less well-known digital currencies have also made gains with Dogecoin, which was created as a joke, rising more than 70% to more than 13 cents. US-based Coinbase, which makes money primarily by charging transaction fees, has benefited from the soaring demand.  Founded in 2012, Coinbase had more than 56 million users across more than 100 countries and held some $223bn in users' assets at the end of March. It reported $1.8bn in estimated revenue in the first three months of 2021 - more than its total for all of 2020 - as interest in Bitcoin and other digital currencies boomed. Compared to 2018, when investors reckoned Coinbase was worth $8bn in a private funding round, the firm's value has increased more than ten-fold. Wednesday's listing was set to make Coinbase co-founder and chief executive Brian Armstrong one of the wealthiest people in the world. The 38-year-old, a former Airbnb software engineer, owns a roughly 21% stake in the company. For outside investors, buying shares in Coinbase is seen as a potentially less risky way to tap into the activity in the crypto market, without investing directly in Bitcoin or other digital currencies, which have attracted warnings from financial regulators. But Jane Foley, senior currency strategist at Rabobank said tougher rules, if enacted, could change the outlook for Coinbase. ""There does appear to be a little bit of a slow march towards acceptability,"" she said.  ""There's a lot of concern that at some point the regulators, the central banks, might just say, 'well, no,' and make this a lot more difficult and at that point many people could stand to lose a lot of money."" Last year, Coinbase's revenues hit $1.3bn, more than double that of 2019. Profits were $322m, compared to a loss of more than $30m in 2019. On Wednesday, the company's share price initially jumped, hitting a high of nearly $430 at one point. But it later dropped back, hitting a low of $118 before ending the trading session at roughly $328.  That would give the firm a valuation of about $86bn. This is a bit of a moment for crypto currency. Digital currencies have long been seen as a high risk bet for investors - a 'you only live once' investment. Over the years though, crypto has slowly gained some credibility - and has delivered astonishing returns for some investors. Several major companies have said they want to introduce crypto as a form of payment. But this is perhaps an even greater step on the road to crypto credibility. The attraction for investors is that it feels like a safer way to invest in crypto itself. Coinbase's market price will be linked to how well currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are doing. But the fact that the firm has such an range of currencies you can buy and sell means investors may feel they are more insulated from wild changes in the price of a single currency. The big worry for investors taking a punt on crypto is that authorities will move to limit or even shut them down.  Mining some digital currencies can be hugely environmentally damaging, and the currencies themselves have been linked to organised crime.  Coinbase, then, may be seen as a more acceptable place for funds to take a punt on digital currencies. Executives said the firm's performance would vary amid the swings in notoriously volatile digital currencies, but over the long term it was poised for growth. ""There's going to be volatility with new technologies and the companies associated with them. That's ok. That's a feature, not a bug,"" Coinbase president Emily Choi told the BBC. ""If you believe in the long term idea about digital value and what crypto assets create, you're just going to play this as a long-term thing."" Coinbase's market debut comes at a time when investors have shown high demand for newly listed companies, sending their valuations soaring at trading launches. The firm listed its shares with a sale of existing stock, rather than issuing new equity as would occur in a more typical initial public offering. "
Volatility,How can the government solve the energy crisis?,2024-09-25,2022-01-05,By Simon Jack,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-59883892,"Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng will chair a virtual meeting with the energy industry later on Wednesday to consider alternatives to tackle what energy providers and others are describing as a national crisis.  There are three fronts to this crisis: household consumers, business customers and the energy companies themselves.  The government has made clear its number one priority is domestic consumers, although that is arguably the least urgent of the three. Most consumers are protected by the continued existence of the energy price cap. It may have bankrupted two dozen providers, forced to buy wholesale gas at higher prices than they are allowed to sell it, but it means that millions of bills are capped at £1,277 for normal domestic usage.  That current level will remain in place until 1 April, but the new cap level will be announced in early February.  This is the deadline that government officials are working to when trying to figure out how to protect consumers, who will struggle to pay their bills when the cap rises by an estimated 50% or more.  The options include abolishing VAT of 5% on energy bills. This would be quick and easy, but is considered a blunt instrument, as it would provide support to well-off customers who don't need it. For those that do need it, 5% of a possible £700 price rise is pretty small.  The government could temporarily suspend the additional levies on bills that fund green policies. That would be a tricky sell in some quarters, after the UK hosted a major global climate summit, and these levies are designed to reduce dependence on volatile fossil fuels. This option is, however, gaining support among some Conservative backbench MPs.  One other option is to extend and expand the Warm Homes Discount. Currently, customers in receipt of certain benefits can apply for a one-off payment of £140.  That could be increased. When quizzed on Tuesday on what the government was considering, the prime minister reached for his energy briefing crib sheet and this was on the list.  Another option - suggested by the industry - would be to subsidise the energy companies themselves, by establishing a fund or facility which would allow them to draw down government cash when wholesale prices were very high and then pay it back when prices dipped again.  This would smooth out price spikes and would have the added benefit, energy providers argue, of preventing further providers going bust.  Even those that have survived so far have warned that their ability to insure themselves by buying the gas they need in advance is beginning to unravel, as higher prices are outlasting their advance orders and exhausting their day-to-day cash.  Officials seem cool on this idea at the moment. Any such fund would need Treasury approval and no concrete proposal has yet made it to the chancellor's desk.  Potentially, the most urgent problem is the needs of businesses who use a lot of energy and are not protected by any cap.  There were dread warnings from those firms before Christmas that many would imminently go bust, but government sources point out that so far, Armageddon has not materialised.  Government officials also point to the extreme volatility of wholesale prices. On Christmas Eve, prices hit 450p a unit - nine times the level last year. On Tuesday they were back to 150p.  It is hard and expensive to design a mechanism to accommodate wild swings which are affecting energy markets and their customers everywhere - not just in the UK.  Expectations of any breakthrough on Wednesday have been played down by people close to Mr Kwarteng.  "
Volatility,Bitcoin sets fresh records after Musk investment,2024-09-25,2021-02-09,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-55984393,"Bitcoin has hit record highs for a second day after Elon Musk's car company Tesla said it had bought about $1.5bn (£1.1bn) of the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin rose above $48,000 (£34,820) before falling back, but it remains about 25% higher than a week ago. Some investors took Tesla's move as a signal that Bitcoin would become a mainstream financial asset. However, there was some criticism about a green car firm investing in such an energy intensive currency. Bitcoin currently uses more energy than Argentina every year, according to analysis from the University of Cambridge. Production of the cryptocurrency, known as ""Bitcoin mining"", needs energy-hungry computer hardware and ever-greater amounts of processing power. Mike Butcher, an editor at news website Techcrunch, tweeted: ""Tesla: Sells carbon credits to buy Bitcoin, which requires as much energy (not always Green energy) as a small country to mine."" Bitcoin is a form of digital money. This means it doesn't have a physical form. Instead, units of digital currency are traded over a computer network. It operates over a global network with thousands upon thousands of nodes - a machine within a network like a computer or some other device - which together process and store transactions. Explaining its investment on Monday, Tesla said that it wanted to maximise returns on cash lying dormant in the company's accounts. It also expects to accept payment for its electric cars in Bitcoin in future.  The moves sparked market interest which carried on into Tuesday. Shares of companies that provide trading platforms for Bitcoin and the technology to mine the cryptocurrency have surged in China, South Korea and Australia, and big computer chip-making firms such as SK Hynix also rose. The cryptocurrency has already risen in value by 62% this year, on top of a 300% rally in 2020, as investors search for alternative assets at a time when interest rates in many countries are at record lows. Bitcoin has had some interest from big investment firms, including Blackrock, which recently changed a handful of investment mandates to allow some of its funds to invest in the currency. However, central banks remain sceptical about the cryptocurrency. In October, Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey cautioned over Bitcoin's use as a payment method, saying it lacked ""intrinsic value"" unlike cash or gold.  Some institutional investors are also wary of the price volatility of Bitcoin. Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth, said: ""The average institutional investor is shaking their head. ""For these folks who are believers in cryptocurrency, [Tesla's investment] gives them another layer of support that crypto is the future."" But Bitcoin scepticism does not mean that central banks and regulators are against digital currencies per se. In China in particular regulators are starting to embrace issuing their own digital currencies for everyday use."
Volatility,Mortgage safety net 'disappearing',2024-09-25,2017-12-11,By Kevin Peachey,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42311583,"Ministers should consider strengthening the safety net for homeowners struggling to pay their mortgage, a report suggests. Help for this group introduced in response to the financial crisis will be largely withdrawn by 2022. Academics, commissioned by lenders' trade body UK Finance, said the government should review its position. However, mortgage applicants must now prove they have a buffer to deal with money shocks and rising interest rates.  Various schemes have been in place to help those facing arrears or, ultimately, repossession of their property if they face financial difficulties. One of the major schemes is Support for Mortgage Interest, which helps those on certain benefits, owing to their low income, to receive help to meet the interest payments on a mortgage. Next year, this will be replaced by a loan.  The Universal Credit benefit system, which merges various working-age benefits, also has less mortgage support for those in low-paid or part-time work than the current system of tax credits and other welfare. The UK Finance report said: ""It is now evident that by 2022, there will only be limited government financial support for home buyers in distress, and that will mainly be in the form of loans for those not in work."" Instead, borrowers and their lenders would be expected to come to an arrangement on mortgage payments. ""Recognising the relatively open nature of the UK mortgage market and the continued volatility of our housing market, this report suggests it would be timely for government to review the homeowner safety net situation systematically and comprehensively,"" the report concludes. Low interest rates and a less aggressive stance by lenders have meant comparatively few people have lost their homes in recent years. Fewer homes were repossessed last year than in any year since 1982, but lenders have warned that mortgage rates will not always be so favourable. Financial information service Moneyfacts said that even the recent rise in the Bank rate from 0.25% to 0.5% had not been felt by all variable mortgage holders, with the average rate rising by only 0.14%. However, there is widespread expectation that mortgage rates will not get any cheaper. In response, the UK Finance report said: ""Households have become very used to enjoying low and falling mortgage rates and many have extended their secured and unsecured debt despite static wages. The Bank of England rightly reminds us that this poses significant risks."" Stricter regulation means that mortgage applicants must prove they can deal with rising interest rates, but the report suggests that this will not cover all homeowners, nor would it protect everyone who has a financial shock, such as a sudden drop in income. It suggests that Universal Credit could be beefed up to help some of those struggling with their mortgage while in low-paid work."
Volatility,The last hours - the election conclusions,2024-09-25,2017-06-07,By Laura Kuenssberg,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2017-40184817,"Caveat, caveat, caveat, and in case you haven't realised the point I'm trying to make yet, here is another caveat. Elections matter because they determine all our futures based on the decisions made by millions of people in the privacy of the polling booth. The results are not based on what the pollsters say, nor entirely on what happens in the rough and tumble of election campaigns, nor what any journalist or pundit says. Nor is the outcome in a time of political volatility predictable in any traditional sense.  So, anyone now making guesses about the final outcome of the election is doing just that, guessing, even if those guesses are of the most informed kind.  With those caveats in mind though, we have spent the last few weeks travelling the country with political leaders, talking to voters, and also talking to dozens of candidates who have been on the doorstep trying to secure the vote for their parties. And it is worth exploring the broad conclusions that many of them share. The first point worth making is that generally, most of them share the same view of the big picture. Irrespective of the Tories' dispiriting campaign, irrespective of the very obvious enthusiasm shown by many thousands of Jeremy Corbyn's supporters, experienced campaigners across the political spectrum believe the Conservatives are almost inevitably going to be the largest party.  Even the inner core of Mr Corbyn's supporters don't really believe the overall outcome is very likely to be different. And the London Bridge attacks make it difficult for any of the political parties to shift the debate beyond security or Brexit, or build new momentum in these closing hours.  One cabinet minister did suggest privately, ""it is possible"" that they might not end up being the largest overall party, but ""when you get down to Brexit it's a yes, and it's all down to Theresa May"". Without question though, there has been a hardening of what had felt like a super soft Labour vote. The local election results suggested that it wasn't just UKIP voters likely to make the switch to the Conservatives, but normal Labour voters who were willing to make the jump straight across.  Again and again, whether in Wales, or the Midlands, or the North East, we heard voters say ""I'm normally Labour, but…"" contemplating voting Conservative for the first time. That was certainly partly down to the public perception of Jeremy Corbyn. Labour campaigners reported a vitriolic reaction to Jeremy Corbyn in many places. One candidate texted in shock to say, ""you can't overestimate how unpopular he is on the doorsteps"".  Labour, Tory, SNP, or Lib Dem we heard this time and again. Whatever the picture the national polls suggest, some Labour candidates still believe their party could be looking at a dreadful set of results with the party crashing to well below 200 seats.  Most we've spoken to believe the party will go backwards, the question is by how much.  There has been a hardening of the Labour vote since the opening days of this battle, but as one source puts it the party's view was ""we started 90 seats behind"".  Another senior source says ""the scale of the drop in our support feels bigger than the scale of the recent increase, while the Tory vote has grown and the Lib Dems have disappeared"". But one look at the thousands of rain soaked supporters in Gateshead, students climbing up trees to see the Labour leader over the crowds in Leeds, queues outside so many of the venues where he has appeared, tells you that he has massively enthused some voters, particularly students and the young. Over the course of the campaign it's been Labour with most of the momentum, the more enthusiastic crowds, and the more radical agenda.   Nearly every private conversation with candidates reveals this too. There's been surprise in Tory ranks that the overall  tone of the campaign has been a positive for Mr Corbyn, rather than the onslaught they expected and sought to promote with highly personalised attacks from the get go. And for the large number of Labour doubters, there's been disbelief at how he has performed. For many of his supporters however, this is what they always believed could happen. When his policies got more exposure, and more people saw him in the context of a campaign, more and more voters would be drawn to his radical offer. But excited crowds don't translate directly into election victories. In the Scottish referendum for example, it was those campaigning for independence who had the excitement, the energy, the visible drive, yet they lost by 10 points. At this point in the General Election in 2015, it was Labour campaigners with hope in their eyes, Ed Miliband's team joking privately about giving out invites to Chequers. Yet the party went backwards.  What do the parties themselves really think is going on? Remember they have their own huge swathes of data gathered door-knock by door-knock that informs their decisions. The most basic of all - where it is worth turning up to campaign. Parties don't traditionally send their leaders to places where they think they have no chance of winning, or where they don't think they are in danger of losing. Essentially, leaders only go to seats that are in play. So consider the pattern of where Mr Corbyn has been visiting - the huge crowds have often been in Labour-held seats. For perhaps the biggest clue in this election look at the trail of the leaders' visits themselves. Jeremy Corbyn has been to 63 seats - 27 Labour including 20 safe seats, 34 Tory seats, 1 SNP and 1 Liberal Democrat. By contrast, Theresa May has visited 62 seats - 41 of them Labour, 15 Tory, 5 SNP and 1 Liberal Democrat. She has been to no safe Tory seat other than her own constituency. The heavy hint from those choices tell you who is playing an attack game, and who is trying to defend their ground.  Indeed one source at the top of the Labour Party told me there are only two seats they believe that are seriously in contention as Labour gains. That is hardly the position of a party that really believes it is in the ascendance. The party's ultimate vote share is a separate question. But in a first-past-the-post system, if Labour wants to inflict damage on the Tories they need to protect seats in the North and make gains in the Midlands. Beyond what the national polls suggest, there is not much convincing evidence that suggest that is what's going on. One senior source suggests Mr Corbyn has sewn up the ""trendy left"". But it's hard to identify how far his appeal has really stretched beyond that in the places where it counts. Still, last night in Birmingham, we've witnessed what was probably one of the biggest political events in decades. Jeremy Corbyn speaking to a crowd in Birmingham, cheered again and again, watched on live screens by many more thousands of voters in five other cities around the country.  Just as when he won the leadership of the Labour Party, his candidacy, and his promises have excited voters for whom the standard political offer of recent years has come up woefully short. For Labour candidates who see this election and its expected result as an opportunity to end his control of the party that enthusiasm is a genie that may be extremely hard to wrangle back into the bottle. Remember that, as with Mr Corbyn's election to the Labour leadership first time round, and the European referendum, we are living through times where traditional political rules are certainly frayed. And if young people defy expectation and turn out to vote in unprecedented numbers any result is possible. One cabinet minister told me today that if the Tories don't win, the polls are ""bonkers"" and voters on the doorsteps have been ""deceitful"" when reporting, whether enthusiastically or grudgingly, that they will put their cross in their box. Yet perhaps either way, the events of this campaign will be felt across the spectrum for years to come."
Volatility,Where are Scotland's inequalities?,2024-09-25,2023-08-09,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-66449845,"You don't hear much about 'levelling up' within Scotland.  It's a Whitehall term, dating back a couple of prime ministers. A political project to close the gulf of opportunity between London and its prosperous south-east neighbours and the parts of the country which feel - in many cases rightly - that they have been left behind. Some of the funds reach Scotland with a union flag prominently attached but most of the political project is aimed at parts of the north of England. England is a large and populous country with a sprawling confusion of weak local governance and that makes the devolution of power and distribution of funds a big task. In Scotland, we haven't heard so much about devolving power out from Holyrood.  Perhaps it's because of the party in government. The clue is in the name. They are not just the Scottish party but the Scottish National Party.  Sixteen years ago, the party's approach to local government began with Alex Salmond triumphantly signing an 'historic concordat' of mutual respect with councils. This was intended to be a contrast with the Labour-Liberal Democrat coalition years, when Holyrood had difficult relations with local councils. The agreement also brought in the freeze on council tax rises. The SNP government then applied the harshest squeeze of the austerity years to local authority budgets. That came with a return to ring-fencing for Nicola Sturgeon's priorities such as childcare. Under Humza Yousaf, the relationship has returned to an agreement on councils being treated with more respect, with less ring-fencing of budgets, an ""expectation"" that services will be ""delivered at a local level unless agreed otherwise"", and periodic reviews of council powers. The role of Holyrood in funding councils is partly to equalise across them, securing an equivalent level of public service whatever the tax base.  Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire complain they have long come out of that badly.  It's one reason the city centre has not benefited from the same regeneration and modernisation funds as poorer council areas to the south. Hence, the disputed efforts to catch up in Union Terrace Gardens and Union Street. Now, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has provided evidence that the north east has a case for more help from St Andrew's House in Edinburgh.  The region's relatively high employment and high earnings, fuelled by oil and gas, have slowed closer to Scotland's average. Hourly pay was once 30% higher than the Scottish average but the last decade has seen that drop to a 14% premium. The Highlands and islands have many pockets of employment in offshore work but it has not been doing as well as those on the other side of the Spey. Average hourly pay, which was 6% below the national average, has fallen to leave a 10% shortfall. Dumfries and Galloway has not had the same energy boom as the north, nor the benefit of as much infrastructure spending. It ranks as the lowest-paid council area in Scotland. At £16.10 per hour, that's around £2 below average, and £10 below the highest paying area, East Renfrewshire. The IFS story is about Scotland playing catch-up with the rest of the UK. And if you exclude London as an outlier because it distorts such figures with super-high pay for financiers, lawyers and oligarchs, much of Scotland has in fact grown to match the UK over the earlier parts of the past two decades.  From 2002 until around 2014, Scotland was catching up at a healthy pace. That stalled around 2014, when the global oil price tanked and both jobs and pay in the offshore industry also took a dive.  They've only partially recovered in the past three years of spikes and volatility and remain constrained both by uncertainty about the UK tax regime and the political uncertainty as to whether a new burst of investment will be encouraged or discouraged by Downing Street after the next election. The IFS says all of the slowing up of Scotland's national earnings growth can be explained by the slowing up of the nation's north and north east. Its analysis has positive things to say about some of those parts of Scotland which have struggled out of de-industrialisation in recent decades.  West central Scotland has done a lot of catching up in employment and earnings. It's been clear since at least the start of the century, even as oil and gas production declined, that Scotland was no longer the poor relation of the United Kingdom but in many ways typical of its economic performance. The IFS analysis underlines that. The report also puts a spotlight on poverty and differences in income inequalities, which have been flagged up as a top priority for Humza Yousaf. Scotland has had lower measures of inequality than the rest of the UK - in other words, it's less unfair - but drawing on data from before the pandemic, it was moving closer to the UK position. The household close to the top of the Scottish earnings spectrum (technically, the 90th percentile) has recently had income 5.7 times more than the person equally close to the bottom. The comparable figure for the UK peaked above a seven-fold multiple of earnings, before falling slightly.  Taking those two people as examples is intended to strip out the distorting effect at both extremes. The most recent available figures show less of a gap in Scotland between middle and high earners than in other parts of Britain but a similar gap between middle earners and those on the lowest income. Scotland's level of poverty, at 19%, is reckoned to be around three percentage points lower than the average south of the border.  Much of this is explained by housing costs. Scotland has a significantly higher share of renting households in social housing than the rest of the UK (59% to 45%) and those in social rented housing are paying lower rents than those south of the Border. The report uses statistics from 2017 to 2019 to show the proportion of children in relative poverty at 24% compared with 30% in the rest of the UK.  It signals that future studies can expect to see an impact on the poverty figures from that £25 weekly Scottish Child Payment for those on lower income, which was increased and expanded less than a year ago.  But it warns the Scottish government of limits to its largesse with welfare benefits, and also limits to the returns on increased tax rates for higher earners. Scottish government has been focussed on that sort of inequality and less so on the geographical variety. But of course, politics comes back into this when elections loom. And politics is geographical.  While the SNP is fighting to retain seats across Scotland, the IFS highlights what it calls ""a conundrum"".  Scotland's levelling up challenge is whether to focus more attention on helping parts of Scotland that have slowed but remain relatively well off, or on those that have been catching up but remain worse off and which are still recovering from the decline of older industries.

Volatility,'Surprise' pick-up in UK house prices,2024-09-25,2021-03-02,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56250728,"House price growth rebounded last month with the average value hitting a record high of £231,068, according to the   Nationwide. Prices were up 6.9% from a year before, compared with 6.4% in January, it said. ""This increase is a surprise,"" said the Nationwide's Robert Gardner, as price growth had been expected to slow ahead of the end of the stamp duty holiday. The holiday is due to end on 31 March although there have been reports it could be extended. The stamp duty holiday means the tax has been suspended on the first £500,000 of all property sales in England and Northern Ireland since July.  There has also been some relief from the equivalent taxes for property buyers in Scotland and Wales - which is also set to end on 31 March. An announcement on any changes in stamp duty could come in this week's Budget.  A mortgage guarantee scheme to help people with small deposits buy a property ladder is set to be announced in the Budget. The government will offer incentives to lenders, bringing back 95% mortgages which have ""virtually disappeared"" during the pandemic, the Treasury says. The Nationwide said house prices rose by 0.7% month-on-month, after taking account of seasonal effects, reversing the 0.2% monthly decline recorded in January. However, it added that the outlook for the housing market was particularly uncertain right now, and the market could slow because of the employment situation. Many workers remain on furlough, and some of those jobs may not return. Rival lender the Halifax said last month that the economic realities of 2021 meant activity would slow as the year progressed. Mr Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist, said: ""It may be that the stamp duty holiday is still providing some forward momentum, especially given the paucity of properties on the market at present. ""Shifts in housing preferences may also be providing a more significant boost to demand, despite the uncertain economic outlook. ""Many peoples' housing needs have changed as a direct result of the pandemic, with many opting to move to less densely populated locations or property types, despite the sharp economic slowdown and the uncertain outlook."" Samuel Tombs, economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics consultancy, said he had been forecasting a fall in house prices this year, but the Nationwide numbers have prompted a rethink. ""Our forecast for house prices to drop by about 2% this year now looks too downbeat, though we'll wait for details of the guarantee scheme to be released before providing new numbers."" However, Anna Clare Harper, chief executive of asset manager SPI Capital, said: ""Reduced stamp duty is not the only driver of house price growth since the strictest lockdown conditions were removed in 2020.  ""We also have cheap debt as a result of very low interest rates, which gives buyers a 'discount'; the release of pent-up supply and demand and desire to improve surroundings amongst existing homeowners.  ""There is also the 'flight to safety', since in times of uncertainty, people want to put their money in a stable asset with low volatility. These trends are likely to hold up throughout 2021."""
Volatility,Ukraine's economic secret: 'Engineering is in our DNA',2024-09-25,2018-01-18,By Christian Borys,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42403024,"As war raged in eastern Ukraine in 2014, Yevhen Vovchuk told his bosses at the IT firm where he worked in Kyiv that he was going on vacation.  Some probably thought the 28-year-old senior analyst, was heading off to a holiday resort to escape the chaotic country for a while.  Instead, Yevhen jumped in a truck and drove nearly 800km to join the fight.  ""I decided that I'd be more useful on the front,"" he tells me.  Like hordes of other young Ukrainian men and women, Yevhen linked up with one of the country's many makeshift volunteer battalions.  Soon enough, his bosses realised he wasn't coming back. But after a frontline car crash nearly took his life, his fiancée urged him to make his way back to civilian life. Eventually, he landed a senior role at Intellias, one of the country's fastest-growing IT outsourcing companies. Remarkably, IT companies like Intellias have flourished despite the past few years of volatility. In fact, the IT industry has proven to be one of the country's only economic engines, expanding dramatically over the past decade-and-a-half. ""It was a little above $100m in export in 2003 and had grown to $3bn in 2016, in a country with a nominal GDP [gross domestic product] still under $100bn,"" says Vasile Tofan, a partner at the Kyiv-based venture firm Horizon Capital.  A recent report from the consulting firm PwC shows that from 2011 to 2015, the share of Ukraine's annual economic output coming from IT outsourcing grew from 0.6% to 3.3%.  Indeed, the industry is now the country's third-largest export sector, behind the traditional titans of agriculture and mining.  So why have global giants like General Electric, Samsung, Boeing, Deutsche Bank, Canadian Tire, tech start-ups, and even American hospitals turned to Ukraine for their IT needs? Obviously, there are cost savings on labour. The average Ukrainian developer takes home $2,000 a month, which is 70% less than their US counterparts command. However, Yevhen's boss at Intellias, co-founder and chief executive Vitaly Sedler, believes there are three major reasons why Ukraine has emerged as a global leader in IT outsourcing. ""First of all, we're really close geographically and in the same time zones as clients in western Europe so we can work with each other very easily compared to Asian IT providers.  ""Secondly, we're close culturally to those clients, which makes it easier to communicate. ""And third, for us and other post-Soviet countries, we all have a very strong technical education.""  Perhaps most important is the sheer number of people working in the sector. There are now 100,000 to 150,000 engineers, and around 300,000 others, working in Ukraine's IT services sector. In the last four years, according to PwC, the number of IT specialists has more than doubled, from just over 40,000 to nearly 92,000.  In terms of available talent, Ukraine already outpaces its competitors in the region, including Poland and Hungary, and PwC believes the number of IT professionals will double again by 2020. Marvin Liao, a partner at the San Francisco-based venture capital fund 500 Startups who's spent considerable time in Ukraine, believes that the conflict with Russia has had a significant impact on the country's IT sector.  ""The natural leaning used to be towards the post-Soviet region, and for better or worse, since the war started, there's been a massive shift to leaning towards the West.  ""More people are learning to speak English, they are much more Western leaning, and that has changed the orientation of the ecosystem."" All of that has helped put Ukraine among the top 20 biggest exporters of IT services in the world. The growth in the sector has had some interesting benefits not only for Ukraine, but also for consumers worldwide.  The country is now churning out start-ups like Looksery, which pioneered the now ubiquitous real-time selfie filters and was bought by Snapchat for $150m, as well as Grammarly, an artificial intelligence start-up which recently raised another $110m.  Those companies, and others in Ukraine now attempting to follow suit, have the IT outsourcing sector to thank for parts of their success, says Yaroslav Azhnyuk, the 28-year-old Ukrainian co-founder of Petcube. His company has raised more than $10m to connect people with their pets through technology. ""The whole IT outsourcing sector is very fertile ground for any product companies,"" he says. ""Outsourcing fuels everything."" More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade: It is almost a farm system for product start-ups, says Mr Azhnyuk, where entrepreneurially-minded developers can learn how to programme, work in teams and earn good money - before leaving to take their shot at building their own firm. Horizon Capital's Vasile Tofan believes that Ukraine is now following a trajectory from IT outsourcing to product development, similar to those China and Taiwan took from tech manufacturing hubs to development giants. ""These used to be literally sweatshops, producing low-end electronics, and having a very low margin of added value,"" he says.  ""But as they started building more sophisticated things, at a certain point you end up with Lenovo, which used to be a contract manufacturer, buying IBM."" Although not all of those developers will succeed in their quest to build the next tech giant,  inevitably some will succeed, adds Mr Tofan, and continue to solidify Ukraine's spot on the global tech map.

Volatility,Bank rules in biggest shake-up in over 30 years,2024-09-25,2022-12-08,By Simon Jack and Tom Espiner,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63905505,"The government has announced what it describes as one of the biggest overhauls of financial regulation for more than three decades. It says the package of more than 30 reforms will ""cut red tape"" and ""turbocharge growth"". Rules that forced banks to legally separate retail banking from riskier investment operations will be reviewed. Those were introduced after the 2008 financial crisis when some banks faced collapse. The package of changes, the ""Edinburgh Reforms"", is being presented as an example of post-Brexit freedom to tailor regulation specifically to the needs and strengths of the UK economy.  However, critics say it risks forgetting the lessons of the financial crisis. Between 2007 and 2009 the then-Labour government spent £137bn of public money to bail out banks. Overall, taxpayers have lost £36.4bn on those bailouts, according to the latest estimate from independent forecaster the Office for Budget Responsibility. The plans to ease regulations on financial services are being described as another ""Big Bang"" - a reference to the deregulation of financial services by Margaret Thatcher's government in 1986. The government has already announced it will scrap a cap on bankers' bonuses and allow insurance companies to invest in long-term assets such as housing and windfarms to boost investment and help its levelling up agenda. Rules governing how senior finance executives are hired, monitored and sanctioned will be overhauled. There will also be new rules around bundling investments together into tradeable units - a process called securitisation. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said the changes would secure ""the UK's status as one of the most open, dynamic and competitive financial services hubs in the world"". The reforms ""seize on our Brexit freedoms to deliver an agile and home-grown regulatory regime that works in the interest of British people and our businesses"". Mr Hunt met bosses of the UK's largest financial services in Edinburgh on Friday to discuss the reforms. While in Edinburgh he was asked whether the reforms risked sowing the seeds of the next financial crash. He said: ""We have learned the lessons of that crash, we put in place some very important guardrails which will remain, but the banks have become much healthier financially since 2008."" However, Labour's shadow City minister Tulip Siddiq said the reforms would bring more risk. ""That this comes after the Tories crashed our economy is beyond misguided,"" adding that the reforms were part of a ""race to the bottom"". Green charity the Finance Innovation Lab said the government ""is taking major risks with the stability of the economy"". ""Weakening the essential protections that were put in place after the global financial crisis is an incredibly dangerous move - they help keep the system stable and our money safe,"" said its chief executive Jesse Griffiths. But Chris Hayward, policy chairman at the City of London Corporation, said the reforms would not weaken standards. ""It's a chance to actually grow our economy and I think we should be very excited about it,"" he said. After the financial crisis of 2008, when the government had to spend billions supporting the UK banking system, a new regime was brought in to increase the personal accountability of senior risk-taking staff.  It allowed for fines, bans and even custodial sentences, although there have been very few examples of enforcement.  But City insiders say a major disadvantage it imposes is the lengthy process of getting the movement of senior staff to the UK approved by the regulator - making London less attractive to foreign firms. After the financial crisis, large banks were forced to separate or ""ring fence"" their domestic banking operations - mortgages and loans for example - from their investment banking operations, which expose their own cash to market volatility and were deemed riskier. The cost of having two separate shock-absorbing cushions of spare money was seen by some as placing extra costs on the sector. Most of the big banks have spent billions on this ring fencing and are not calling for its reversal. The reforms of ring fencing are aimed at mid-size banks such as Virgin Money and TSB. The government also re-announced more freedom for the pensions and insurance industry to invest in longer term, illiquid assets - those that are hard to sell quickly such as social housing, windfarms, and nuclear - which the government will say helps their levelling up ambitions. It is worth noting that although this will be billed as a Brexit freedom, the EU is undertaking similar reforms. There was a nod to developing the UK as a centre for crypto assets, but with some caveats given the recent bloodbath after the demise of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX. Most financial industry leaders say they are crypto curious but do not feel the need to be first on this. ""Let the shipwrecks of others be your seamarks,"" said one.  London's position as the pre-eminent European financial centre has been dented in recent years. The UK's capital city briefly lost its long-time crown of most valuable European stock market to Paris before gains in the pound pushed it narrowly back ahead, while Amsterdam took the title of busiest European share dealing centre.  Leading hedge fund manager Sir Paul Marshall of Marshall Wace recently described the London financial markets as a ""Jurassic Park"" of old-fashioned companies and investors, and it has struggled to attract the world's fastest growing companies to list on UK exchanges, often losing out to New York, Shanghai or even Amsterdam."
Volatility,Foxtons says renters have to move out of London,2024-09-25,2023-03-07,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-64873369,"The boss of London's biggest estate agent has said the lack of rental options in the capital is so ""dramatic"" people will need to move further out.  ""We absolutely don't welcome this but people are going to have to move,"" Foxtons chief executive Guy Gittins told the BBC.   People who are being priced out will ""have to compromise on the property type or location,"" he said.  It came as Foxtons reported its annual profits had doubled in the past year.  Its lettings business saw particularly strong growth, with revenue up more than 17%.  Rising rents have been blamed for driving renters out of London. But Mr Gittins said a mismatch between supply and demand was the real problem.  ""The main issue is not affordability for the majority of the market - it's the stock issue,"" he told Radio 4's Today Programme.  Mr Gittins put the ""unhealthy"" supply and demand challenges down to recent policy decisions.  In its update to investors, Foxtons said the housing market relied on the availability of mortgage financing. It noted that interest rates had increased globally last year, with the UK impacted ""in particular"" by the government's ""mini-budget"" last September.  In the immediate aftermath, there was a drop in buy-to-let mortgage deals with many property investors reliant on interest-only mortgages hit by the volatility. Foxtons said this was likely to ""adversely affect affordability"" in the housing market.  He predicted the shortage in the market would continue for the next two to three years.  But Foxtons expects sales activity, which has slowed in the last six months, to improve in the latter part of this year.  ""Mortgage rates have started to reduce in recent weeks and buyer activity is picking up, which may result in a more favourable sales market in the latter part of the year,"" the company said in a statement. Rental site SpareRoom said the number of renters versus rooms available in London and its surroundings was higher this month compared to the same time last year.  According to its data, there were five active renters for each room available, versus two last March. The number was as high as eight per room in September 2022. ""The last 12 months has seen rents across the UK hit record highs and, unless new supply comes into market over the coming months, it's hard to see how those rents will come down,"" SpareRoom director Matt Hutchinson told the BBC.  ""High rents not only make it difficult for tenants who need to move now, it also means that many stay put to avoid paying more rent,"" he added.  Average UK house prices fell in the second half of 2022 as buyers were squeezed by higher mortgage rates and living costs.  However, fresh figures from the Halifax suggest the situation has improved somewhat. Average UK property values increased by 1.1% on a monthly basis in February, it said, accelerating from 0.2% growth in January. Kim Kinnaird, director at Halifax Mortgages, said: ""Recent reductions in mortgage rates, improving consumer confidence, and a continuing resilience in the labour market are arguably helping to stabilise prices following the falls seen in November and December. ""Still, with the cost of a home down on a quarterly basis (by 2.5%), the underlying activity continues to indicate a general downward trend. Earlier this month, property portal Rightmove found that house hunters are looking in a wider geographical area compared to before the pandemic, with increased searches for more properties in cheaper areas further afield. Guy Gittins took up his role last September, faced with the worst housing market since the financial crisis.  In an early move, he bought a fleet of green and yellow Mini Coopers for the estate agent's sales force. He also spent on sending around 100 of the firm's top-performing employees to the Italian ski resort of Courmayeur.  Mr Gittins started his career at Foxtons in 2002 on a salary of £22,000. He then rose to becoming the boss of rival agent Chestertons.  His current role has a starting salary of £450,000 and a maximum bonus one and a half times this figure.

Volatility,Soggy Spring means headache for farmers,2024-09-25,2018-04-12,By David Gregory-Kumar,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-hereford-worcester-43743279,"Actually soggy doesn't really do it justice. Depending on where in the Midlands you ask the question this is the wettest March for six or even eight years and it tops a pretty miserable start to 2018. All of this is having a huge impact on every sort of farming. This week I've been talking to farmers about the weather and the impact this snow, endless rain and cold have been having since the start of the year. No farmer has emerged unscathed. For horticulture and arable farmers the ground is often too wet to work. You can't take heavy machinery out on to wet ground without damaging the soil. So orchards are untended and crops remain unplanted or undeveloped.  On a farm outside Wolverhampton I saw green fields of oil seed rape that should be a good two foot taller and bright yellow by now. Seed potatoes remain unplanted and bare unploughed fields should be turning green with barley shoots. Farmers like to plant spring barley well before they hear the first cuckoo of spring. If the returning cuckoos beat them to it they actually call the result ""cuckoo barley"" and it has a reputation for being pretty ropey.  At the moment the problem for arable farmers is that they are a month behind with everything. The longer-term impact will likely be lower yields as the time for the crop to grow will be shorter.  Also any crops will have shallower roots as they've had less time to grow. So if things do warm up in the summer or we even enter a period of drought, arable crops will be less able to cope. For livestock farmers all this rain has caused real problems for lambing, with young lambs finding it hard to thrive in this weather.  For farmers looking to calve at this time of year they're finding it's just too wet to turn cattle out from their winter quarters. This in turn is pushing up the price of straw for bedding and feed in general as farms run out before they can get animals on to spring grass. The National Farmers' Union has reopened its Fodder Bank to try and help. So it's not been a great start to the year, actually it wasn't a great end to last year either.  Online, you can find people saying two ""extreme springs"" in six years is a worrying trend and a sign of volatility our government needs to think about as part of its post-Brexit agricultural policy. What is certain is that while warmer, drier weather will eventually start to arrive, all our farmers will be dealing with the fallout of our soggy spring for the rest of the year. "
Volatility,How cow poo is powering crypto mining,2024-09-25,2021-06-09,By Chris Vallance,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-57199405,"At Philip Hughes farm, near the Berwyn mountain range, not far from the Snowdonia National Park, in Denbighshire, cattle chew the lush valley pastures and flocks of sheep clothe the hills. In a green shipping container next to a large domed tank, a very different kind of farm also thrives in this idyllic landscape - a cryptocurrency farm. Philip Hughes's family have farmed the land for generations - but now he is turning his hand to mining, using powerful computers powered by renewable energy to generate new cryptocurrency. And that energy is derived, as Philip puts it, from ""cow muck"".  A big six-cylinder engine running at 500rpm turns methane given off by decomposing cow manure into electricity.  The process is called anaerobic digestion.  In the absence of oxygen, microbes break down the manure and produce methane, which can be combusted to produce heat and electricity, instead of entering the atmosphere where it would act as a powerful greenhouse gas.  What's left over can be used as fertiliser. About two-thirds of the electricity generated by the anaerobic digester helps power the farm and the farm's caravan park - but the remainder powers mining rigs, specialist computers about the size of a suitcase.  They are working on complex computations that serve to verify transactions and in return are rewarded with new cryptocurrency - a process that can consume large amounts of energy. Presently, they are mining Ethereum.   The income has been good but ""it does very much depend on what day you ask that question"", Philip says, with a nod to the notorious volatility of this digital product.  The value of Ethereum has fallen from over $4,000 (£2,800) in May to about $2,400 at the time of writing. Philip has also started leasing out his renewable energy.  The rigs powered by the digester are a mixture of those he owns and others belonging to third parties. At a cost of about £18,000, each rig is stuffed with ""lots of very powerful computer-graphics cards"", according to supplier Josh Riddett, who runs Easy Crypto Hunter, in Manchester.    And while the energy consumption of Ethereum mining is high, it is significantly less than mining Bitcoin and may yet be reduced further. Josh has been pitching cryptocurrency mining to small-scale renewable electricity generators for some time - he says his equipment is in 42 sites covering solar, hydro and wind-powered generators in addition to anaerobic digestion.  But some small-scale hydro projects are wary because they worry about the environmental impact of the cryptocurrencies.   And others doubt cryptocurrencies will be valuable for long enough or consistently enough to repay the considerable capital investment hydropower requires. Out of the British Hydropower Association's 290 members, the association's CEO Simon Hamlyn, knows of just two who are trying out crypto mining.  One has purchased a number of rigs to install at sites in Northern Ireland. But the other fell victim to a heist, when masked thieves crossed fields to break into the powerhouse and steal the rigs. Previously, the main mechanism for developing renewable-energy schemes was the feed-in-tariff, which paid renewable generators for the electricity they fed into the grid. The tariff started in 2011 and a boom in renewables followed - but the amount it pays has declined and it closed to new generators in 2019.  ""We're not going to be able to move to green energy unless the government revitalises the subsidy, or we start looking at alternatives,"" Josh says.  But renewable energy used to mine cryptocurrency cannot be used for other purposes, such as powering electric cars or heating homes.  If cryptocurrency is as socially valuable as any of those things, this might not matter - but for critics such as financial economist Alex de Vries, who writes the Digiconomist blog, it is a waste of green energy. ""The utility these systems can have is inherently extremely limited,"" he says.  ""If you look at Bitcoin, it can only process seven transactions per second at most - that's its maximum capacity.  ""You have to consider that a payments provider like Visa can do 65,000 transactions per second if needed.""  The decline of heavy industry has left some parts of the US with a surplus of hydroelectric power and the resulting cheap electricity has attracted cryptocurrency miners.  But communities that have experienced a ""gold rush"" of crypto miners have found it a mixed blessing, pushing up electricity prices.  And some, such as Plattsburg, have temporarily banned crypto mining.  Alex worries also about the limited lifespan of mining equipment, which he says can rapidly become obsolete, creating an e-waste problem. And rather than switching to renewables, many say it would be better to make cryptocurrencies more efficient - or stop using them altogether. In the UK, the Anaerobic Digestion and Bioresources Association says only a ""small handful of plants"" are exploring crypto mining.  And Philip is very aware his cryptocurrency business is based upon producing an asset whose value can change dramatically, sometimes in response to a single remark by Elon Musk or Donald Trump. If the market collapses, he says, he will put the computing power of the rigs to other uses. But some seem more speculative than others, such as setting the boxes of graphic cards to work rendering computer animation for film-makers such as Disney. His venture into crypto has sparked interest, though. Other farmers interested in the project have called him, Philip says. And it is ""a lot easier to run a computer, than a herd of cows or a flock of sheep"". "
Volatility,How Gen Z is hooked on cryptocurrency and NFTs,2024-09-25,2022-05-17,By Mariko Oi,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60566575,"The lure of making a quick buck has always attracted young people to invest in risky assets. For Generation Z, it is the volatility - and the decentralised nature - of digital assets such as cryptocurrency and NFTs which appeals. But they are unregulated, meaning there is little investor protection. ""All my friends were talking about [cryptocurrency] so one day I just decided why not just jump in and see if I can make some money,"" says 20-year-old Paxton See Tow. All he needed was his phone and trading thousands of dollars' worth of assets was only a click away.  Generation Z - also known as Zoomers - are the age group born between the mid-1990s to early-2000s. They grew up online, playing games and meeting friends virtually, so the transition is natural. Cryptocurrencies are digital currencies while a ""non-fungible token"" (NFT) is a way of owning an original digital image, touted as the digital answer to collectables. Just over a year ago, Paxton bought S$1,000 ($743; £739) worth of Bitcoin - one of the most popular cryptocurrencies - which gave him a 10% profit straight away. He decided to quadruple his portfolio. But then the price fell.  ""There's always the saying 'buy low, sell high' but I did the complete opposite. I let my emotions get the better of me,"" he says. He had lost a thousand dollars, on top of all the money he had invested, before he could pull his money out and re-strategise. For another, older trader, Kelvin Kong, the loss was much bigger. After making six figures in 2017, he lost more than half a million dollars the following year. ""I lost everything,"" he says. ""I thought I was the king of trading and my head got really big so I thought nothing could bring me down and I kept buying,"" he says.  In the end, he only had a few hundred dollars left in his bank account.  ""I think I almost went into depression. I had suicidal thoughts."" The boom in crypto and NFTs trading among young people worries him. ""A lot of them will lose money at the end of the day,"" he adds. But cautionary tales of people losing huge amounts of money don't seem to deter young traders.  For many, the first taste of digital assets are through ""play-to-earn games"" which reward players with NFTs and cryptocurrencies that can then be used within the game itself, or traded for cash. ""Every kid wants to make money playing games,"" says a 23-year-old trader in Malaysia who goes by the name of YellowPanther. ""That's the dream of my generation."" A month after he started trading NFTs last August, he decided to quit his job as a marketing executive to trade them full time. ""The day job took a long time - eight to nine hours a day - and the pay was quite low. I saw a big opportunity in the [NFT] space and I took the leap of faith,"" he says. YellowPanther now works with 29-year-old Resh Chandran, who offers training in conventional stocks, cryptocurrency and NFT trading in Singapore. Using Axie Infinity, one of the most popular ""play-to-earn games"", Mr Chandran introduces investors to mostly Filipino gamers who play on their behalf for a fee. But he warns the space is a ""wild wild west"".  The pandemic has only accelerated this growing trend of young people trading crypto and NFTs.  ""There was an extreme level of volatility in the marketplace so when you have volatility you also have opportunity in the market,"" says Lily Fang, a professor of finance at INSEAD business school. ""Young people were at home and it's almost a gamification of trading. All of these factors created a perfect condition for this to take off.""  For many young wannabe traders, advice is readily available on platforms such as YouTube, Twitter and Reddit. Brian Jung, 23, boasts one million YouTube followers but compared to other crypto influencers, he is known to talk more cautiously about the risks. ""I really have to make sure I'm careful about what I say to my audience because the last thing I want is for people to get hurt from these types of videos,"" he tells the BBC.  Brian's family emigrated from South Korea to the US and he believes his background affects how he invests and talks about money. ""Our family always struggled financially so I always have this frugal mindset,"" he says. ""My mum still works at the US Post Office and my dad works in a warehouse so I know one hour of their time is still equivalent to dollar value. I see what that is worth, regardless of how much income that I'm getting right now."" Gaining financial freedom is also what attracted 22-year-old Jowella Lim - a rare female trader - to the crypto world. But as well as the opportunities to make money, Jowella enjoys being at the forefront of this new technology.  As governments around the world look to regulate the industry, she believes they will help legitimise crypto and NFTs. ""Regulators have to eventually compromise and realise that this is a tech they cannot ignore, especially when it's constantly penetrating this society,"" she adds. Aside from financial losses, another big danger is addiction. ""The crypto market never sleeps so people really literally get sucked into it,"" says Mr Chandran.  Andy Leach, from addictions clinic Visions by Promises in Singapore, says he has seen a jump in young - particularly male - clients getting addicted to the thrill of trading crypto and NFTs.  ""You have the ability to watch Bitcoin going up and down and basically this process, this rollercoaster ride, the highs, the lows, it's available on your phone 24/7,"" he says. Despite losing money in the crypto market in the past, both Paxton and Kelvin are back trading after studying it more closely. I asked Kelvin if he thinks he may be addicted. ""You can put it that way,"" he smiles. ""But I would call it passion."""
Volatility,How the World Cup boosted 'Englishness',2024-09-25,2018-07-20,By Prof John Denham,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-44871563,"Could England's unexpected football success in the World Cup have had a small but significant impact on feelings of Englishness? Since England reached the semi-finals for the first time in 28 years under manager Gareth Southgate, there has been a noticeable increase in the number of people - especially young people - saying they are proud to be English. Across all age groups, backgrounds and different regions of England, the number identifying ""very strongly"" as English, rose from 54% to 58%. Among those aged 18-24, the increase was slightly more - rising from 46% to 51%.  More people were also keen to emphasise their English identity and to be proud of it.  These are the findings of a survey carried out for the Centre for English Identity and Politics at Winchester University, just after England lost their third-place play-off match against Belgium. It repeated questions put to 20,000 people in a BBC/YouGov survey in March 2018. To avoid prompting unconscious bias - and to allow comparison between the two surveys - identical questions were asked, which made no mention of football or the World Cup.  The original research found that fewer than six in 10 felt proud to be English.  Pride in identifying as English was weaker among the young (45%) and stronger among the old (72%).  Roughly one person in 10 surveyed in March said they would be embarrassed to describe themselves as English. This latest poll found an overall increase in those who said they were ""very proud"" to be English, from 36% to 40%.  The proportion who were either ""very"" or ""fairly"" proud rose from 57% to 61%.  Again, the survey found a greater increase among 18-24-year-olds - 27% were ""very proud"" to be English, up from 21% in March.  Those in this age group who were either ""very"" or ""fairly"" proud rose from 45% to 52%.  The proportion of middle-class respondents feeling ""very strongly"" English increased from 48% to 53%, slightly more than the change for working-class participants (62% to 65%). And, in one of the biggest changes, those living in London - shown by the earlier BBC poll to be the least ""English""-feeling part of England - saw an increase in those describing themselves as ""strongly English"" from 39% to 51%. Given the sample size and the volatility that is normal with identity surveys, we shouldn't place too much weight on individual increases.  The significance of the results lies more in the consistency with which association with English identity rose across different questions and different measures of Englishness. Of course, we cannot be certain that any of these changes are due to the England team's performance in the World Cup.  But more than 25 million people shared the collective experience of watching the semi-final against Croatia, an event focused on England rather than Britain.  And much of the media reported Southgate's remarks about the team representing a modern diverse English identity. So, it does seem more likely that football rather than, say, the sunny weather or parliamentary debates on Brexit, could have had this impact. Do England play better in white or red? Where are the UK's youngest and oldest city populations? The UK's rapidly changing mixed-race population Have adults ruined children's sport? Whether this will prove to be a temporary blip or something more long-lasting remains to be seen.  Sharpened English identity has been reported before, not least at the time of debates about Scottish devolution and independence.  Sport alone cannot carry all the burden of defining or sustaining national identity.  So, while success in the 2019 Fifa Women's World Cup or Euro 2020 might help, more important will be the extent to which this new-found confidence in an inclusive English identity is reflected more widely across society.  About this piece This analysis piece was commissioned by the BBC from an expert working for an outside organisation. Former Labour cabinet minister John Denham is professor of knowledge exchange and director of Winchester University's Centre for English Identity and Politics (CEIP).  The survey of 1,600 people was carried out for the Centre for English Identity and Politics at Winchester University and commissioned from polling organisation YouGov.

Volatility,US jobs shock as growth slows,2024-09-25,2019-03-08,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-47499326,"The US economy created the lowest number of jobs for a year-and-a-half in February, well below forecasts.  Just 20,000 new jobs were created last month against expectations of a 180,000 increase, official figures show. It is the lowest growth in non-farm payrolls since September 2017 when employment was affected by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. However, the small rise followed a sharp increase in new jobs in January, which was revised up to 311,000. Ian Shepherdson, chief economist Pantheon Macroeconomics, said that the expectation for 180,000 new positions in February was too high because the figures at the beginning of the year doubled-counted government workers who took second jobs during the US Government shutdown. He said that average new jobs growth over a three-month period was 186,000 which ""is entirely respectable"".  ""Indicators of labour demand have softened a bit but are nothing like weak enough to suggest that the February number is indicative of a new trend; we expect a return to the high 180,000 in March,"" he added.  Official data showed that the number of people ending part-time jobs or on temporary leave dropped by 225,000. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics said: ""This decline reflects, in part, the return of federal workers who were furloughed in January due to the partial government shutdown."" The figures also showed that growth in average earnings picked up to an annual rate of 3.4%, from 3.1% the month before, while the unemployment rate fell, dropping to 3.8% from 4% in January. President Donald Trump said rising wages were ""great for the American worker"", adding: ""I don't know if they expected to see it."" The construction sector saw the worst performance in February, with employment falling by 31,000 jobs compared with an increase of 53,000 in January.  Kully Samra, vice president at Charles Schwab, said that despite the weak job creation last month ""the outlook for the US economy remains strong relative to the rest of the world"".  ""The question is whether businesses are becoming more cautious because of weaker economic data and the return of volatility; or is the economy weakening a result of reduced business confidence?,"" he added.  However, Michael Pearce, senior US economist at Capital Economics, said: ""The sharp slowdown in payroll employment growth in February provides further evidence that economic growth has slowed in the first quarter. ""That adds weight to our view that the Fed will not be raising interest rates this year."" The Dow Jones Industrial Average opened down 212.81 points, or 0.8%, at 25,260.42. Investors were disappointed by the jobs data and a steep fall in Chinese exports amid a trade war with the US."
Volatility,Hard hat warning for Scottish construction,2024-09-25,2018-06-28,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-44639798,"The good news about Scotland's economic performance in the first three months of the year is that things are better, by the narrowest of margins, than in the UK as a whole.  The bad news is that things in the UK-as-a-whole are getting worse. Thus, the story of Scotland's economy continues to be one of comparison with its nearest neighbours, when there are bigger and tougher targets to be hit. There have been signs that Scotland's economy was beginning to pick up a bit, from a long, stale period. It now looks like the uptick is being pulled back by weakness in its biggest ""export"" market. Bad weather from January to March, and the chill winds of Brexit uncertainty, look to be the more likely culprits.  The weather changes. Brexit barely does.  The uncertainty surrounding it is becoming more of an acute problem, if business messaging is any guide. With better weather, construction workers can get back to work (though this week, they should be wearing sunscreen).  Despite representing less than 7% of the economy, their woes have been one of the main drivers of recent trends in output from the total economy. Construction output was down 3.5% between the first quarter of 2018 and the previous quarter, and down 9.2% on the start of last year. A year-on-year fall could be seen across the UK, but at -2.7%, it was far smaller.  As pointed out by John McLaren, the economist who runs the Scottish Trends website, the three-year comparison shows a 7.3% decline in Scotland and 7.5% growth across the UK.  The difference is nearly 15%. The latest figures represent nine consecutive quarters of decline for Scotland's construction sector. That's partly because the industry has been winding down big infrastructure projects - from the Queensferry Crossing to the big central Scotland motorway projects. It hasn't found sufficient replacements, either from the budget-constrained public sector or from private firms. John McLaren's analysis looks also at the figures from the Office for National Statistics - compiled in a different way, but giving some more detail of what may be going on in the construction sector. A drop of 11% (compared with -3% for the UK) takes output back to the place it was three years ago. ""This suggests there may be yet more to come in terms of falling Scottish construction output,"" says Scottish Trends. ""New infrastructure work has fallen to almost half the level of the peak seen in the second half of 2015. New public work is at its lowest level in almost four years, and new private commercial work has fallen to its lowest level in almost five years."" Another key measure highlighted is that Gross Domestic Product (total output) per head in Scotland has gone nowhere in the past three years, while there has been very modest growth of 1% in that measure across the UK. However, what McLaren also does is to devise his own measure of economic health, by stripping out the bits that cause the most volatility. That includes construction. The so-called ""active economy"" - manufacturing and non-financial private sector services - has seen growth of 2% between the start of 2017 and early 2018. The improvement in the fortunes of the offshore oil and gas industry can take some of the credit. Yet another measure that tells us something about the state of the economy is the relatively new measure, commissioned by the Scottish government, of consumer sentiment.  Comparing positive outlooks with negative, the balance has been to the gloomy downside in each quarter since the Brexit referendum. With households so downbeat, and with pay still barely growing, consumer demand is not strong. So what is being done about this? While the Downing Street cabinet seems to be debating whether the economic and business impact of Brexit is worth bothering about (Boris Johnson is reported to have put it a lot more bluntly), Scotland has a new economic secretary, and one with a lot more on his plate than Keith Brown. Derek Mackay has quite a fiefdom, across income tax powers to business rates reform, council tax and the economy brief. He may take some time to learn new parts of the brief. So it's probable that he signed off the same wording in response to the 0.2% first quarter growth that we might have heard from Keith Brown.   ""Scotland's economy is strong..."" it began.  No harm in talking it up, of course. But if the new cabinet secretary with responsibility for boosting growth can't grasp that the figures are actually weak, then this week's reshuffle and ""refresh"" won't have achieved much on the economic front."
Volatility,How the pandemic has changed the world economy,2024-09-25,2020-03-04,"By Lora Jones, Daniele Palumbo & David Brown ",https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51706225,"The coronavirus pandemic has reached almost every country in the world. Its spread has left national economies and businesses counting the costs, as governments struggle with new lockdown measures to tackle the spread of the virus.  Despite the development of new vaccines, many are still wondering what recovery could look like.  Here is a selection of charts and maps to help you understand the economic impact of the virus so far. Big shifts in stock markets, where shares in companies are bought and sold, can affect the value of pensions or individual savings accounts (Isas). The FTSE, Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nikkei all saw huge falls as the number of Covid-19 cases grew in the first months of the crisis. The major Asian and US stock markets have recovered following the announcement of the first vaccine in November, but the FTSE is still in negative territory. The FTSE dropped 14.3% in 2020, its worst performance since 2008. In response, central banks in many countries, including the UK, have slashed interest rates. That should, in theory, make borrowing cheaper and encourage spending to boost the economy. Some markets recovered ground in January this year, but this is a normal tendency known as the ""January effect"".  Analysts are worried that the possibility of further lockdowns and delays in vaccination programmes might trigger more market volatility this year. Many people have lost their jobs or seen their incomes cut. Unemployment rates have increased across major economies. In the United States, the proportion of people out of work hit a yearly total of 8.9%, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), signalling an end to a decade of jobs expansion. Millions of workers have also been put on government-supported job retention schemes as parts of the economy, such as tourism and hospitality, have come to a near standstill. The numbers of new job opportunities is still very low in many countries. Job vacancies in Australia have returned to the same level of 2019, but they are lagging in France, Spain, the UK and several other countries. Some experts have warned it could be years before levels of employment return to those seen before the pandemic. If the economy is growing, that generally means more wealth and more new jobs. It's measured by looking at the percentage change in gross domestic product, or the value of goods and services produced, typically over three months or a year. The IMF estimates that the global economy shrunk by 4.4% in 2020. The organisation described the decline as the worst since the Great Depression of the 1930s. The only major economy to grow in 2020 was China. It registered a growth of 2.3%. The IMF is, however, predicting global growth of 5.2% in 2021.  That will be driven primarily by countries such as India and China, forecast to grow by 8.8% and 8.2% respectively.  Recovery in big, services-reliant, economies that have been hit hard by the outbreak, such as the UK or Italy, is expected to be slow. The travel industry has been badly damaged, with airlines cutting flights and customers cancelling business trips and holidays. New variants of the virus - discovered only in recent months - have forced many countries to introduce tighter travel restrictions. Data from the flight tracking service Flight Radar 24 shows that the number of flights globally took a huge hit in 2020 and it is still a long way from recovery. The hospitality sector has been hit hard, with millions of jobs and many companies bankrupt. Data from Transparent - an industry-leading intelligence company that covers over 35 million hotel and rental listings worldwide - has registered a fall in reservations in all the top travel destinations. Billions of dollars have been lost in 2020 and although the forecast for 2021 is better, many analysts believe that international travel and tourism won't return to the normal pre-pandemic levels until around 2025. Retail footfall has seen unprecedented falls as shoppers stayed at home. New variants and surges in cases have made problems worse. Pedestrian numbers have fallen further from the first lockdown, according to research firm ShopperTrak,  Separate research suggests that consumers are still feeling anxious about their return to stores. Accountancy giant EY says 67% customers are now not willing to travel more than 5 kilometres for shopping.  This change in shopping behaviour has significantly boosted online retail, with a global revenue of $3.9 trillion in 2020. Governments around the world have pledged billions of dollars for a Covid-19 vaccine and treatment options. Shares in some pharmaceutical companies involved in vaccine development have shot up. Moderna, Novavax and AstraZeneca have seen significant rises. But Pfizer has seen its share price fall. The partnership with BioNTech, the high cost of production and management of the vaccine, and the growing number of same-size competitors have reduced the investors' trust in the company to have bigger revenue in 2021. A number of pharmaceutical firms have started already distributing doses and many countries have started their vaccination programmes. Many more - such as Johnson & Johnson and Sanofi/GSK - will join the vaccine distribution during 2021."
Volatility,Kwarteng: We stopped consumer spending collapse,2024-09-25,2022-09-29,By Tom Espiner & Daniel Thomas,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63079743,"Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng has said his mini-budget was needed to stop a collapse in consumer spending, despite it sparking days of market turmoil.  He told his party's MPs that cutting taxes and limiting energy bills had protected the economy.  The plans, announced last Friday, led to a slump in the pound and the Bank of England stepping in to prevent the collapse of some pension funds. Mr Kwarteng and Prime Minister Liz Truss defended their plans on Thursday. In a series of BBC interviews, Ms Truss insisted ""urgent action"" was needed to boost the UK economy, adding she was ""prepared to do what it takes to make that happen"" and that the tax cuts outlined last week were the right plan. This comes as a Yougov poll suggested Labour had opened up a massive 33-point lead over the Tories. Mr Kwarteng tried to bolster support among Tory MPs by sending them a message saying he was working at pace to show markets he had a ""clear plan"".  The chancellor said he understood their concern about the mini-budget, which promised £45bn of tax cuts funded by government borrowing. Fears this would be unaffordable and drive up interest rates had sent markets into a panic, with government borrowing costs surging, and the pound hitting a record low on Monday. The market turmoil was fuelled by the lack of an independent forecast on the impact of the plans, which had been offered by the Office for Budget Responsibility, but was declined by the government. Mr Kwarteng insisted the market volatility was ""global"" and being driven by the Ukraine war, Covid, and ""a super strong US dollar"".  He added that the government had needed to ""act quickly"". ""However I totally understand the need to be credible with markets,"" he told MPs. ""We will show markets our plan is sound, credible and will work to drive growth."" He said the government would announce reforms in ""childcare, business regulations, financial services, agriculture and more"" over the next six weeks. Ms Truss also argued market turmoil was being caused by global factors in a series of interviews with BBC local radio stations. She insisted that ""currencies are under pressure around the world"". Later, in BBC TV interviews, she said the UK was ""in a very serious situation"" but that was due to ""the aftermath of Covid and Putin's war in Ukraine"". The Treasury select committee, which is led by Conservative MP Mel Stride, an ally of former leadership contender Rishi Sunak, rejected the government explanation. In a letter to Mr Kwarteng on Thursday, Mr Stride said the government plans had ""resulted in various significant and concerning reactions in the markets"". He said a drop in the price of government bonds following the announcement of the plans was greater than ""any movement during the global financial crisis or the pandemic"". He said the financial impact of the mini-budget was larger than that of a typical Budget, but there had been no assessment by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) to go with it, despite the OBR saying it could produce one. ""It is hard to conclude other than that an absence of a forecast has in some part driven the lack of confidence in the markets,"" he said. ""Some may have formed the unfortunate impression that the government may be seeking to avoid scrutiny."" The OBR said on Thursday it had offered to provide a forecast for the mini-budget, but the chancellor had rejected that. BBC economics editor Faisal Islam said this absence of a forecast had made the market reaction to the plans worse. Mr Stride called on Mr Kwarteng to provide an OBR forecast ""earlier"" than 23 November, when the government is due to publish its medium term fiscal plan. The OBR said on Thursday it had been asked by Mr Kwarteng to produce a first draft of its next economic forecasts by 7 October. In an unusual move, Ms Truss will hold emergency talks with OBR head Richard Hughes on Friday, along with Mr Kwarteng. Analysis Zoe Conway, BBC News correspondent In this message, the chancellor is seeking to reassure MPs that he is working quickly to come up with a plan to calm the markets. In the face of mounting criticism from his backbenchers, he is also urging them to stay united. On 23 November, Mr Kwarteng is due to set out his medium term fiscal plan. He argues this will show how he intends to get debt falling but he has been coming under pressure from Conservative MPs to act more quickly. There is scepticism among MPs that the economic growth needed to pay for the announced tax cuts and the government's energy bills intervention can be generated quickly enough.  That's why, in this note to Conservative MPs, he says that there are lots of ''ambitious'' supply side reforms coming over the next six weeks. The chancellor might be conciliatory in tone, saying he always values colleagues and that he is ''always available for a meeting'', but there is no hint here that he is prepared to backtrack on any aspect of his economic plan. Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Mr Kwarteng rejected claims the government's plans had made people worse off by contributing to a spike in UK mortgage rates. It is the first time Mr Kwarteng has made a public comment on his mini-budget since Sunday, when he hinted there were more tax cuts to come.  Since then the plan has faced widespread criticism, with the International Monetary Fund and former Bank of England governor Mark Carney disparaging the plan.  On Wednesday, the Bank of England was forced to intervene, pledging to buy $65bn of government bonds in a bid to calm markets.  However, there are concerns the turmoil could continue and fears it might affect the housing market. A record number of mortgage products have been pulled since Friday, amid fears the Bank of England will have to raise interest rates much more sharply than previously expected. Mr Kwarteng said the government's plan to limit energy bills for households and businesses would save people ""thousands of pounds a year"". However, the chancellor said it was too early to say whether he would keep the previous government's promise to increase benefits next April in line with inflation.  He did, however, say the prime minister was committed to reinstating the triple lock on pensions, which means they increase by whichever is highest: inflation, the average wage rise, or 2.5%."
Volatility,Are cryptocurrencies a lifeline for Afghans?,2024-09-25,2022-03-16,By Anamaria Silic,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-60715707,"US sanctions, failing banks, and the drying up of foreign aid and cash transfers since the Taliban takeover have left Afghanistan's economy in tatters. Crypto is coming to the rescue. Following the Taliban takeover in August last year, 22-year-old Farhan Hotak from the province of Zabul in southern Afghanistan was left with no cash in hand.  Mr Hotak's sole source of income became a few hundred dollars of Bitcoin in a virtual wallet. After turning it into a traditional currency, Hotak managed to flee to Pakistan with his family of ten. ""After the Taliban takeover, crypto spread like wildfire over Afghanistan,"" he said. ""There is almost no other way to receive money"". Mr Hotak and his friends use Binance's P2P crypto exchange, which allows them to buy and sell their coins directly with other users on the platform. Finding temporary refuge in Pakistan, Mr Hotak is trading Bitcoin and Ethereum again and is now back traveling through Afghanistan, vlogging and teaching people about cryptocurrencies - digital money with no physical form that can have value. Fans of cryptocurrencies say they are the future of money and will stop people having to rely on banks. And in Afghanistan, it's banks that have stopped working, causing people to turn to cryptocurrency not just to trade, but to survive. Google trends data shows that web searches in Afghanistan for ""bitcoin"" and ""crypto"" increased in July just before the takeover in Kabul, while Afghans queued outside the banks in fruitless attempts to withdraw cash. After the Taliban takeover in August 2021, the use of crypto rose sharply. Last year, the data firm Chainalysis gave Afghanistan a rank of 20 out of the 154 countries it evaluated in terms of their crypto adoption.  Just one year before, in 2020, the company considered Afghanistan's crypto presence to be so minimal as to entirely exclude it from its ranking. According to Sanzar Kakar, an Afghan American who in 2019 created HesabPay, an app that helps Afghans transfer money using crypto, the country's ""crypto revolution"" is a result of the US sanctions against the Taliban and Haqqani group, who are now in power. The sanctions have meant that transactions with Afghan banks have all but stopped. The US has seized $7.1b (£5.4b) worth of assets from the Afghan central bank and ended transfers of US currency. Companies in Poland and France contracted to print the Afghan currency ended shipments.  The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, known as the Swift system, which underpins international financial transactions, suspended all services in Afghanistan.  The liquidity crisis that followed meant that commercial banks couldn't lend money, and retail customers couldn't take their own money out of banks. An already war-devastated economy with 80% of its GDP coming from foreign aid and donors, Afghanistan was left on the verge of collapse.  ""We're using crypto to try to solve this problem, that 22.8 million Afghans are marching toward starvation, including one million children that might starve to death this winter,"" said Mr Kakar.  An app like Mr Kakar's HesabPay allows instant transfers of funds from one phone to another without touching banks, the Afghan government, or Taliban. In the three months since its launch, the app had over 2.1 million transactions and 380,000 active users. Aid organisations have also caught on to crypto's potential in Afghanistan. In 2013, Roya Mahboob founded Digital Citizen Fund, an NGO to teach computer programming and financial literacy to young Afghan women. The organisation had 11 women-only IT centres in Herat and another two in Kabul, where 16,000 women were taught everything from Windows software to robotics. After the Taliban takeover, the group refocused its efforts to provide young women cryptocurrency training via Zoom video calls.  Digital Citizen Fund also started sending money to Afghan families via crypto, to help them provide food and housing, and in some cases, to help people get out of the country. ""Crypto has been critical for Afghanistan in the last six months. Everybody's talking about trading. It got to a point where I got on a plane to Kabul and people were talking about Dogecoin and Bitcoin,"" Ms Mahboob told the BBC. Gaining ground in Afghanistan are the so-called ""stablecoins,"" virtual coins pegged to the US dollar, eliminating the volatility usually associated with crypto. The recipients then convert the stablecoins to the local currency at money exchanges. They can also be sent directly to recipients, without the need for a bank account.  But there are barriers that make access to cryptocurrency more difficult for an average Afghan. Access to the internet, while growing, remains low. There were 8.64 million internet users in Afghanistan in January 2021, according to DataReportal.com.  Unreliable electricity poses another major issue, as power outages are common. The country's new Taliban rulers have been accused of not paying Central Asian electricity suppliers. And with the banking system paralyzed, many Afghans don't have the means to pay their power bills. Education is also key when it comes to crypto. Mr Hotak said he found reliable online communities on Telegram, WhatsApp and Facebook that give him trading tips and offer him sound trading advice. But there is also plenty of misinformation about crypto easily found online.  Despite the steep learning curve and several barriers to entry, within Afghanistan using crypto is seen as an improvement on the status quo.  But cryptocurrencies are not a silver bullet, said. Nigel Pont, a senior advisor at HesabPay. Unlocking the restraints imposed on Afghanistan's financial situation is crucial to alleviating the growing poverty, he said.  ""It's the failures of the traditional centralised fiat system that are starving Afghanistan."" In February, US President Joe Biden signed an executive order splitting $7 billion in frozen Afghan funds between aid for Afghanistan and US victims of 9/11, who in 2010 sued the Taliban and al-Qaeda for their role in the attack.  Though reports have said the administration would direct the other half of frozen Afghan foreign reserves to humanitarian groups, the executive order does not specify how the money will be released, and it remains unclear.  Most people in Afghanistan are still waiting for liquidity and unemployment relief, and the United Nations warned the country could approach a ""near-universal"" poverty rate of 97% by the middle of 2022. Millions remain on the brink of famine in the country. ""We want the US sanctions to be lifted so we can trade, so we can see our families from abroad. We want the frozen funds to be given to the families in Afghanistan,"" Mr Hotak said."
Volatility,The YouTubers Indians turn to for financial advice,2024-09-25,2022-06-21,By Nikhil Inamdar and  Ayushi Shah,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-61877422,"When the pandemic hit two years ago and movie studios in Mumbai downed their shutters indefinitely, 23-year-old filmmaker Shivam Khatri decided to teach himself a skill he'd not learnt at school or college - managing money. He rummaged through books and tutorials, but quickly learnt that it was the young financial content creators on YouTube that spoke his language. ""Their videos are simple and easy to understand. And they cover a variety of topics,"" Mr Khatri says.  One of the creators he followed avidly was Rachana Ranade, whose impish, breezy manner of breaking down complex financial jargon into easily digestible content has earned her 3.5 million subscribers on YouTube - proof of a growing appetite for easy-to-understand financial content among India's young, tech-savvy investors.  In her swanky new office in the western city of Pune, Ms Ranade showed us a wall-to-wall graphic that mapped her rise as a YouTuber. She uploaded her first video in February 2019 and in barely five months she'd reached 100,000 subscribers. Her growth since then has been nothing short of meteoric. Ms Ranade often gets mobbed for autographs and selfies - the kind of adulation normally reserved for Bollywood celebrities or cricketing icons.  An unabashed movie buff, one wall of her office features quotes from Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan's movies. She uses these quotes to explain financial concepts that are hard to grasp. There's one from the hit film Kal Ho Na Ho - which translates to ""whether there is a tomorrow or not"" - to emphasise the need to buy life insurance. It all boils down to one mantra - ""finance that's simplified"", Ms Ranade says.  It's exactly what India's young investors are after. Millions of them opened trading accounts during the pandemic to participate in the market bull run, aided by investing services online.  But only three out of 10 Indians are financially literate, official surveys point out. And they are hungry to learn how to make an easy buck in the stock market, or the ropes of entrepreneurship amid a unicorn boom that's made overnight billionaires. It's this sweet spot that's turned financial content into one of the fastest growing genres online. ""For Gen-Z and millennials, YouTube is a university now in India,"" says Ankur Warikoo, an entrepreneur-turned-""fin-fluencer"" - or financial influencer - whose videos focus on personal finance, entrepreneurship and productivity hacks.  His massive popularity even got him a publishing contract last year, with his first book, Do Epic Shit, quickly becoming a bestseller. While the perception is that he became a sensation overnight, Mr Warikoo says his journey as a content creator started nearly a decade ago. But the pandemic proved to be an inflection point. ""Suddenly, there was a rise in high-quality content being offered by a lot of creators. There was an audience with time and money at hand, and a market that was extremely supportive,"" Mr Warikoo says. ""If this was a bear run, you would struggle to put your point across."" It was ""a potent mix"" of enabling factors - cheap data, growing internet penetration and the shift among India's Gen-Z and millennial population from TV and print to digital video - that led to this success, Mr Warikoo explains. He adds that the topic - money - especially resonated with young Indians: ""It's something that we all wish to understand but have very rarely been given an opportunity to [understand]."" For years, India has had several business channels broadcasting real-time financial market news. But they largely cater to traders and institutional investors, rather than first-time investors. That's a gap in the market that many of the YouTubers have successfully been able to fill.  And because of their success, they are now being wooed with big money from advertisers and brand managers. According to Forbes magazine, top influencers can earn as much as $20,000 for a single branded video. Experts laud the fact that financial education is now more accessible, but they also advise caution. While business news channels are strictly regulated, most digital content creators operate in a grey zone. Ms Ranade and Mr Warikoo do not recommend individual stocks, but many others do, often without the necessary expertise or qualifications. ""When it comes to slightly finer issues of long-term investing, I would trust people who have been through a few market cycles. Right now while this digital phenomenon has overtaken us, everything has only gone up,"" says Govindraj Ethiraj, a former editor at a business channel, who now runs a fact-checking website. After a two-year bull run, Indian equity markets are experiencing a lot of volatility with billions of dollars of foreign money being pulled out of the country.  So the next few years, Mr Ethiraj says, will be the first test of whether the success of India's new money influencers is enduring or merely ephemeral. "
Volatility,"No new oil and gas fields, say Scottish ministers",2024-09-25,2023-01-10,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-64209676,"The Scottish government has announced a presumption against new oil and gas exploration as part of its new energy strategy.   Scottish ministers say they can no longer support the previous position of ""maximising economic recovery"" of fossil fuel reserves. Licensing new developments in the sector is reserved to Westminster. The Scottish government's plan for the energy sector over the next 20 years is focused on boosting renewables.  The draft energy strategy supports ""the fastest possible just transition"" away from oil and gas. It restates the long-standing opposition to new nuclear projects and calls on the UK government to reform the energy market. The Scottish Conservatives say oil and gas workers in north-east Scotland are being regarded as an ""afterthought"". Michel Matheson, net zero and energy secretary, said: ""At a time of unprecedented uncertainty in our energy sector, accelerating the transition towards becoming a renewables powerhouse makes sense for a number of reasons – particularly to helping to mitigate against future global market volatility and the high energy prices which are making life so difficult for so many people across Scotland.  ""While we do not hold all the powers to address these issues at source, this strategy sets out how we can achieve an energy transition that ensures we have sufficient, secure and affordable energy to meet our needs, support Scotland's economic growth and capitalise on future sustainable export opportunities."" The energy strategy suggests increasing the current level of renewable electricity generation capacity and speeding up the decarbonisation of domestic industry, transport and heat in buildings. Liam Kerr, Scottish Conservative energy spokesman, said: ""The cabinet secretary's much delayed energy strategy will represent a far from happy new year for the tens of thousands of workers engaged in oil and gas. These workers often feel like an afterthought for this government and that impression won't improve after today."" Mr Kerr said the Scottish government ""could provide no evidence"" of how it would hit a target of 77,000 low-carbon jobs by 2050.  The energy strategy was published alongside a ""just transition"" plan, which sets out how the shift away from fossil fuels can be done fairly. The UK government published a similar strategy last year which paved the way for a fresh round of oil and gas licensing. More than 100 new licences are expected to be granted by regulators this year. But Westminster's Environmental Audit Committee has criticised the plan for having ""significant gaps"" and not enough focus on energy saving. The committee called on the UK government to set a date for the end of oil and gas licensing. Offshore Energies UK (OEUK), which represents more than 400 energy firms, welcomed proposals to create a ""hydrogen economy"" in Scotland. The organisation said it ""strongly"" supports plans to develop the Acorn Project, a carbon capture storage and production facility at St Fergus in Aberdeenshire. However, the organisation expressed concerns about plans to wind down oil and gas production. Jenny Stanning, OEUK's external relations director, said: ""Scotland gets 79% of its total energy from oil and gas according to its latest official figures. Across the UK about 24 million homes (85% of the total) rely on gas boilers for heat and we get 42% of our electricity from gas. We also have 32m vehicles running on petrol and diesel.  ""These plain facts means we will need gas and oil for decades to come. Additionally, in Scotland alone, the offshore industry supports 90,000 jobs. Across the UK it's around 200,000. ""So we need to ensure that the final strategy acknowledges the continuing role of oil and gas in Scotland's energy security and economy - as well as our sector's role in a rapid transition to a low-carbon future."" SSE chief executive Alistair Phillips-Davies welcomed the Scottish government's draft report. He said: ""The draft strategy supports ambitious plans for developing onshore and offshore wind, pumped hydro storage, carbon capture and hydrogen.   ""But to get there requires increased pace and we look forward to working with the Scottish government and its agencies to turn the ambitions contained within the strategy and plan into tangible actions that support the clean energy transition, build local supply chains, create good green jobs and work in partnership with communities."" When the last strategy was published in 2017, a target was set for half of Scotland's energy to come from renewables by 2030.   In the last quarter of 2022, 26.7% of Scottish energy consumption came from renewables. Ahead of the publication of the latest strategy, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: ""The imperative is clear. In this decade we must set Scotland on the path to an energy system that meets the challenge of becoming a net zero nation by 2045, that supplies safe, secure and affordable energy for all and that generates economic opportunity through a just transition. ""The current energy crisis has demonstrated how vulnerable our energy system is to international price shocks, while laying bare the need for structural reform to ensure affordability for consumers."" There are many similarities between the draft energy strategies from January 2017 and 2023. More wind, onshore and offshore and continued investment in developing niche marine technologies like wave and tidal. There's still opposition to new nuclear power, although this time we've only one such generating site at Torness. But the big difference is in support for oil and gas exploration and development with ministers then keen to avoid the ""premature cessation"" of production. Now they want to accelerate the shift away from fossil fuels. But Holyrood has limited powers over oil and gas and it's difficult to see what practical steps it can take to bring this about.  Although that was true for fracking and they managed to stop that. These are two different responses to an energy crisis from two different governments, with one leaning into oil and gas and the other firmly leaning away."
Volatility,Deal reached to give Manx Gas customers rebate,2024-09-25,2021-12-21,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-isle-of-man-59745576,"Manx Gas customers are set to receive a rebate on bills next year after the government reached a deal with the monopoly provider. Domestic and commercial users are set to be repaid at least £58 in February. It come after the government opted to reduce the firm's infrastructure payments by £1.4m, on the condition the savings are passed on to customers.     Cabinet Office Minister Kate Lord-Brennan said it was welcome news given bills were due to rise 27.5%. Manx Gas CEO Jo Cox said it was important the funds went ""directly"" to those impacted at a time of ""unprecedented and ongoing volatility"" in global markets. In October, Tynwald members agreed to allow for the a gas tariff increase so the company could meet the rising cost of wholesale gas. The company has since requested another review of its charges as its profits continue to fall. Repayments to gas customers were first raised during discussions over a new voluntary regulatory deal with Manx Gas, but talks collapsed earlier this year when politicians voted in favour of the creation of a statutory regulator. The rebate has now been made possible after the government agreed to adjust loans the gas provider holds with state-owned electricity and water authority Manx Utilities. Accounts held by the Isle of Man government will not receive the rebate. The announcement follows a separate pledge by Treasury to pay an additional £0.5m in winter fuel payments to support those affected by the increased gas tariffs.

Volatility,Why brands are leaving social media,2024-09-25,2023-07-12,Chris Stokel-Walker,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20230712-consumer-brands-leave-social-media-meta-threads,"As new social media apps including Threads pop up, some companies are choosing to eschew the platforms. What’s going on? Another day, another social media platform to post on. The launch of Threads on 6 July marked the latest major short-form text platform available to social media users, following Twitter, Mastodon and Bluesky – plus a raft of other, smaller competitors. Like many of us, big companies are struggling to keep up with the number of social media platforms vying for their time and attention. They’re faced with the important choice of which apps to choose, in a market where social media can be an important brand-building tool and enable them to target consumers where they are most active. For the past decade, It’s been all but required for serious brands to maintain a social media presence, says Nathan Allebach, creative director at Allebach Communications, which has partnered with brands including Utz Snacks and Steak-umm to build out their social media presences. Not only is it a major avenue to meet consumers, but social media is also a key contributor for brand discovery – which companies hope will translate into sales across generations of shoppers. Yet instead of scrambling to claim digital real estate across all these newly emerging platforms, some companies are choosing to be more judicious about which platforms they choose to join. In some cases, they’re learning from brands who jumped the social media ship years ago. Bullying and polarisation One of the first large brands to make the move was Lush Cosmetics, which in November 2021 decided to stop posting on social media platforms controlled by Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. The beauty company initially dropped off the platforms in 2019, due to concerns about fighting with ever-changing social media algorithms as well as the company’s worry about the potentially negative impact of social media on young people. “We are a social brand, and community has been key for us,” says Annabelle Baker, Lush’s global brand director. “When we joined social media, Facebook and those platforms were everything we were looking for initially: they were direct links to the communities.” But Baker says they withdrew when social media changed to being inherently less social and user-centric, mediated instead by algorithms controlled by companies. Although Lush re-emerged on the platforms during Covid-19 in order to reach customers during lockdowns, the beauty brand has now gone dark again. They’ve been off social media for almost two years – and don’t have current plans to come back. Time, say social media experts, is a driver pushing away brands: it can be a tall task to ask often junior employees to keep tabs on so many platforms. It’s a situation that has become more pressing with the new boom in Twitter alternatives, where a clear winner hasn’t yet emerged. But some brands have also been feeling a distinct sense of unease about social media in general. First, like Lush, some companies are unhappy about the way the platforms operate and their management. But perhaps more pressing is the risk of followers turning on brands amid the volatility and toxicity of some social media user bases. As social media has polarised society in unexpected ways, brands have found many users quick to criticise an account they believe has mis-stepped. When luxury fashion brand Bottega Veneta left much of social media in 2021, its creative director Daniel Lee cited  “a mood of playground bullying on social media”. He told The Guardian: “I don’t want to collude in an atmosphere that feels negative. ” “The main utility of an organic social media presence for most brands is activating the 1% of their super fans and haters. Ultimately, every team has to assess the risk-reward ratio of how much to invest … the investment isn’t worth it to every brand, especially with how many platforms there are to consider and how precarious they can be,” says Allebach. To join or not to join? The launch of Threads has brought the stay-or-go conversation back to the forefront. Along with audiences already on other emerging platforms, Meta’s purported Twitter killer already has more than 100 million users, less than a week after it began – in other words, a growing group of potential customers for brands. Yet deciding whether to embrace the new apps is tricky. For one, brands are still struggling with the issues of reputation and user abuse. And some brands may also have concerns with Threads specifically, as Meta has prior precedent of launching apps designed to compete with and supplant existing incumbents (Instagram Reels, for instance, was designed to tackle TikTok), which don’t always succeed. Companies could end up devoting significant resources to building a presence on a platform that disappears in a few months’ time. Brands will make their social media decisions individually – but Allebach says many still ultimately feel pressure to hang a shingle on these new platforms. “At this point, it’s hard to imagine a future where brands start pulling out of social media platforms en masse,” he says. Yet he adds it’s possible we’ll see more brands pulling back, especially if ""they can’t quantify the value or start believing the risks outweigh the rewards”. Lush’s Baker says that her company isn’t eager to leap back into social media with Threads – even with the large audience. “It’ll be a test of time to see whether people stay there and actively use it,” she says. “But I’m not tempted to jump on Threads for the time being.”"
Volatility,The rise of 'finfluencers',2024-09-25,2023-09-18,Katie Bishop,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20230915-should-you-trust-personal-finance-advice-from-a-finfluencer,"A growing number of creators are doling out tips online for how to spend, save and invest. Is it a modern approach to financial literacy – or a big red flag? When Yasmin Purnell started blogging in 2017, she planned to share her experiences of becoming a digital nomad. However, the creative-writing graduate and copywriter soon found visitors to her site were more interested in how she afforded her freelance lifestyle. Noticing the hunger for personal finance advice, UK-based Purnell, now 31, rebranded her website. The Wallet Moth – a blog offering finance and frugal-living advice – was born. ""I shifted into personal finance articles, as my small-but-growing audience expressed more interest in how I had avoided debt in my 20s, how I'd budgeted to have a financial safety net for freelancing and what side-hustles I worked to support being location independent,"" she says. It's the human aspect – sharing personal stories and putting a face to the advice – that makes all the difference, she believes. ""My content doesn't necessarily offer something that is better than traditional financial advice, but people more and more want to connect with someone they can think of as an online friend, versus a faceless company."" Purnell is among the swelling tide of financial influencers: creators feeding a seemingly insatiable desire for content on spending, saving and investing. Throughout the past few years, the popularity of these 'finfulencers' has exploded, with many amassing followings into the millions. A growing part of the global influencer industry, with an estimated market size of a whopping $104bn (£83bn) as of 2022, some of these finfluencers report earning upwards of six-figures as social media presences. Their posts can provide welcome insight into the often-opaque world of personal finance – a world young people specifically are finding harder and harder to see into. Yet if trusting money advice from strangers with murky qualifications gives you pause, there's a reason. A young audience Millions of people log on every day to consume advice from financial influencers. Humphrey Yang, a former financial adviser in his 30s, leads the finfluencer pack with more than 50m likes and 3m followers on TikTok, as of this writing. US-based Yang focuses on personal finance advice, with his most popular videos explaining concepts such as retirement accounts and stock prices. In his most-watched video – more than 14 million views – Yang acts out borrowing an iPhone, selling it and then buying the same model for less a year later in order to explain the concept of short selling. Easily digestible content like Yang's appeals primarily to a young audience, says Radhika Duggal, an adjunct business professor at New York University and the chief marketing officer at fintech company Super. ""With the lack of financial education in schools, Gen Zers are being forced to learn about money on their own,"" she says. ""This is the first economic crisis that younger generations are experiencing, and it's no surprise that they're turning to influencers to ensure that they can make good decisions and weather the current climate."" Connor Campbell, a business finance expert at financial comparison site NerdWallet UK, says successful finfluencers purposely provide an easy entry point into money-related topics. ""Financial influencers tend to create content that is appealing to younger generations, specifically using terminology and examples that relate to pop-culture and simplifying financial terms,"" he says. One example of a simplified financial concept is ""cash-stuffing"", a budgeting method that went viral on TikTok in 2022. The cash-stuffing system advocates for dividing physical cash into folders or envelopes for allotted expenses, such as groceries or hobbies, meaning followers are less likely to overspend. It's not a novel concept, but it is new to many young social media users, especially those with limited personal finance exposure. Content like this is helpful to promote better financial habits among young people, believes Campbell. ""By presenting financial tips in an accessible way, they've improved financial literacy, and invoked a newfound interest in being proactive about where people are putting their money, and ways that they can bump their savings."" Purnell agrees, saying that responses from her readers has been ""overwhelmingly positive"", and that people appreciate her advice on living more frugally. She believes that the relatability of her content, combined with the simplicity of her advice, is a winning formula for young viewers. ""I'm just another person looking to save money and perhaps try out a side-hustle or two,"" she says. Experts or regular people? Yet although creators say audiences have been highly receptive to their tips, experts caution some finfluencers may also be leading followers astray – and even, in some cases, taking advantage of them. ""Some of these influencers are just regular people with no background in finance,"" says Campbell. ""Social media can cause people to rush into making uninformed decisions due to a fear of missing out on something that a lot of other people are participating in – and when these trends involve real money, this can sometimes become an issue."" Experts have recently warned of surges in self-directed investing based on questionable guidance from financial influencers, arguing some of these social media stars are offering poor advice, either because of their own lack of financial knowledge, or because it is in their interest to post increasingly outlandish content in the interest of gaining followers. In some cases, organisations have accused personal finance content creators of leveraging the vulnerabilities of a debt-ridden generation to boost their own follower counts. Last year, the UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) warned against online promotions focused on paying off debt, saying that influencers involved in these posts were attracting ""vulnerable or indebted customers"" to follow ""misleading"" financial advice. Offering questionable personal finance advice to capture a large audience has been an issue for decades. Finance mega-stars, many of whom have built profitable careers with their money-management tips, have found themselves in hot water in the past. For instance, Suze Orman, a high-profile TV personality, has come under fire for endorsing questionable financial products, and was even accused of fraud in 2009. Now, however, social media is exposing a larger, younger and often less-educated audience to often unvetted personal finance advice. There's also the added complication of how influencers make their money – social media stars often endorse products for payment, meaning their advice may not be objective. In particular, the rise in cryptocurrency adverts have raised flags, after high-profile cases of influencers endorsing new crypto products. The volatility of cryptocurrency means that it can be difficult to predict the market – and yet many social media users have been led to believe that digital currencies are a good investment. Last year, Kim Kardashian found herself under the microscope when she posted about cryptocurrency Ethereum Max. Although Ethereum saw a rapid rise in 2021, it quickly crashed, losing 97% of its value by January 2022. Investors who had suffered huge losses brought a lawsuit against Kardashian (who currently has more than 364m Instagram followers) and other celebrities who promoted the product, claiming that they had conspired to inflate the value of the tokens. The case was eventually thrown out, but the judge warned of ""celebrities' ability to readily persuade millions of undiscerning followers to buy snake oil with unprecedented ease and reach"". 'Boring but highly effective' James Beckett, 33, launched a content side-hustle after noticing how much bad investment advice was circulating online. The former social media marketer, whose YouTube channel has a small but growing following of several thousand subscribers, says many financial influencers know that engagement comes from get-rich-quick schemes and flaunting their supposed wealth. ""TikTok has reduced our attention spans to fractions of a second, and you need flashy investing content to capture an audience,"" says Beckett, based in Hertfordshire, UK. Beckett isn't the only one worried about too-good-to-be-true schemes and investment scams. Finance industry professionals and organisations have also started to speak out about these issues, and the FCA recently proposed a crackdown on finfluencers, arguing their advice can be misleading, and that they often ""have little knowledge of what they're promoting"". However, Beckett believes he and many finfluencers like him also provide what he describes as ""boring but highly effective"" financial advice. He says these tips are not only lower risk but also more reliable – he discusses the ins and out of concepts including passive investing and index funds – especially for young people without a strong financial-education background or lots of money to burn. Beckett argues social media finance content can offer an accessible way into managing money, without having to pay the high fees many financial advisors or organisations demand. ""Financial influencers can be problematic, because some of them prey on people's naivety,"" he says. ""But on the flip side, there are a lot of people doing good out there, and they are filling a huge gap left by our education system."" Proceeding with caution Without a regulatory body, the world of finfluencing remains somewhat murky. For many, finfluencers have led to accessible financial guidance, filling a gap in financial literacy among young people. And even amid questionable advice or worrying tactics, Campbell argues that, if paired with a discerning attitude and a little bit of scepticism, finfluencers can help put people on the path to responsible money management. ""Personal finances are – as the name suggests – personal to the individual, and everyone's circumstances are different,"" he says. ""It's important to assess whether an influencer's suggestions are relevant to your financial situation."" Beckett adds that although finfluencers might have a bad reputation, they can also offer a route into the confusing, and sometimes intentionally opaque, world of finance and investing. Objective influencers, who don't cash in on partnerships or present their advice as bulletproof, can be a force for good, especially for followers who've never thought about savings or growing wealth. ""Like everything in the world, there are good finfluencers and bad ones,"" he says. ""While the most obnoxious, audacious creators have a larger tendency to go viral, you can still find fantastic personal finance content on social media platforms from people who genuinely want to help. Finfluencers aren't worth shunning entirely."""

The focus of spending is on building a China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) - a network of roads, railway and pipelines between the long-time allies. They will run some 3,000km (1,800 miles) from Gwadar in Pakistan to China's western Xinjiang region. The projects will give China direct access to the Indian Ocean and beyond. This marks a major advance in China's plans to boost its influence in Central and South Asia, correspondents say, and far exceeds US spending in Pakistan. PTV broadcast the historic signing and exchanging of agreements between the two countries ""Pakistan, for China, is now of pivotal importance. This has to succeed and be seen to succeed,"" Reuters quoted Mushahid Hussain Sayed, chairman of the Pakistani parliament's defence committee, as saying. Pakistan, for its part, hopes the investment will strengthen its struggling economy and help end chronic power shortages.  Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said ties with China had ""remained robust"" despite political changes and ""major regional developments"" over four generations.  ""Our relations are based on the shared ideals and principles of mutual trust, mutual benefit and mutual respect,"" he said. Is Pakistan on the verge of becoming the Asian Tiger Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said it would become when he was last in power in 1997? China plans to inject some $46bn - almost three times the entire foreign direct investment Pakistan has received since 2008. Many say Mr Sharif's penchant for ""thinking big"" and China's increasing need to control maritime trade routes may well combine to pull off an economic miracle in Pakistan. But there are questions over Pakistan's ability to absorb this investment given its chronic problems with militancy, separatism, political volatility and official corruption.  China is worried about violence from ethnic Uighurs in its mostly Muslim north-western Xinjiang region and fears hard-line separatists could team up with Uighur militants fighting alongside members of Pakistan's Taliban. In Pakistan, a decade-old separatist insurgency in Balochistan province, where the economic corridor starts, makes that area extremely volatile. Many observers believe however that the incentive of an economic miracle may make Islamabad work harder to stabilise the situation.  China prestige projects around the world Mr Xi will spend two days holding talks with his counterpart Mamnoon Hussain, Mr Sharif and other ministers. He was expected to discuss security issues with Mr Sharif, including China's concerns that Muslim separatists from Xinjiang are linking up with Pakistani militants.

Under the CPEC plan, China's government and banks will lend to Chinese companies, so they can invest in projects as commercial ventures.

Volatility,The NI homes trialling 'green' heating technology,2024-09-25,2021-11-01,By Louise Cullen,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-59088957,"Fifty years after the last coal mine closed in Northern Ireland, fossil fuel is still powering most of our homes.    But a pilot scheme in County Fermanagh is trying out new, environmentally-friendly technology.    The initiative involves six Housing Executive homes in Lisnaskea.  Some have been fitted with solar panels, while others are using a heat pump, with an oil-fired boiler as a back-up.    Heat pumps extract warmth from the air, the ground or water - a bit like a fridge operating in reverse. They are powered by electricity, so if you have a low-carbon source of electricity, they provide greener heating. Irene McKiernan lives in one of the houses that is now on a hybrid heat pump.    ""I was a bit nervous, because it was a big, big job,"" she said.    ""There was a lot of upheaval.  New windows, every radiator had to be replaced, all the floorboards upstairs lifted to replace the pipes and the new hot tank, then the heating system itself out the back.  So it's all different, and a new oil tank and everything was just upside down for a bit.  ""But it was brilliant. I wanted to be part of something that was greener and more efficient.""  That ""upheaval"" was to bring the house up to an insulation standard that allows a heat pump to be at its most effective.    And now, in her back garden, there is still a small oil tank and an oil boiler which will kick in when the weather gets extremely cold - below freezing, for example.    But alongside it is the heat pump and, on the back wall, a box houses the electronic 'brain' that controls the whole system.    ""This system is reducing the carbon emissions between 40 to 55%,"" said Robert Clements, a sustainable development manager with the Housing Executive.    ""It's also improving thermal comfort, and we're trying to keep the bills down for the householder.""    Recent volatility in the international oil market has hit households in Northern Ireland hard, because it is so heavily dependent on fossil fuels.   Around two thirds of homes here are being heated by oil.    Less than a fifth of homes are on the gas network, which is currently being expanded in the south west.   Gas is seen as a transitional fuel from oil, on the way towards greener home heating.    The UK government has announced that fossil fuel heating systems will no longer be included in new-build homes from 2025.   In England and Wales, where gas is the predominant fuel, the government has also announced a £5,000 grant to help householders move to renewable energy in their homes.  But there is no such scheme here - yet.    ""We're waiting on the Energy Strategy,"" said Pat Austin, from the National Energy Association.    ""We need information, advice, and we will need grants.    ""People simply don't have that sort of resource to make the upfront move to decarbonisation.    ""To move from oil to heat pump and have the requisite cavity wall insulation, you're looking at the region of £12,000. People simply don't have that.    ""How we get that money will be for government, whether it will be through grants, whether it will be through levies on bills, but there needs to be a plan for Northern Ireland.""  The Energy Strategy is due to be published shortly.    Back in County Fermanagh, Irene can feel the difference in her home.    ""It's a lot warmer, you know,"" she said.    ""Especially with a baby, I need to have a warm home, and it's just more efficient, all-round heat.    ""I have three kids, and I want them to follow - we need to sort of lead, and the kids need to see us doing something. ""If we all play our part, the next generation will do the same, and the next generation will do the same. So it just carries on."" "
Volatility,China property firm Country Garden suspends shares,2024-09-25,2024-04-02,By Mariko Oi,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68710728,"Crisis-hit Chinese property developer Country Garden has suspended trade in its shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange after delaying the publication of its annual financial results. The firm said last week that it needed more time to collect information as it restructures its debts. It defaulted on its overseas debt last year and faces a winding-up petition. In January, rival real estate giant China Evergrande was ordered to liquidate by a Hong Kong court. Country Garden said ""due to the continuous volatility of the industry, the operating environment the Group confronting is becoming increasingly complex"", when it announced its earnings report would be delayed. The first hearing for Country Garden's winding-up petition, which was filed by Ever Credit Ltd, is scheduled for 17 May. Ever Credit is a unit of Kingboard Holdings, a laminates maker and property investor. The suspension of Country Garden's shares came as the Hong Kong stock market reopened after the Easter weekend. Also on Tuesday, shares in Chinese state-backed property developer China Vanke fell to a record low. On Friday, the firm reported a fall of more than 50% in its annual profit and told investors that it aimed to boost its cash flow by slashing debt over the next two years. China's real estate industry has been facing a major financial squeeze since 2021 when the government introduced measures to curb the amount big developers could borrow. Several large Chinese property developers, including Evergrande and Country Garden, have defaulted on their debts in the last few years. Problems in the country's property market are having a major impact as the sector accounts for around a third of the economy. Beijing has announced various measures in a bid to boost housing demand. Last month, the country's financial markets regulator accused Evergrande and its founder, Hui Ka Yan, of inflating revenues by $78bn (£62.2bn) in the two years before the firm defaulted on its debt. The company's mainland business Hengda Real Estate was fined $583.5m while Mr Hui faces being banned for life from China's financial markets."

Volatility,Crypto regulation may drive growth in poorer areas,2024-09-25,2022-05-01,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-bristol-61156439,"The south west is ""perfectly positioned"" to benefit from plans to regulate cryptocurrency, an expert has claimed. Chancellor Rishi Sunak recently announced his intention to make the UK a ""global hub"" for crypto. The move could spread wealth to areas - like parts of the south west - that have lacked investment, crypto entrepreneur Herbert Sim has said. Academic Chris Carr said he was ""doubtful"" this would happen. He explained that while ""some people have managed to get wealthy, there is still a concern that this will benefit the rich, who can afford to take risks and invest early"". Despite this, he said the emerging industry - which has been likened to a virtual form of cash - could create platforms ""that aim to distribute wealth more evenly"".  ""There are certainly people out there who have this aim in mind."" Crypto expert Mr Sim - who has even trademarked the name ""Bitcoin Man"" - is more optimistic and believes Mr Sunak's plans could ""reverse these fortunes"" in areas which have historically lacked investment. Attracting more of the £1.64 trillion global industry to areas like Swindon, Cheltenham and Gloucester would provide a welcome boost by creating highly-skilled and paid jobs like blockchain engineers and cryptocurrency developers, he said. He added: ""The UK and the south west is perfectly positioned to capitalise on the growth of crypto. ""Crypto is only going one direction - and that is firmly towards growth. There is no shortage of demand so the only question that matters is where it is going to set up base. ""With China's crackdown on Bitcoin and the crypto mines (which use vast quantities of power to create new blockchain through vast computer networks), we already see the shift of Bitcoins from China to the USA and Canada. ""Developing nations such as El Salvador and India are racing towards embracing Bitcoin, and leap-frogging  past first world countries. ""That all requires a highly-skilled and tech-savvy workforce. With all the universities and existing tech companies in UK and the south west it is ideally suited to capitalise on that opportunity."" Both men spoke after recent figures from the Office for National Statistics revealed that the region has the joint slowest growing research and development (R&D) workforce in the country. Investment in the sector is a key driver of growth and seen as vital to improving living standards in the current cost of living crisis. Figures from the ONS revealed that the number of R&D jobs in the south west has climbed just 43.8% over the past decade - less than a fifth of London's figure. The region's M4 corridor has had some success in attracting tech companies including Dyson, Just Eat and Huawei. But they have not delivered the number of highly-skilled and paid jobs to push the area up the list and is currently sits joint-bottom. Crypto is also increasingly used in ""play-to-earn"" games that are built on blockchain technology. Mr Sim - who has himself invested in play-to-earn game ETHEKing.io - says it has sparked a ""paradigm shift, which will revolutionise the gaming industry"". He believes this gaming mechanism is ""only going to explode and grow exponentially, with more and more brands jumping on the bandwagon, as the investors and gamers flood in."" University of the West of England (UWE) lecturer Xiaojun Luo agrees that crypto could ""further stimulate"" the area's economy. She thinks that ""appropriate regulations are needed to reduce the volatility of cryptocurrencies, protect consumers from illicit activities"" and generate a new source of government revenues. Dr Luo explained that ""adopting suitable regulations"" makes the market more liquid and would ""further enhance the ability of participants to buy and sell crypto assets"".  ""The higher transaction rate of crypto assets can further stimulate the south west economy."" Currently the University of Bristol and UWE both offer degrees in Fintech so have students familiar with the sector, blockchain programming and international banking and finance law. But Dr Carr - a lecturer at the University of Exeter - is not convinced that any of this would help spread wealth despite some crypto-proponents wishing to do so. He said that while remote working could benefit the south west, the ""knock on effect"" could be that the jobs are outsourced abroad. He added: ""I am doubtful on the wealth spreading, though I sincerely hope so. ""Regulation may help, but at the moment the crypto markets are heavily influenced by 'whales' who have enough money to effectively pump and dump any coin.  ""There is still plenty of things like that going on."" He urged universities in the area to create developers and coders by running courses which ""teach people how to build these technologies themselves, even if that is not their intended career path"". However the problem is that universities ""can't or don't want to"" compete financially with what top quality blockchain creators can earn in the commercial world.

Volatility,"America, China and tech's next step",2024-09-25,2019-01-10,By Dave Lee,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-46819325,"In a corner of the Las Vegas Convention Center, a row of Huawei Mate 20 smartphones are lined up, sparkling, for CES delegates to try out. It's a typical scene at the trade show but one made slightly surreal by the fact that few Americans will likely ever own these phones. Right now, US networks don't offer any Huawei smartphones, because US security services are worried they could be used for Chinese surveillance. And yet, Huawei has still decided to promote itself at CES in some force - at a time when the company's chief financial officer faces possible extradition to the US over accusations of bank fraud. And in a climate where US-China trade relations are at boiling point. ""It makes business sense for them to come here,"" says Gary Shapiro, chief executive of the Consumer Technology Association, which runs CES.  ""Because they can meet their buyers from all around the world. So they want to be here."" But Mr Shapiro may be putting on a bit of a brave face. There are significant indications that some of the best-known Chinese companies have, for this year at least, taken a step back from America's premier tech event. Shenzhen-based ZTE, which had been at CES every year since 2011, was nowhere to be found at this year's show, despite being originally listed as an exhibitor. It has offered no explanation as to why, but last year Donald Trump signed an order that said ZTE equipment must not be used by the US government, or any company that wants to do public work. While Huawei does have a large stand, no executives are in attendance - a contrast to last year when Richard Yu, one of the firm's most senior figures, was a keynote speaker. This year, not a single Chinese company executive is expected to speak at the show. More broadly, the CTA says it's too early to know whether the precise number of exhibitors from China is up or down on last year, until it carries out its audit of attendees.  It did tell the BBC, however, that in terms of physical floor space, the amount of room taken up by Chinese companies is roughly the same as 2018 - approximately 13-14% of the entire show. The likes of Alibaba, JD.com, Lenovo and DJI are all in prime locations. Earlier this month, a shockwave ripped through the technology industry: Apple announced that its revenues would be significantly lower when it reports its next quarterly earnings.  Chief executive Tim Cook blamed China's economic volatility, and suggested looming US-China trade tariffs are already having an effect. Most analysts predict Apple will not be alone in reporting signs of strain. After all, fewer iPhones sold means fewer iPhones made in China. The complex tangle of supply chains and components sourced from all over the world in some respects makes the notion of an ""American"" or ""Chinese"" phone rather absurd. It's why all technology companies are looking very closely at the outcome of talks between Washington and Beijing. If the two sides are unable to strike a deal by 1 March, the tariffs will be in place. If that happens, the business world will be reassuring itself that a change in leadership might repair the damage. ""I have to say the [Trump] administration's part of the current tensions,"" says Frank Gillet, an analyst with Forrester Research.  ""So, if that administration changes then we're going to have a reset."" More from CES 2019: Even if the trade dispute dissipates, what isn't going anywhere is the growing atmosphere of suspicion between these two global superpowers over how they use their new technology.  This is coming to a head now because of the significant progress made by the Chinese tech industry over the past decade. It has shaken off its reputation as just a source of cheap, high-quality manufacturing, or as an irritating imitator of Western creativity. Huawei took ""Made in China"" and made it ""Designed in China"". High-quality, genuine innovation and a price point that often came in significantly below comparable efforts from Apple.  This has disrupted the smartphone world order. Huawei is currently second only to Samsung when it comes to global smartphone sales. Other Chinese brands like ZTE and Xiaomi are also selling well. Smartphones are just the start. One of the next major innovations is the mass adoption of 5G, a technology that should offer 20 times the download speeds of 4G mobile networks. To get there will require vast amounts of new networking infrastructure - and Huawei has positioned itself as a dominant - if not the dominant - supplier of equipment worldwide. ""Huawei is the only true supplier in 5G,"" says Huawei's security spokesman, Andy Purdy. ""Everyone is else is playing catch-up."" The US government has blocked the use of Huawei's 5G equipment in the country, and has reportedly urged other allies to do the same. Other Chinese firms are subject to bans as well.  Huawei feels the move is anti-competitive. ""From the beginning of 2018 there's been a global drumbeat of hostility by the United States government against Huawei,"" Mr Purdy argues. He adds that current political posturing is preventing progress from being made.  ""It's clear to us that whatever real cyber-security concerns exist regarding products, they can be addressed. But we have to have the conversations to address them."" Mr Purdy argues that globally many countries have embraced Huawei's technology - including the UK, which utilise Huawei products across  So will the US ever be fully open to China's business? It's a question that is becoming harder to answer as China graduates into what is now a hub of innovation that is surpassing the progress of the West in profound ways. When so much of the future is about how we capture and crunch personal data, breakthrough moments in technology - which we look for at CES - are less tangible.  The next big thing may not be a product, but a philosophy. What's more important to a prosperous society: innovation or liberty? ""The Chinese attitude towards privacy is actually helping them advance much more quickly,"" Mr Shapiro says. ""I would defend our European and American approach on liberty and individual rights. But I also think it has to be balanced against the need for innovation and competition."" Read and watch all our CES coverage at bbc.com/ces2019"
Volatility,Fears over risk-taking by cryptoasset investors,2024-09-25,2021-06-17,By Kevin Peachey,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-57509974,"More people are investing in so-called cryptoassets and they are less likely to think they are taking a gamble, the City regulator suggests. The research has prompted a fresh warning from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) that crypto investors risk losing the lot. Some 14% of crypto buyers who were surveyed also said they had borrowed to invest, buoyed by reports of big gains. One analyst described that statistic as ""simply terrifying"". The FCA estimated that 2.3 million adults in the UK now held cryptoassets - the most common of which is cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin. The eye-catching swings in price of these products have drawn in scores of investors, and led to a swathe of marketing. The regulator also noted that whereas nearly half of investors (47%) last year considered their stake in cryptoassets as a gamble, that proportion had now dropped to 38%. Just over half of those who have invested already were considering buying more, the research found. The FCA warned that any problems with these investments were not covered by the usual safety nets as they were unregulated assets. ""If consumers invest in these types of products, they should be prepared to lose all their money,"" said Sheldon Mills, from the FCA. Unlike with regulated investments, buyers would not get support from the Financial Ombudsman Service or the Financial Services Compensation Scheme if they were mis-sold crypto or the provider went bust. Laith Khalaf, financial analyst at AJ Bell, said: ""There is a dark underbelly lurking in the figures, which suggests there is still potential for widespread consumer harm.  ""The fact that 14% of crypto buyers have borrowed to invest is simply terrifying. The extreme volatility and uncertain long-term outlook for crypto means holdings can be wiped out, leaving borrowers with nothing but their debt as a memento."""
Volatility,F1's greatest drivers No.1 - Ayrton Senna,2024-09-25,2012-11-20,BBC Sport,https://www.bbc.com/sport/formula1/20324109,"BBC Sport is profiling 20 of the greatest Formula 1 drivers of all time. The BBC F1 team were asked to provide their own personal top 20s, which were combined to produce a BBC list. Veteran commentator Murray Walker provides his own reflections in a video of their career highlights, and chief F1 writer Andrew Benson profiles the driver. This week, number one - Ayrton Senna. Death, perhaps inevitably, has lent Ayrton Senna's legend a romanticised sheen.  The greatness of the man and the brilliance of his driving are remembered easily, the occasional darkness of his psyche perhaps less so. But it does Senna a disservice to honour only part of his legacy. The significance of his achievements cannot be properly understood without a full appreciation of their origins. Probably no driver in Formula 1 history dedicated himself more to his sport, gave more of himself in the unbending pursuit of success. Senna was a force of nature, a powerful combination of spectacular raw talent and sometimes terrifying determination.  He had the good looks of a romantic hero, a charisma that could quieten any room, the eloquence of a poet and a spirituality with which millions felt they could identify. His dark eyes were windows to a soul of complexity and volatility. All that made him into a demi-god in his homeland of Brazil, and admired the world over like few sportsmen before or since. But with that determination, and his own knowledge of just how good he was, came a sense of entitlement that was less attractive and which led him to take actions that put his own life - and the lives of his opponents - at risk. At the height of their rivalry, one of the greatest sport has known, Alain Prost remarked: ""Ayrton has a small problem. He thinks he can't kill himself, because he believes in God, and I think that's very dangerous."" Senna's discourses on the dangers of his profession, though, would suggest he was well aware of his mortality. ""You are doing something that nobody else is able to do,"" he once said. ""(But) the same moment that you are seen as the best, the fastest and somebody that cannot be touched, you are enormously fragile. Because in a split second, it's gone. ""These two extremes are feelings that you don't get every day. These are all things which contribute to - how can I say? - knowing yourself deeper and deeper. These are the things that keep me going."" Few, if any, racing drivers have ever spoken like this, giving a glimpse into the philosophical demands of their job and - just as importantly - showing they are fully conversant with them. Fittingly, Senna drove from the beginning to the end of his career as if he was determined to test the limits of human endeavour and physical capability. Long before it became apparent that he was an extraordinary human being, it was blindingly obvious that he was an extraordinary talent in a racing car. His record in the junior formulae meant his arrival in F1 was highly anticipated, and in his debut season, with the Toleman team in 1984, he did not disappoint. At Monaco, his sixth race, came the first proper glimpse into the driver who would dominate his era. In the pouring rain, Senna climbed up from 13th on the grid to close rapidly on leader Prost, only to be denied victory when the race was stopped at half-distance, with Senna on the Frenchman's tail. After further strong performances, he was offered a drive with Lotus for 1985. Senna, showing the ruthlessness that would become all too apparent, took it, despite having a further two years to run on his contract. The Lotus was not the fastest car that year, but Senna put it on pole seven times in 16 races. His first victory came in only his second race with the team - again in the wet, this time at Estoril in Portugal.  Two more years at Lotus established him as arguably the fastest man in F1, and in 1988 he joined McLaren, taking Honda engines with him, to make a super-team with Prost. To be the best - and prove it to the world - was Senna's driving force. Prost, as the recognised yardstick at the time, was the man he needed to beat to prove it, and Senna went to the limits of both his ability and acceptability - and beyond - to do so. The resulting rivalry has passed into legend. Prost's excellence drove Senna to new heights, and some of the things the Brazilian achieved as a result almost beggar belief.  His career coincided with the infancy of on-board cameras, and they bore witness to a commitment on his qualifying laps that was both awe-inspiring and chilling. Most famous, perhaps, was a qualifying session at Monaco in 1988, when Senna took pole from Prost by a staggering 1.427 seconds. He later spoke of a kind of out-of-body experience, describing his driving in a metaphysical manner.  McLaren dominated the 1988 season like no-one has before or since - winning 15 of the 16 races, with Senna taking eight to Prost's seven, and clinching the title with a dazzling comeback drive in Japan. But the relationship between the two drivers, always fragile and wary, broke down completely the following year after Senna reneged on an agreement not to pass into the first corner at the San Marino Grand Prix. Any trust there had been was gone. The 1989 title was decided in a collision between the two at Suzuka in Japan, and by a controversial decision by Jean-Marie Balestre, the president of F1's governing body, to disqualify Senna from the subsequent victory that would have kept the championship alive. The sense of injustice from that incident burned inside Senna for a year - until the following year's championship came to its climax, also in Japan. This time, there was no debate about whose fault the resulting crash was. Senna, smarting from Balestre's decision not to move pole position to the advantageous side of the track and believing there was a conspiracy against him, simply drove into the back of Prost's Ferrari at the first corner at 160mph. Senna painted himself as the wronged man, but in seeking to justify the crash he dissembled. ""We are competing to win and if you no longer go for a gap, you are no longer a racing driver,"" he said, failing to mention that the move was never truly on. He finally admitted it was deliberate a year later. The crash ensured Senna won his second title, and he added a third in 1991, founded on four straight wins in the opening races. One of them was among his greatest ever - holding on in the wet in Brazil with only sixth gear, pushing himself so far that he collapsed in agony afterwards. Through 1992-3 he was generally helpless against the all-conquering Williams-Renaults of first Nigel Mansell and then Prost. But he was never better than in the second of those years, his final season with McLaren. Raging against the odds, he took five superb victories, the zenith at Donington Park, when he was - yet again - on a separate level from anyone else. Ayrton Senna on his way to victory for McLaren at the 1990 Monaco Grand Prix Senna finally got his hands on a Williams in 1994, and he was expected to carry all before him. But with the car's driver aids all now banned, and a design flaw in its front wing, it was initially a handful.  It took all his genius to put it on pole for the opening race of the season in Brazil, but in the race he was helpless against the faster Benetton of Michael Schumacher and Senna suffered the ignominy of spinning out as he tried to catch the German. He failed to finish the second race, too, knocked out at the first corner, and then at Imola, fighting to stay ahead of Schumacher, he crashed at the 190mph Tamburello corner. He should have walked away - several drivers before him had done so after accidents at the same place. But a suspension arm pierced his helmet and caused fatal head injuries. Senna's death at the age of 34 left behind memories of a multi-faceted and complex man who was so much more than a racing driver. He took his profession to a new level of commitment and operated on a plateau beyond reach of his rivals at a time when the field was perhaps as strong as ever.  He preached morality but was prepared to abandon it in pursuit of ambition and his own sense of justice.  He talked eloquently of his own mortality, but tested its limits with his almost every action in a racing car.  All this, coupled with his humanity, character and intelligence, gave him and his sport an appeal to millions beyond its normal demographic. Senna was, as James Hunt once put it, ""a truly staggering talent"".

The 39-year-old, who last won a major in 2008 and took a break from the sport to work on his game earlier this year ended his opening round one over par. ""I'm still in it. I'm only nine back. We have a long way to go,"" the four-time Masters champion said. ""I felt good out there. I hit the ball well enough to shoot three under par."" In a poll of 103 Tour professionals before the tournament, 68 stated Woods would not add to his haul of majors and the volatility of his bogey-birdie-par-bogey start through four holes offered little confidence. But despite one three-putt, he scrambled well around the greens to offer at least some response to scrutiny of his chipping prior to his 64-day break from competitive play. ""It's my strength again,"" said Woods, who won the last of his Masters titles in 2005. ""That's why I've busted my butt. That's why I took time off. That's why I hit thousands and thousands of shots to make sure that it's back to being my strength.""

Volatility,'Scotland's greatest ever lefty ready for biggest stages',2024-09-25,2019-11-18,Iain Carter,https://www.bbc.com/sport/golf/50460825,"Robert MacIntyre showed his promise at Royal Portrush, finishing tied sixth on his Open debut Young Scot Robert MacIntyre provides a compelling subplot when the European Tour season reaches its climax in the Middle East this week. The 23-year-old from Oban is on the verge of completing a sensational debut campaign on the main circuit - leading the charge to be crowned top newcomer and claim the prestigious Rookie of the Year title. It has been a remarkable season for the left-hander. Indeed he must already be regarded as the finest Scottish ""lefty"" golf has ever seen. It is a struggle to recall any others who have made such an impact at the top of the game. MacIntyre has climbed 174 places in the world rankings during a year that has yielded seven top 10s, including successive runner-up finishes at the British Masters and Made in Denmark events in early summer. The burly Scotsman was also second at the European Open, but arguably his finest performance came on his major debut when he was tied sixth at The Open at Royal Portrush. With rounds of 68, 72, 71 and 68 he showed a promising taste for the big time, finishing only four strokes behind Tommy Fleetwood, who was a distant second to runaway champion Shane Lowry. No wonder MacIntyre was bursting with pride after finishing his Open debut with a birdie to go five under par.  ""I'm proud of the way I handled the whole week,"" he said. ""From start to finish, from my preparation all the way through to the last putt."" MacIntyre was in good company, sharing sixth spot with former Masters winner Danny Willett, another Englishman Tyrell Hatton and US Ryder Cupper Rickie Fowler. Not bad for a former Scottish amateur champion and someone who is now his country's leading player in the global standings. He is also Scotland's only representative in the season-ending DP World Tour Championship this week. The Cut podcast: The end of the race and Hatton's anger management MacIntyre closed his second round at the Nedbank Challenge in South Africa with a quadruple bogey but battled back to finish eighth Those who know him best talk of his quiet determination. He certainly has an X-factor that brings his best golf to the fore when it is most needed. Last year he was the wrong side of the cutline in the penultimate event on the Challenge Tour. His European Tour card was not yet sealed and he needed something special. MacIntyre duly despatched a 270-yard three wood to 15 feet and holed the putt to make the weekend, before storming to second spot behind Frenchman Victor Perez, who coincidentally is one of his rivals for the rookie award this week. And the Scot comes into the finale at Jumeirah Golf Estates in fine form. MacIntyre was seventh in Turkey at the start of this month and last week recovered brilliantly to finish eighth at the Nedbank Challenge in South Africa. MacIntyre makes big noise at Royal Portrush Lawrie: Young Scottish stars can compete at top My golf swing comes from shinty - MacIntyre Closing rounds of 65 and 68 at the Gary Player Country Club were emblematic of the fighting qualities of the legendary host at Sun City.   Mr Player would surely have approved when MacIntyre recovered so stirringly after ending his second round with a quadruple-bogey nine. He might have wilted the next day but instead embarked on a devastating spell of eight birdies in 14 holes.    His high finish helped the Scot leapfrog American Kurt Kitayama, his closest rival for the rookie crown. Intriguingly, these two newcomers sit 11th and 12th in the Race to Dubai and are destined to partner each other in the first round on Thursday. Both want to claim the Sir Henry Cotton Rookie of the Year award and join the likes of Jon Rahm, Brooks Koepka, Sergio Garcia, Nick Faldo and Sandy Lyle in landing the coveted accolade. ""Winning Rookie of the Year would mean everything,"" MacIntyre said after his spirited finish in South Africa. ""That's what you play golf for - the rewards."" Indeed, MacIntyre could compete for the $5m (£3.8m) bonus pool, which will be split by the top five money-earners in the Race to Dubai. There is a world record $3m waiting for the tournament winner at this lucrative season finale. Tommy Fleetwood's victory at Sun City moved him up to second in the Race to Dubai standings It creates an intriguing climax with Fleetwood leaping into second place in the Race behind Bernd Wiesberger after the Englishman's superb victory in South Africa last Sunday. With all that money at stake, there is room for much volatility in the final standings. Rahm is third on the list, Lowry fourth, with Matt Fitzpatrick and Rory McIlroy lurking in fifth and sixth places. Others who may have a say in the division of the end-of-season spoils include the English pair of Hatton and Matt Wallace. The money is of secondary importance to MacIntyre, though, because a high finish this week would bring a bucketful of world ranking points, which could see him knock off his prime objective for the rest of the year. ""The ultimate goal is to try to get into the world's top 50 before Christmas,"" he says. ""That would take care of everything for next year."" It would guarantee debut appearances at the Masters, US PGA and US Open.   This former shinty player has already shown he is ready to play on the biggest of golfing stages. He would dearly love to confirm that this week by becoming the European Tour's top newcomer in 2019. Race to Dubai rankings, external"
Volatility,McIlroy withdrawal raises questions and eyebrows,2024-09-25,2013-03-01,Iain Carter,https://www.bbc.com/sport/golf/21638397,"The bookies did not take long to react.  Rory McIlroy's withdrawal eight holes into a miserable second round at PGA National rendered him a 3-1 shot to miss the halfway cut at next month's Masters. This is despite his remaining 6-1 joint favourite with Tiger Woods to win the first major of the year.  The volatility of the world's best golfer is neatly summed up by those contradictory odds. When he is on form he is almost unstoppable - the 23-year-old has already romped away with two majors, each won by eight strokes - but when his game is off he struggles to make any kind of decent score. In the last two years he has missed six cuts and now has failed to go the distance in Florida. McIlroy cites toothache for an inability to focus at the Florida course where he won so impressively last year. He was seven over par for the eight second round holes he completed. His career constant is a capacity to make news. He is a walking headline machine. Not for McIlroy a quiet withdrawal thanks to a dodgy hamstring or sore wrist. Instead there was instant intrigue.  ""There's not really much I can say, guys. I'm not in a good place mentally,"" is what he told reporters as he prepared to leave the tournament car park. Moments later Bailey Mosier, a Golf Channel reporter,, external added to the sense of unease by quoting McIlroy's management team in a tweet: ""Rory's agent: He's not hurt. He's not sick. And he won't answer his phone. I don't know."" Eyebrows were then inevitably raised when a statement was issued on the player's behalf citing toothache for his troubles. McIlroy is the most honest and straight-talking of sporting superstars. Refreshingly he has always told it like it is. So when he says he has ""been suffering with a sore wisdom tooth"", he deserves to have it taken at face value, despite the mysterious comments that went before. ""It began bothering me again last night, so I relieved it with Advil. It was very painful again this morning, and I was simply unable to concentrate,"" McIlroy added in his statement.   He now has 14 days to provide written evidence to the PGA Tour supporting this version of events. The timing of this latest setback, though, could hardly be worse. McIlroy needed to make a decent defence of his title at West Palm Beach to arrest the poor form he has shown with his new Nike clubs. His £74m deal with the manufacturer looks to be weighing heavily at the moment. So far wielding his new blades has brought two 75s in Abu Dhabi, an exit at the first hurdle at the WGC Matchplay and a level-par 70 in the one round he completed at the Honda Classic. Taking into account his Match Play performance, he is approximately 17 over par for the 80 holes he has played. It is not proving easy for him to ""Just do it"". But the malaise seems much more about the player than the equipment he is using.   McIlroy can be prone to dramatic troughs in form. Last season, without a swoosh in sight, he suffered four missed cuts in five events including early departures from his US Open defence, the Players' Championship and the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth. He struggled to a share of 60th place at the Open. Then it all clicked - initially with his fifth place at the WGC event in Akron, Ohio and then his record-breaking win at Kiawah Island in the US PGA, the year's final major. That victory heralded a spell in which he won twice in the Tour's play-off series before taking the DP World Tour title in Dubai in his last event with his old Titleist clubs. This video can not be played Rory McIlroy has been unveiled as Nike's new brand ambassador in Abu Dhabi A similar turnaround can happen again just as quickly. McIlroy has identified a kink in his swing - taking the club back too far on the outside and over compensating on the way back - and his coach Michael Bannon has found ways to put his pupil back on track throughout his career. There is no reason to doubt his ability to do it again. That is not to underestimate the challenge the pair currently face. World number one status, the Nike deal and now this controversy mean the spotlight shines on the Northern Ireland star with uncomfortable intensity. Assuming his troublesome teeth allow him to play, he is guaranteed four rounds at another Florida venue - next week's WGC event in Doral - because there is no cut. It could prove a pivotal week for his 2013 season.  Given how little decent golf he has played this year, McIlroy may be tempted to add Bay Hill to his schedule. Otherwise his only other competitive golf before the Masters will come in Houston a fortnight before the year's opening major. The key is to keep this latest setback in perspective, and the player himself is more likely to achieve that than are most of his critics.   A price of only 6-1 to win the Masters and be three-quarters of the way to a career grand slam before his 24th birthday is not the most attractive punt.  But it still represents a better bet than the odds on offer for an early exit from Augusta. McIlroy walks off course in US McIlroy off the pace in Florida McIlroy delighted by sponsorship deal.

Volatility,Has Israel's invasion of Gaza begun?,2024-09-25,2023-10-28,By Jeremy Bowen,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67248454,"Israeli forces appear to be concentrating on the northern area of the Gaza Strip, in Beit Hanoun, and pushing down a bit further south from there. I am in Sderot, the Israeli border town overlooking Gaza.  Continuous heavy artillery fire into Gaza continues.  The Israeli battery near here is firing several times a minute.  The town itself is almost deserted.  Most civilians have either left or been evacuated.  The Israeli army has said it is upping the tempo of operations.  We have seen from video that has emerged from Gaza on Saturday morning, and from what could be seen along the border area on Friday night, evidence of a very, very large bombardment.  But the communications blackout means it's very hard to find out exactly what's going on.  For example, I have spoken to the UN who have been able to communicate with their main office in the south over a satellite phone, but as there is no internal communication, they can't connect with their area offices that look after their aid operations - currently suspended completely - to see how they are doing.  While the bombardment is very focused on the north, the Gaza Strip is only about 45km long (28 miles), so you can hear the extent of the explosions for miles around and certainly throughout the area.  As I understand it, the Israeli army is most likely attempting to clear out tunnels, probably with special forces spotting targets for those air force attacks.  Tanks can be more vulnerable in daylight so they may pull some of those back.  But as far we can tell, it is still going on. Is it a ground offensive? I don't think we should get too hung up on the definitions of all of this. When we saw the military build-up, the mobilisation of over 300,000 reservists, we thought we would be seeing an all-fronts invasion of Gaza.  I think what they may be doing, though, is clearing areas of Gaza slice by slice. I have felt from the tone of comments from the Israeli army that their emphasis was that they would continue pushing, and that this was about ""payback"".  I think you could call this a very extended raid, or a ground offensive. It is certainly a very large military operation. Israel's push on the ground is certain also to be killing Palestinian civilians.  The more Palestinians they kill the greater the outrage elsewhere in the Middle East, in countries friendly to Israel as well as its enemies.  That doesn't guarantee the war will spread. But it increases volatility and uncertainty in a region that is already fragile. "
Volatility,The workers laid off for the first time,2024-09-25,2023-01-16,Megan Tatum,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20230113-the-workers-laid-off-for-the-first-time,"Getting your job cut can be jarring, to say the least. But for workers who’ve never been through layoffs, it can sting particularly badly. Shamari Coleman never considered herself a person who’d get laid off. But in December 2022, shortly after taking a product-marketing position at multinational tech firm AvePoint, the 28-year-old found herself without a job. “I loved the team I was working with and the culture that was fostered there,” says New York City-based Coleman. “It was my first taste of working at a big tech company, and I felt like I’d be there as long as they’d have me.” But five months later, she woke up to an email from the CEO, announcing they’d decided to lay off 5% of their workforce. All Coleman could do was wait to see if she was affected. “A few hours later, I was invited to a meeting with someone from HR and a department manager, and that was that.”  The layoff was unexpected, of course, but the possibility she could be axed in the current climate wasn’t unfathomable, she says. “I was always uneasy, because working in the tech industry, I’d been seeing post after post since around May that year of people getting laid off. It was always in the back of my mind.” Indeed, according to layoffs.fyi, which has tracked tech layoffs globally since the pandemic, more than 150,000 people were laid off in 2022, across more than 1,000 tech companies.  Still, being jobless shook Coleman’s self-confidence. Having graduated with a degree in political sciences in New York, she’d immediately set her sights on the tech sector, working with early-stage start-ups in San Francisco for nearly two years before finding this large tech job. “I was the person that would go out and get interviews and get offers or leverage offers. I felt like I was always in control of my career, and this was the first time I felt like I wasn’t.” Like Coleman, many people affected by the layoffs that have swept the globe in the past 12 months have never faced redundancy before. Lots of these workers have been ambitious high achievers at top firms, who are now confronted by the brutal reality that hard work and talent isn’t always enough. Beyond scrambling to re-think career plans, some workers have found their confidence dented in an unexpected way. Yet it’s not all bad news. ‘What do I do with myself now?’ It isn’t surprising that Coleman was left with a shaken sense of identity after being laid off, says Paula Allen, global leader and senior vice-president of research and total wellbeing at Canadian HR- and tech-firm LifeWorks. “For anyone, being laid off is difficult … But for people early in their career who have always been high achievers, it can be particularly hard, because there’s a feeling they’ve always been in control of their destiny – that they’re the one that people want,” she says. As a result, they’re left questioning what they may have done or how they might have performed differently. But that often has no value, adds Allen. “You’re not going to find any insights, because you didn’t do anything wrong.” Even workers who understand their layoffs weren’t personal in nature can experience these ripple effects. Toronto-based Stella Alexandrova had been at Canadian e-commerce company Shopify for three-and-a-half years when she found out she was one of roughly 1,000 employees laid off by the firm in July last year. “It was my dream job and my dream company,” she says of her role as a growth lead. “Getting that job had felt like the next big step in my career.” In the days leading up to the cuts, she and her team had been busy working to deadlines and pursuing leads. So, when the email arrived in her inbox on a Tuesday morning, just after she’d rolled out of bed and was sipping coffee at her desk, she was shocked that her time there was abruptly over. “It’s like, what do I do with myself now?” she says. “We’d started to hear about other tech layoffs, but you just don’t think you’ll be affected until you are. It wasn’t expected in any way.” Having never experienced redundancy before, her head was initially full of questions about why she’d been chosen. “You start thinking, did something happen? I didn’t think I’d done anything that meant it could be based on my performance. And that was confirmed later. My whole team was part of the layoff. But you can't help to initially question whether it was performance-based, and that does shake up your confidence.” Being laid off can also be a financial blow, of course – and often even more so for those laid off for the first time, who may not have significant savings or experience of how to navigate a sudden loss of income; or for highly skilled workers, for whom being laid off was completely unexpected. Coleman had been contributing to multiple savings accounts since 2020, as part of a personal goal to become more financially savvy, and felt “financially OK” when the her layoff hit in December. Still, the loss of income was still a source of anxiety. “There’s a general sense of worry of, will I have a new role before this money runs out? As of right now, though, I’m doing OK.” In some cases, generous severance packages might also mitigate anxiety around a loss of income, says Dion McKenzie, co-founder of non-profit talent network Colorintech, headquartered in London. “But there’s definitely a financial impact. Let’s face it – younger people coming in at entry level, or with perhaps three-to-five years’ experience, don’t necessarily have a windfall,” says McKenzie. “That, in addition to the cost-of-living crisis definitely carries a financial burden, especially as a lot of these salaries are composed of [stock] options, which are now underwater and undervalued.” ‘Put yourself first’ Once the initial shock has subsided and people start to consider their next move, the impact of being laid off can manifest differently. For some, there’s a lingering uncertainty around putting themselves back out there in the jobs market. “For some people, this loss – of control, of income, of their expectations in terms of work identity – is extraordinarily traumatic,” says Allen. “It changes them. It changes how they approach work.” They may become obsessive over-achievers working 100-hour weeks, or develop significant anxiety in their next role, Allen adds. Coleman felt nervous about finding her next job in the tech sector. “It affected my confidence. The current tech market is fiercer than any other market I’ve worked in, and I’m not only competing with a small group of people now, but with those that were at Meta and Twitter and were also laid off. It’s a fight between that feeling of insecurity and realising that I’m qualified and capable, too.” It's also changed the way Coleman looks at potential opportunities. While it hasn’t explicitly deterred her from looking for a job in tech, despite its volatility, she says, “it's taught me to always do what's best for you, and put yourself first, because these companies will always put themselves and their bottom line first”. The experience will leave many reprioritising and rethinking their careers, adds McKenzie. They may question the job security at tech giants, and also consider early-stage start-ups with recent funding injections a safer bet. “You might also be looking more closely for companies with better foundations – i.e. profitability and growth rates that are increasing,” he says. “Or considering safer industry bets, such as financial services and consulting. Those companies will pay a huge package to convince a Google engineer to join their business.”   Silver linings  Despite the negative effects of being cut for the first time, many of these workers say losing their jobs has not been all bad news. Like Coleman, Alexandrova, too, says the layoff has changed her perspective on careers. Initially, she felt unsure about her next step. “I took a couple of days to process and figure out what was next for me. Ultimately, I knew there wasn’t anything I could do to change the situation. The only thing I could do was control my reaction.” So, she switched her focus to the potential opportunities, buoyed by a five-month severance package. Now, instead of looking for a new employer, she’s taken the decision to use her severance pay to start her own tech company: travel-app Mave, which she and a team of 11 developers, product designers and engineers are scaling, just six months after her layoff.  “I do think tech will stabilise again, but this way, my fate would be more within my control,” she says. “Anything that happens will be my decision versus someone else’s business decision.” And despite how it ended, Alexandrova also credits her time at Shopify for setting her up for her next step. “They had prepped me to be able to enter this new stage of my life,” she says. Additionally, with layoffs increasingly losing their taboo, there may never have been a better environment to be laid off for the first time. For her part, Coleman was among the workers who felt trepidation about even disclosing she’d been let go. “At first, I contemplated if I even should tell my network and close friends. Or should I hunker down and start interviewing, and then once I get a new job tell everyone what happened,” she says. However, she quickly found support once she shared the newsin a post on LinkedIn. She was met with an outpouring of messages from both her close circle and wider professional network. Sharing her experience publicly has even helped her to overcome a lot of her own negative feelings about being laid off. “I was embarrassed, ashamed and most of all, hurt. [But] I realised there’s nothing to be ashamed of when asking for help, and since making it known that I’m actively looking for work, my network has shown up in myriad ways.” This has included soliciting recommendations on her LinkedIn profile, and reaching out with possible job opportunities and referrals – all of which has given Coleman the confidence to start updating and sending out her CV. She’s optimistic about finding her next role soon. And there may be reason for these laid-off workers to feel positive. McKenzie says despite all the headlines around job layoffs, there are still plenty of opportunities in tech for those workers who’ve been cut, whether it’s for the first time or not. “Although in tech we’re seeing layoffs across the board, it seems to be the larger, more established companies who are downsizing and striving to be leaner orgs. Start-ups who are in growth-mode still need talent and are aggressively hiring to get to their next funding round,” says McKenzie. Ultimately, he says, “the power is with talent”."
Volatility,Why brands are leaving social media,2024-09-25,2023-07-12,Chris Stokel-Walker,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20230712-consumer-brands-leave-social-media-meta-threads,"As new social media apps including Threads pop up, some companies are choosing to eschew the platforms. What’s going on? Another day, another social media platform to post on. The launch of Threads on 6 July marked the latest major short-form text platform available to social media users, following Twitter, Mastodon and Bluesky – plus a raft of other, smaller competitors. Like many of us, big companies are struggling to keep up with the number of social media platforms vying for their time and attention. They’re faced with the important choice of which apps to choose, in a market where social media can be an important brand-building tool and enable them to target consumers where they are most active. For the past decade, It’s been all but required for serious brands to maintain a social media presence, says Nathan Allebach, creative director at Allebach Communications, which has partnered with brands including Utz Snacks and Steak-umm to build out their social media presences. Not only is it a major avenue to meet consumers, but social media is also a key contributor for brand discovery – which companies hope will translate into sales across generations of shoppers. Yet instead of scrambling to claim digital real estate across all these newly emerging platforms, some companies are choosing to be more judicious about which platforms they choose to join. In some cases, they’re learning from brands who jumped the social media ship years ago. Bullying and polarisation One of the first large brands to make the move was Lush Cosmetics, which in November 2021 decided to stop posting on social media platforms controlled by Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. The beauty company initially dropped off the platforms in 2019, due to concerns about fighting with ever-changing social media algorithms as well as the company’s worry about the potentially negative impact of social media on young people. “We are a social brand, and community has been key for us,” says Annabelle Baker, Lush’s global brand director. “When we joined social media, Facebook and those platforms were everything we were looking for initially: they were direct links to the communities.” But Baker says they withdrew when social media changed to being inherently less social and user-centric, mediated instead by algorithms controlled by companies. Although Lush re-emerged on the platforms during Covid-19 in order to reach customers during lockdowns, the beauty brand has now gone dark again. They’ve been off social media for almost two years – and don’t have current plans to come back. Time, say social media experts, is a driver pushing away brands: it can be a tall task to ask often junior employees to keep tabs on so many platforms. It’s a situation that has become more pressing with the new boom in Twitter alternatives, where a clear winner hasn’t yet emerged. But some brands have also been feeling a distinct sense of unease about social media in general. First, like Lush, some companies are unhappy about the way the platforms operate and their management. But perhaps more pressing is the risk of followers turning on brands amid the volatility and toxicity of some social media user bases. As social media has polarised society in unexpected ways, brands have found many users quick to criticise an account they believe has mis-stepped. When luxury fashion brand Bottega Veneta left much of social media in 2021, its creative director Daniel Lee cited  “a mood of playground bullying on social media”. He told The Guardian: “I don’t want to collude in an atmosphere that feels negative. ” “The main utility of an organic social media presence for most brands is activating the 1% of their super fans and haters. Ultimately, every team has to assess the risk-reward ratio of how much to invest … the investment isn’t worth it to every brand, especially with how many platforms there are to consider and how precarious they can be,” says Allebach. To join or not to join? The launch of Threads has brought the stay-or-go conversation back to the forefront. Along with audiences already on other emerging platforms, Meta’s purported Twitter killer already has more than 100 million users, less than a week after it began – in other words, a growing group of potential customers for brands. Yet deciding whether to embrace the new apps is tricky. For one, brands are still struggling with the issues of reputation and user abuse. And some brands may also have concerns with Threads specifically, as Meta has prior precedent of launching apps designed to compete with and supplant existing incumbents (Instagram Reels, for instance, was designed to tackle TikTok), which don’t always succeed. Companies could end up devoting significant resources to building a presence on a platform that disappears in a few months’ time. Brands will make their social media decisions individually – but Allebach says many still ultimately feel pressure to hang a shingle on these new platforms. “At this point, it’s hard to imagine a future where brands start pulling out of social media platforms en masse,” he says. Yet he adds it’s possible we’ll see more brands pulling back, especially if ""they can’t quantify the value or start believing the risks outweigh the rewards”. Lush’s Baker says that her company isn’t eager to leap back into social media with Threads – even with the large audience. “It’ll be a test of time to see whether people stay there and actively use it,” she says. “But I’m not tempted to jump on Threads for the time being.”"
Volatility,The rise of 'finfluencers',2024-09-25,2023-09-18,Katie Bishop,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20230915-should-you-trust-personal-finance-advice-from-a-finfluencer,"A growing number of creators are doling out tips online for how to spend, save and invest. Is it a modern approach to financial literacy – or a big red flag? When Yasmin Purnell started blogging in 2017, she planned to share her experiences of becoming a digital nomad. However, the creative-writing graduate and copywriter soon found visitors to her site were more interested in how she afforded her freelance lifestyle. Noticing the hunger for personal finance advice, UK-based Purnell, now 31, rebranded her website. The Wallet Moth – a blog offering finance and frugal-living advice – was born. ""I shifted into personal finance articles, as my small-but-growing audience expressed more interest in how I had avoided debt in my 20s, how I'd budgeted to have a financial safety net for freelancing and what side-hustles I worked to support being location independent,"" she says. It's the human aspect – sharing personal stories and putting a face to the advice – that makes all the difference, she believes. ""My content doesn't necessarily offer something that is better than traditional financial advice, but people more and more want to connect with someone they can think of as an online friend, versus a faceless company."" Purnell is among the swelling tide of financial influencers: creators feeding a seemingly insatiable desire for content on spending, saving and investing. Throughout the past few years, the popularity of these 'finfulencers' has exploded, with many amassing followings into the millions. A growing part of the global influencer industry, with an estimated market size of a whopping $104bn (£83bn) as of 2022, some of these finfluencers report earning upwards of six-figures as social media presences. Their posts can provide welcome insight into the often-opaque world of personal finance – a world young people specifically are finding harder and harder to see into. Yet if trusting money advice from strangers with murky qualifications gives you pause, there's a reason. A young audience Millions of people log on every day to consume advice from financial influencers. Humphrey Yang, a former financial adviser in his 30s, leads the finfluencer pack with more than 50m likes and 3m followers on TikTok, as of this writing. US-based Yang focuses on personal finance advice, with his most popular videos explaining concepts such as retirement accounts and stock prices. In his most-watched video – more than 14 million views – Yang acts out borrowing an iPhone, selling it and then buying the same model for less a year later in order to explain the concept of short selling. Easily digestible content like Yang's appeals primarily to a young audience, says Radhika Duggal, an adjunct business professor at New York University and the chief marketing officer at fintech company Super. ""With the lack of financial education in schools, Gen Zers are being forced to learn about money on their own,"" she says. ""This is the first economic crisis that younger generations are experiencing, and it's no surprise that they're turning to influencers to ensure that they can make good decisions and weather the current climate."" Connor Campbell, a business finance expert at financial comparison site NerdWallet UK, says successful finfluencers purposely provide an easy entry point into money-related topics. ""Financial influencers tend to create content that is appealing to younger generations, specifically using terminology and examples that relate to pop-culture and simplifying financial terms,"" he says. One example of a simplified financial concept is ""cash-stuffing"", a budgeting method that went viral on TikTok in 2022. The cash-stuffing system advocates for dividing physical cash into folders or envelopes for allotted expenses, such as groceries or hobbies, meaning followers are less likely to overspend. It's not a novel concept, but it is new to many young social media users, especially those with limited personal finance exposure. Content like this is helpful to promote better financial habits among young people, believes Campbell. ""By presenting financial tips in an accessible way, they've improved financial literacy, and invoked a newfound interest in being proactive about where people are putting their money, and ways that they can bump their savings."" Purnell agrees, saying that responses from her readers has been ""overwhelmingly positive"", and that people appreciate her advice on living more frugally. She believes that the relatability of her content, combined with the simplicity of her advice, is a winning formula for young viewers. ""I'm just another person looking to save money and perhaps try out a side-hustle or two,"" she says. Experts or regular people? Yet although creators say audiences have been highly receptive to their tips, experts caution some finfluencers may also be leading followers astray – and even, in some cases, taking advantage of them. ""Some of these influencers are just regular people with no background in finance,"" says Campbell. ""Social media can cause people to rush into making uninformed decisions due to a fear of missing out on something that a lot of other people are participating in – and when these trends involve real money, this can sometimes become an issue."" Experts have recently warned of surges in self-directed investing based on questionable guidance from financial influencers, arguing some of these social media stars are offering poor advice, either because of their own lack of financial knowledge, or because it is in their interest to post increasingly outlandish content in the interest of gaining followers. In some cases, organisations have accused personal finance content creators of leveraging the vulnerabilities of a debt-ridden generation to boost their own follower counts. Last year, the UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) warned against online promotions focused on paying off debt, saying that influencers involved in these posts were attracting ""vulnerable or indebted customers"" to follow ""misleading"" financial advice. Offering questionable personal finance advice to capture a large audience has been an issue for decades. Finance mega-stars, many of whom have built profitable careers with their money-management tips, have found themselves in hot water in the past. For instance, Suze Orman, a high-profile TV personality, has come under fire for endorsing questionable financial products, and was even accused of fraud in 2009. Now, however, social media is exposing a larger, younger and often less-educated audience to often unvetted personal finance advice. There's also the added complication of how influencers make their money – social media stars often endorse products for payment, meaning their advice may not be objective. In particular, the rise in cryptocurrency adverts have raised flags, after high-profile cases of influencers endorsing new crypto products. The volatility of cryptocurrency means that it can be difficult to predict the market – and yet many social media users have been led to believe that digital currencies are a good investment. Last year, Kim Kardashian found herself under the microscope when she posted about cryptocurrency Ethereum Max. Although Ethereum saw a rapid rise in 2021, it quickly crashed, losing 97% of its value by January 2022. Investors who had suffered huge losses brought a lawsuit against Kardashian (who currently has more than 364m Instagram followers) and other celebrities who promoted the product, claiming that they had conspired to inflate the value of the tokens. The case was eventually thrown out, but the judge warned of ""celebrities' ability to readily persuade millions of undiscerning followers to buy snake oil with unprecedented ease and reach"". 'Boring but highly effective' James Beckett, 33, launched a content side-hustle after noticing how much bad investment advice was circulating online. The former social media marketer, whose YouTube channel has a small but growing following of several thousand subscribers, says many financial influencers know that engagement comes from get-rich-quick schemes and flaunting their supposed wealth. ""TikTok has reduced our attention spans to fractions of a second, and you need flashy investing content to capture an audience,"" says Beckett, based in Hertfordshire, UK. Beckett isn't the only one worried about too-good-to-be-true schemes and investment scams. Finance industry professionals and organisations have also started to speak out about these issues, and the FCA recently proposed a crackdown on finfluencers, arguing their advice can be misleading, and that they often ""have little knowledge of what they're promoting"". However, Beckett believes he and many finfluencers like him also provide what he describes as ""boring but highly effective"" financial advice. He says these tips are not only lower risk but also more reliable – he discusses the ins and out of concepts including passive investing and index funds – especially for young people without a strong financial-education background or lots of money to burn. Beckett argues social media finance content can offer an accessible way into managing money, without having to pay the high fees many financial advisors or organisations demand. ""Financial influencers can be problematic, because some of them prey on people's naivety,"" he says. ""But on the flip side, there are a lot of people doing good out there, and they are filling a huge gap left by our education system."" Proceeding with caution Without a regulatory body, the world of finfluencing remains somewhat murky. For many, finfluencers have led to accessible financial guidance, filling a gap in financial literacy among young people. And even amid questionable advice or worrying tactics, Campbell argues that, if paired with a discerning attitude and a little bit of scepticism, finfluencers can help put people on the path to responsible money management. ""Personal finances are – as the name suggests – personal to the individual, and everyone's circumstances are different,"" he says. ""It's important to assess whether an influencer's suggestions are relevant to your financial situation."" Beckett adds that although finfluencers might have a bad reputation, they can also offer a route into the confusing, and sometimes intentionally opaque, world of finance and investing. Objective influencers, who don't cash in on partnerships or present their advice as bulletproof, can be a force for good, especially for followers who've never thought about savings or growing wealth. ""Like everything in the world, there are good finfluencers and bad ones,"" he says. ""While the most obnoxious, audacious creators have a larger tendency to go viral, you can still find fantastic personal finance content on social media platforms from people who genuinely want to help. Finfluencers aren't worth shunning entirely."""

Volatility,Market volatility and supply issues delaying A6 upgrade,2024-09-25,2022-09-08,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-62793022,"Supply-chain issues and global-market volatility are delaying the completion of a new road connecting Londonderry and Dungiven, Stormont's Department for Infrastructure (DfI) has said.   The 15-mile dual carriageway is part of the A6 upgrade linking Derry and Belfast. It had been due to be completed earlier this year. DfI said it is ""working closely with the contractor"" to agree a completion date. Speaking to BBC Radio Foyle earlier this week, DUP East Londonderry MP Gregory Campbell criticised the ""contentious delays"" to the upgrade. He was speaking after a weekend of disruption for many residents and businesses in Dungiven, as a main road through the town was closed to allow for resurfacing work.  ""The minister [John O'Dowd] needs to get an edge on this and get this road completed,"" Mr Campbell said. The Department for Infrastructure began work on the A6 road scheme in 2018. Work was completed on the nine-mile (14.7km) dual carriageway between Toomebridge, County Antrim, and Castledawson, County Derry, last year.  The first phase of the carriageway, between the M22 motorway at Randalstown and Toomebridge, opened in 2019. The dual carriageway is part of a larger scheme to improve the route between Derry and Belfast, with work continuing on a major new road between Derry and Dungiven. Starting at the village of Drumahoe, the 15-mile section of dual carriageway includes a bypass around Dungiven. The whole scheme is expected to cost about £220m, according to the Department for Infrastructure. The Department said it was anticipated the scheme ""could be completed by Spring 2022"", but the Covid-19 pandemic ""had a major impact"" on its progress. The DfI said various activities had been disrupted due to ""social distancing requirements, staff absences and issues associated with the supply chain"".   ""Ongoing global market volatility has also impacted the scheme delivery,"" they said.   A spokesperson for the department said staff and contractors had continued to progress the strategically important project ""despite the exceptional challenges"". It was a weekend of disruption for many residents and businesses in Dungiven, as a main road through the town was closed to allow for resurfacing work.  It will be closed again by the Department for Infrastructure this coming weekend as well, for more resurfacing work to be carried out. ""There were problems last weekend because the road was closed at the Dungiven end, and that is going to be repeated this weekend,"" Mr Campbell said.  ""Then, at the other end of the road, at Drumahoe, the road will be closed the following weekend, so this is going to go on for the whole of September with still no end date in sight.  ""At the moment, if you're driving on that road, it is single-file traffic, a 40-mile-per-hour speed limit and no overtaking permitted - that is what we have for 17 miles for most of the road."" Mr Campbell said motorists in the north west need answers.  ""Everyone understands there may be problems. Everyone understands that at some point roads may need to be closed,"" he said.  ""But they need to explain clearly, in straightforward terms, to the travelling public in Dungiven, Drumahoe, Claudy and everywhere in between about what is happening."" The department apologised for the disruption caused to road users and those living in the vicinity. A spokesperson said the roadworks at Dungiven over two weekends were required to complete final surfacing at a new roundabout. ""We are working closely with the contractor to agree a date for completion of the scheme,"" they said."
Volatility,Floods leave farmers with 'unprecedented costs',2024-09-25,2019-11-19,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-50475804,"Widespread flooding has left some farmers in one of England's main crop-growing regions unable to sow seeds for wheat and barley crops. Heavy rainfall in Yorkshire and the East Midlands ""swamped thousands of acres of farmland at a crucial time"", the National Farmers' Union (NFU) said. It said 90% of the winter cereals was expected to be drilled in Lincolnshire, but only 10% had been done. Thousands of homes and businesses have been flooded since 7 November. A spokesperson for the NFU said farmers were facing ""massive and unprecedented costs"" because of the floods. James Peck, from the NFU, said up to 10 inches of rain fell in some parts of Lincolnshire and Nottinghamshire, leaving fields waterlogged.  The current conditions means harvesting root vegetables and crops - including cabbage, broccoli and Brussels sprouts - has been difficult. ""Most arable farmers would have usually drilled all of their winter crops by now, but the relentless rain means some have been unable to drill anything,"" Mr Peck said. ""We also have some potato and vegetable growers who have their crops in the ground only for them to be inundated by floodwater. ""Sugar beet farmers are unable to get machinery on to the wet ground to lift sugar beet.  ""While livestock farmers are being forced to bring in livestock earlier than normal, which means higher costs on-farm for feed and bedding."" Mr Peck added: ""Rainfall on this scale exposes the vulnerability of farming businesses, the fragility of returns to farmers, their exposure to volatility - ultimately resulting in an impact on their bottom line."""
Volatility,Bank of Ireland UK pulls mortgage deals,2024-09-25,2022-09-27,By John Campbell,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63039476,"Bank of Ireland UK is among lenders to temporarily withdraw mortgage products in the wake of financial market turmoil.  The bank said it had withdrawn all residential and buy-to-let rates on Monday and will launch new ranges as soon as possible. The price of UK government borrowing has increased since Friday's budget which has an impact on lenders. Borrowers have been urged to ""act fast"" to secure new deals.  Virgin Money and Skipton Building Society halted mortgage offers for new customers, but said submitted applications would still be processed. Halifax said it would stop mortgages with product fees. Danske Bank, one of the biggest lenders in Northern Ireland, said: ""We are monitoring the competitive landscape closely to ensure our mortgage product offering is in line with the wider market."" The Bank of England said on Monday it would ""not hesitate"" to hike interest rates after the pound hit record lows. The bank's base rate influences borrowing costs across the economy for things like mortgages and personal loans. It said it would make a full assessment as to whether it should change interest rates at its next meeting on 3 November, following speculation it might have intervened earlier. Following Monday's volatility, financial markets updated predictions and said interest rates could now more than double by next spring to 5.8%, from their current level of 2.25%, to curb inflation. Experts said a rise in the cost of long-term borrowing meant the current cost to mortgage lenders of offering new deals was now more expensive.  Owen Peden, managing director at PropertyPal Mortgages in Northern Ireland said people ""were concerned"" but not to panic.   ""We need to educate people to get on the ball and talk to a mortgage broker,"" he said.  ""If your fixed rate is coming to an end in six months, act quick to secure the best rate. ""Prolonging it doesn't help. It's unlikely it's going to get better. I don't have a crystal ball but it looks like rates will get higher."" The Bank of England has already lifted interest rates seven times in a row since December to the highest level in 14 years. If rates continue to increase as forecasted the average household in NI could see an increase of around £200 per month to their mortgage payments, according to PropertyPal.

Volatility,University facing possible £11m energy bill rise,2024-09-25,2023-01-18,By Julia Causton,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-bristol-64292532,"A university says it could be facing an energy bill rise of more than £11m. Steve West, vice chancellor of the University of the West of England (UWE) in Bristol, said costs might be as high as £18m in 2023-2024. He said the price increase would not be passed on to students, despite the impact on the university's budget. ""We're looking at how we can save energy, save costs, but also we're having to look hard about how and where we invest going forward,"" Mr West said. UWE's energy bill for the 2021-2022 academic year was £6.5m, while in 2022-23 it was £10.5million, he added. ""Many universities forward purchase [energy], so we forward purchase two years ahead, and that gives us some security. ""But at the moment the market is so volatile, we're going to see a significant increase. We don't quite know how much and that's a big problem for us,"" said Mr West. He warned the rising energy prices could ""impact on our capital investments going forward"". ""At the moment we're prioritising all of the things we can do to reduce our energy to net zero carbon emissions for the university itself,"" added Mr West. Meanwhile, the University of Bath told the BBC it generated about 10 per cent of its electricity on campus through the use of renewables and mini-power stations. The University of Gloucestershire said its energy rate was fixed every six months so, although it was likely to face significantly higher prices later in the year, it was currently protected from market volatility. While its energy bills have increased ""significantly"", the University of Bristol said they remained a small part of its overall expenditure. It said its priority was to help students who were struggling, via hardship funding. Follow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. Send your story ideas to: bristol@bbc.co.uk"

The Dow Jones Industrial Average and London's FTSE 100 saw their biggest quarterly drops since 1987, plunging 23% and 25% respectively. The S&P 500 lost 20% during the quarter, its worst since 2008. The drops come as authorities order a halt to most activity in an effort to slow the spread of the virus. Economists have warned the hit to the global economy is likely to be worse than the financial crisis, with forecasters for IHS Markit, for example, predicting growth will shrink 2.8% this year, compared to a 1.7% drop in 2009. No country has been left untouched. The data firm expects China's growth to sputter to 2%, while the UK could see growth drop 4.5%. The outlook for countries such as Italy and less developed economies is even worse. ""We remain very concerned about the negative outlook for global growth in 2020 and in particular about the strain a downturn would have on emerging markets and low income countries,"" the president of the International Monetary Fund, Kristalina Georgieva, said on Tuesday. In the US, one central bank analysis suggested the unemployment rate could rise to more than 32% over the next three months, as more than 47 million people lose their jobs. Globally, many indexes remain more than 20% lower than they were at the start of the year. A steep slide in oil prices, due to a drop in demand and a price war between producers, has compounded the problems on financial markets. Governments have pledged massive rescue funds, which has helped to lift share prices in recent days.  On Tuesday, the FTSE gained almost 2%, while Germany's Dax and France's CAC 40 saw more modest gains. But the main US indexes stumbled, with the Dow dropping 1.8%, the S&P 500 down 1.6%, and the Nasdaq off almost 1%. Energy and financial firms were among the worst performers in the quarter. Retailers, which have seen sales evaporate as stores closed, suffered some of the biggest losses on Tuesday, with Macy's down almost 9% a day after it said it would put the majority of its staff on unpaid leave. ""Despite monetary and financial stimulus, we expect volatility of equities to remain elevated as long as the duration and impact of Covid-19 remain unknown, oil prices stay depressed and earnings visibility is murky,"" analysts for US Bank Wealth Management wrote."
Volatility,A6 Derry-Dungiven road 'could open' in late April,2024-09-25,2023-01-31,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-64473982,"The new A6 road between Londonderry and Dungiven could open at the end of April, according to a Department for Infrastructure (DfI) official. The DfI's Kaine Lynch said that was the deadline it was working towards, ""subject to any unforeseen circumstances"".  The 15-mile (24km) stretch is part of the A6 road that links Derry and Belfast.  It was due to open last autumn and there has been frustration over delays. The new stretch of road mostly runs parallel to the existing road and includes a bypass of Dungiven. Speaking to BBC's Good Morning Ulster on Wednesday, Mr Lynch, the DfI's director of major projects and procurement, said he understood the concerns of ""local people and the travelling public"". ""They have waited a long time for the upgrade and understandably want to know when it will open,"" he said.   His comments follow an interview with DUP MP Gregory Campbell on BBC Radio Foyle on Tuesday. He said officials from the department had warned him that, in a worst case scenario, the road would open in July. Mr Campbell also criticised a lack of transparency on the issue.  ""We're now virtually in the spring of '23 and they're still not giving a final deadline,"" he added. Following Mr Campbell's comments, Mr Lynch said a road safety audit was now in process and that the main line construction work was ""now largely complete with the exception of road signs and street lighting connections"". He said ""the end of April"" was the target the DfI was now working towards to open the road to the public.  ""The street lighting connections will be complete within the next fortnight. Now the signs won't be complete until next month, but we are running that road safety audit process in parallel. ""We have already identified minor issues in terms of that road safety project and we are actively working towards those."" The road opened with speed limits and lane restrictions for a short period in summer 2022, but then later closed again as work continued. On Tuesday, the head of a Dungiven community group said there have been two consecutive weekends of major traffic disruption around the town due to the road works.  Mairead McCormack, who is chief executive of Glenshane Community Development, said locals were deeply frustrated by the traffic, with its associated noise and air pollution. ""Last Friday there were two sets of traffic management schemes in Dungiven, with four-mile tailbacks,"" she said. ""There is really no need when you have a perfectly good road that could be open at times like that. ""We're concerned that there's no transparency as to why the bypass has not been opened. We are taxpayers, we should be informed as to why there are issues and what the issues are."" Mr Lynch said there are many factors as to why there has been delays to the road opening, citing the Covid-19 pandemic, the increased costs of building materials and some materials being in short supply. ""We have had supply issues in terms of the signs, we have also had inefficiencies with working in quarantine and all the rest. It's a combination of issues in terms of the delays we are dealing with today."" The department said in a statement: ""The scheme is well advanced and mainline construction work is now largely complete with the exception of a proportion of road signs and street lighting connections. ""We have recently commenced the road safety audit process, which must be completed before the road can be opened. ""Subject to any unforeseen circumstances, the current programme indicates the road could open at the end of April."""
Volatility,Who pays if oil and gas are put into decline?,2024-09-25,2023-06-25,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-66013963,"It didn't take long for the oil and gas industry to show the impact of the UK's political jeopardy. Sir Keir Starmer was in Edinburgh at the start of the week, choosing the symbolism of Leith as a supply centre for offshore wind power and the Scottish capital as a centre for financing the Great Energy Transition. Scotland was more than just symbolic as the location. The policy of refusing any new licences for offshore oil and gas drilling is politically difficult. There are 90,000 Scottish jobs in the industry - fewer than the rest of the UK, but more concentrated in the north-east. Making the case for shutting down the industry is tricky. Sir Keir Starmer's approach was to tell those workers the change is coming anyway, so it's best to do it soon. ""This has to happen eventually,"" he said. ""The only question is when. The moment for decisive action is now. If we wait until North Sea oil and gas runs out, the opportunities this change can bring will pass us by, and that would be a historic mistake."" Within hours, the impact of windfall tax and licence blocks was clear from a statement issued by Parkmead. The oil and gas driller, with a focus on the North Sea, was putting the brakes on a large development to the north-east of Fraserburgh. It faces ""unprecedented challenges associated with volatile oil and gas prices, ageing infrastructure and rising capital and operating costs"", it said. Labour Party hostility to new drilling is just one of many such problems. Parkmead also highlighted the UK government's windfall tax (from which Labour intends to extract more revenue) plus ""loss of key equipment and human resources from the UK North Sea"" and the cost of capital due to rising interest rates. Facing ""very high hurdles"", its board is opting to ""be very careful and selective in its forward UK investment strategy"", so it is focussing on gas rather than oil, and only where they can be developed rapidly, alongside renewable energy assets. So the Perth field, with costs rising to $1bn (£790m) is kyboshed. It would have required deployment of some ""ultra late-life"" assets nearby - meaning pipelines and platforms that are nearing the end of their working lives and are therefore more expensive to keep in operation. Parkmead was looking for industrial partners to share the risk, as is common, known as a farm-out. And ""multiple parties"" were interested. But there were too many concerns over the longevity of nearby infrastructure.  ""In particular, industry concerns were highlighted over the recent numerous fiscal changes which has led to a large increase in effective taxation.  Such an increase materially damages project economics, undermining the usual risk-reward equation associated with making major offshore oil and gas field investment decisions. ""These factors, combined with a lack of public and political support for new oil projects, have resulted in a very cautious and conditional approach from industry during these partnering discussions."" This was an unusually open explanation of why a North Sea driller was not going to do progress a project, along with a statement to investors that the company is taking a £33m hit, as it walks away from the Perth licences. It illustrates that there's a lot working against the future of the offshore oil and gas industry in the UK, and the prospect of an incoming Labour government is just one aspect of that. Parkmead is not against further acquisitions, but its financial rationale is that it has £150m of losses on its books that can be used to offset tax. That makes it attractive to take on assets from those firms which would otherwise face a 75% tax on profits.  And with that background, it is pressing ahead with drilling on the more promising Skerryvore field, also in the central North Sea. There is further evidence of value in the North Sea basin for hydrocarbons, with the sale of another Aberdeen-based driller, Neptune, to the Milan-based ENI oil giant. With assets spread widely but mainly in the UK and Norway, the transaction is worth around $5bn (£3.9bn).  The logic for this deal seems to be ENI's drive towards net zero by 2030. Neptune's assets are big on gas, including the large Cygnus field, and the shift from oil to gas helps reduce the new owner's carbon intensity. But the politics of this, according to Labour policy, is to go harder and faster towards slowing the flow of oil and gas from UK waters.  It sets up a dividing line between Labour and Tory, in which Sir Keir Starmer's compromise with the industry is to let Conservative ministers licence as much as they want before the next Westminster election - and that could be as many as a hundred projects - while Labour promises not to reverse those decisions. The SNP tends towards the Labour position on licensing, but with wiggle room to allow some drilling if it can be mitigated. Under current constitutional arrangements, it won't have the powers to decide, as these lie with Westminster and its agency, the North Sea Transition Authority. Labour's position would make the energy transition one of its biggest commitments and challenges, if it wins the election next year.  It risks a rush, and possibly haste, to grab licences and get to work, when - as Parkmead noted - there are constraints on finance and personnel. The policy risks pleasing nobody, as the campaign to ""keep it in the ground"" sees progress in making it non-viable to keep drilling, and as the Scottish Labour party has to defend its transition plan to those industry workers. A sign of the frustration came from veteran Labour councillor and Aberdeen lord provost, Barney Crockett, who quit the party in disgust. The industry has been campaigning hard to make the case for energy security. Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine and sanctions against Russia, with energy prices soaring last year and now falling back, the case for reducing dependence on imported energy has had a stronger pull. Imports come with a bigger carbon footprint than natural gas piped from UK fields, particularly where they are transported as liquified natural gas.  Prices are no less volatile from domestic production, however. They continue to be set in international markets, and the UK contribution has only a marginal impact. But there is an advantage to domestic production in limiting the bill on foreign exchange. Last year, the import bill doubled to £117bn. Meanwhile, it's seen as likely that the wind-down of the industry globally will leave production increasingly in the hands of those countries which are doing least to limit environmental damage and whose track record as responsible and reliable trading partners is far from ideal. Offshore Energy UK, representing the sector, points to an accelerated decline for UK output if British governments push to put their own production at a disadvantage, either through higher tax or through licence constraints. Big old fields are depleting. Last year, the industry was on course for a rapid acceleration of its decommissioning of equipment, more than doubling the number of jackets and topsides being scrapped, 330 km (205 miles) of pipelines shut down, a rise from 124 to 196 wells decommissioned, and more than trebling the tonnage of subsea equipment removed, to more than 1,100 tonnes. That constrains the opportunity to use such assets for exploiting further fields, as Parkmead noted about its plans for Perth. Maintaining the flow requires new fields to be brought onstream and newer ones discovered. Only 12 recently-opened gas fields account for nearly a third of the UK's gas output. ""The UK's oil and gas fields are in natural long-term decline. UK oil and gas production will never increase and new developments are needed simply to minimise that decline,"" says OEUK. ""UK oil and gas resources occur in multiple small reservoirs which become depleted, so constant investment is needed to develop new sources to replace those are no longer viable. This 'churn' is the only way to maintain production. ""Without such investment, UK oil and gas output would fall around 80% by 2033. This would make the UK even more dependent on imports and increase the 'energy gap' - meaning the difference between what we produce and what we consume."" The industry grouping says that faster decline in production would be at a rate of 15% per year, whereas a scenario with sustained investment would limit it to 8% annual decline. So here's the dilemma. International agreements, and particularly the COP21 Paris summit in 2015, point to a pressing need to stop developing new oil and gas assets. Exploiting the resources already discovered and in production would itself push greenhouse gases beyond the agreed international limits. The move to renewable energy will take time, and until the capacity is there to generate, to transmit and to connect the shift to green electricity from oil-fuelled transport and gas-fuelled heating, the demand for oil and gas is not going away.  Cutting back on supply doesn't, in itself, cut demand. It could help to do so if it pushes up prices, making it more financially attractive to make that shift. But using price as the mechanism is politically difficult. Governments are constrained in how much they can commit to the enormous capital costs required to replace the UK's 24 million gas boilers heating British homes. With higher prices, those least able to pay the capital costs will be those left with the expensive old boilers. Those living in the poorest areas are most likely to be the ones left with the petrol-guzzling cars, furthest from reliable charging points. Asked how energy bills are supposed to be falling by 2030, as it claims they will, Labour's answer is that renewable energy is already cheaper than gas-fired power stations.  But that's for turbines already installed, and the comparison is with gas at recent high prices. For decades to come, bills are going to be paying off the capital costs of many more turbines required, and the wiring to get offshore wind power to customers - itself a logistical and political challenge. Supply chains are stretched, and the industry warns that costs are rising. As we've found in the past year, soaring energy bills only serve to distract people from the Great Energy Transition, while they struggle to get through the current crisis for the household budget. So sequencing is important, to reduce price volatility. The challenge of doing this in a fair, equitable way is a huge one, and choking off supply without a simultaneous path to the transition risks making it worse."
Volatility,"America, China and tech's next step",2024-09-25,2019-01-10,By Dave Lee,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-46819325,"In a corner of the Las Vegas Convention Center, a row of Huawei Mate 20 smartphones are lined up, sparkling, for CES delegates to try out. It's a typical scene at the trade show but one made slightly surreal by the fact that few Americans will likely ever own these phones. Right now, US networks don't offer any Huawei smartphones, because US security services are worried they could be used for Chinese surveillance. And yet, Huawei has still decided to promote itself at CES in some force - at a time when the company's chief financial officer faces possible extradition to the US over accusations of bank fraud. And in a climate where US-China trade relations are at boiling point. ""It makes business sense for them to come here,"" says Gary Shapiro, chief executive of the Consumer Technology Association, which runs CES.  ""Because they can meet their buyers from all around the world. So they want to be here."" But Mr Shapiro may be putting on a bit of a brave face. There are significant indications that some of the best-known Chinese companies have, for this year at least, taken a step back from America's premier tech event. Shenzhen-based ZTE, which had been at CES every year since 2011, was nowhere to be found at this year's show, despite being originally listed as an exhibitor. It has offered no explanation as to why, but last year Donald Trump signed an order that said ZTE equipment must not be used by the US government, or any company that wants to do public work. While Huawei does have a large stand, no executives are in attendance - a contrast to last year when Richard Yu, one of the firm's most senior figures, was a keynote speaker. This year, not a single Chinese company executive is expected to speak at the show. More broadly, the CTA says it's too early to know whether the precise number of exhibitors from China is up or down on last year, until it carries out its audit of attendees.  It did tell the BBC, however, that in terms of physical floor space, the amount of room taken up by Chinese companies is roughly the same as 2018 - approximately 13-14% of the entire show. The likes of Alibaba, JD.com, Lenovo and DJI are all in prime locations. Earlier this month, a shockwave ripped through the technology industry: Apple announced that its revenues would be significantly lower when it reports its next quarterly earnings.  Chief executive Tim Cook blamed China's economic volatility, and suggested looming US-China trade tariffs are already having an effect. Most analysts predict Apple will not be alone in reporting signs of strain. After all, fewer iPhones sold means fewer iPhones made in China. The complex tangle of supply chains and components sourced from all over the world in some respects makes the notion of an ""American"" or ""Chinese"" phone rather absurd. It's why all technology companies are looking very closely at the outcome of talks between Washington and Beijing. If the two sides are unable to strike a deal by 1 March, the tariffs will be in place. If that happens, the business world will be reassuring itself that a change in leadership might repair the damage. ""I have to say the [Trump] administration's part of the current tensions,"" says Frank Gillet, an analyst with Forrester Research.  ""So, if that administration changes then we're going to have a reset."" More from CES 2019: Even if the trade dispute dissipates, what isn't going anywhere is the growing atmosphere of suspicion between these two global superpowers over how they use their new technology.  This is coming to a head now because of the significant progress made by the Chinese tech industry over the past decade. It has shaken off its reputation as just a source of cheap, high-quality manufacturing, or as an irritating imitator of Western creativity. Huawei took ""Made in China"" and made it ""Designed in China"". High-quality, genuine innovation and a price point that often came in significantly below comparable efforts from Apple.  This has disrupted the smartphone world order. Huawei is currently second only to Samsung when it comes to global smartphone sales. Other Chinese brands like ZTE and Xiaomi are also selling well. Smartphones are just the start. One of the next major innovations is the mass adoption of 5G, a technology that should offer 20 times the download speeds of 4G mobile networks. To get there will require vast amounts of new networking infrastructure - and Huawei has positioned itself as a dominant - if not the dominant - supplier of equipment worldwide. ""Huawei is the only true supplier in 5G,"" says Huawei's security spokesman, Andy Purdy. ""Everyone is else is playing catch-up."" The US government has blocked the use of Huawei's 5G equipment in the country, and has reportedly urged other allies to do the same. Other Chinese firms are subject to bans as well.  Huawei feels the move is anti-competitive. ""From the beginning of 2018 there's been a global drumbeat of hostility by the United States government against Huawei,"" Mr Purdy argues. He adds that current political posturing is preventing progress from being made.  ""It's clear to us that whatever real cyber-security concerns exist regarding products, they can be addressed. But we have to have the conversations to address them."" Mr Purdy argues that globally many countries have embraced Huawei's technology - including the UK, which utilise Huawei products across  So will the US ever be fully open to China's business? It's a question that is becoming harder to answer as China graduates into what is now a hub of innovation that is surpassing the progress of the West in profound ways. When so much of the future is about how we capture and crunch personal data, breakthrough moments in technology - which we look for at CES - are less tangible.  The next big thing may not be a product, but a philosophy. What's more important to a prosperous society: innovation or liberty? ""The Chinese attitude towards privacy is actually helping them advance much more quickly,"" Mr Shapiro says. ""I would defend our European and American approach on liberty and individual rights. But I also think it has to be balanced against the need for innovation and competition."" Read and watch all our CES coverage at bbc.com/ces2019"

Volatility,Bank of Ireland UK pulls mortgage deals,2024-09-25,2022-09-27,By John Campbell,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63039476,"Bank of Ireland UK is among lenders to temporarily withdraw mortgage products in the wake of financial market turmoil.  The bank said it had withdrawn all residential and buy-to-let rates on Monday and will launch new ranges as soon as possible. The price of UK government borrowing has increased since Friday's budget which has an impact on lenders. Borrowers have been urged to ""act fast"" to secure new deals.  Virgin Money and Skipton Building Society halted mortgage offers for new customers, but said submitted applications would still be processed. Halifax said it would stop mortgages with product fees. Danske Bank, one of the biggest lenders in Northern Ireland, said: ""We are monitoring the competitive landscape closely to ensure our mortgage product offering is in line with the wider market."" The Bank of England said on Monday it would ""not hesitate"" to hike interest rates after the pound hit record lows. The bank's base rate influences borrowing costs across the economy for things like mortgages and personal loans. It said it would make a full assessment as to whether it should change interest rates at its next meeting on 3 November, following speculation it might have intervened earlier. Following Monday's volatility, financial markets updated predictions and said interest rates could now more than double by next spring to 5.8%, from their current level of 2.25%, to curb inflation. Experts said a rise in the cost of long-term borrowing meant the current cost to mortgage lenders of offering new deals was now more expensive.  Owen Peden, managing director at PropertyPal Mortgages in Northern Ireland said people ""were concerned"" but not to panic.   ""We need to educate people to get on the ball and talk to a mortgage broker,"" he said.  ""If your fixed rate is coming to an end in six months, act quick to secure the best rate. ""Prolonging it doesn't help. It's unlikely it's going to get better. I don't have a crystal ball but it looks like rates will get higher."" The Bank of England has already lifted interest rates seven times in a row since December to the highest level in 14 years. If rates continue to increase as forecasted the average household in NI could see an increase of around £200 per month to their mortgage payments, according to PropertyPal.

Volatility,Market volatility and supply issues delaying A6 upgrade,2024-09-25,2022-09-08,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-62793022,"Supply-chain issues and global-market volatility are delaying the completion of a new road connecting Londonderry and Dungiven, Stormont's Department for Infrastructure (DfI) has said.   The 15-mile dual carriageway is part of the A6 upgrade linking Derry and Belfast. It had been due to be completed earlier this year. DfI said it is ""working closely with the contractor"" to agree a completion date. Speaking to BBC Radio Foyle earlier this week, DUP East Londonderry MP Gregory Campbell criticised the ""contentious delays"" to the upgrade. He was speaking after a weekend of disruption for many residents and businesses in Dungiven, as a main road through the town was closed to allow for resurfacing work.  ""The minister [John O'Dowd] needs to get an edge on this and get this road completed,"" Mr Campbell said. The Department for Infrastructure began work on the A6 road scheme in 2018. Work was completed on the nine-mile (14.7km) dual carriageway between Toomebridge, County Antrim, and Castledawson, County Derry, last year.  The first phase of the carriageway, between the M22 motorway at Randalstown and Toomebridge, opened in 2019. The dual carriageway is part of a larger scheme to improve the route between Derry and Belfast, with work continuing on a major new road between Derry and Dungiven. Starting at the village of Drumahoe, the 15-mile section of dual carriageway includes a bypass around Dungiven. The whole scheme is expected to cost about £220m, according to the Department for Infrastructure. The Department said it was anticipated the scheme ""could be completed by Spring 2022"", but the Covid-19 pandemic ""had a major impact"" on its progress. The DfI said various activities had been disrupted due to ""social distancing requirements, staff absences and issues associated with the supply chain"".   ""Ongoing global market volatility has also impacted the scheme delivery,"" they said.   A spokesperson for the department said staff and contractors had continued to progress the strategically important project ""despite the exceptional challenges"". It was a weekend of disruption for many residents and businesses in Dungiven, as a main road through the town was closed to allow for resurfacing work.  It will be closed again by the Department for Infrastructure this coming weekend as well, for more resurfacing work to be carried out. ""There were problems last weekend because the road was closed at the Dungiven end, and that is going to be repeated this weekend,"" Mr Campbell said.  ""Then, at the other end of the road, at Drumahoe, the road will be closed the following weekend, so this is going to go on for the whole of September with still no end date in sight.  ""At the moment, if you're driving on that road, it is single-file traffic, a 40-mile-per-hour speed limit and no overtaking permitted - that is what we have for 17 miles for most of the road."" Mr Campbell said motorists in the north west need answers.  ""Everyone understands there may be problems. Everyone understands that at some point roads may need to be closed,"" he said.  ""But they need to explain clearly, in straightforward terms, to the travelling public in Dungiven, Drumahoe, Claudy and everywhere in between about what is happening."" The department apologised for the disruption caused to road users and those living in the vicinity. A spokesperson said the roadworks at Dungiven over two weekends were required to complete final surfacing at a new roundabout. ""We are working closely with the contractor to agree a date for completion of the scheme,"" they said."
Volatility,F1's greatest drivers No.1 - Ayrton Senna,2024-09-25,2012-11-20,BBC Sport,https://www.bbc.com/sport/formula1/20324109,"BBC Sport is profiling 20 of the greatest Formula 1 drivers of all time. The BBC F1 team were asked to provide their own personal top 20s, which were combined to produce a BBC list. Veteran commentator Murray Walker provides his own reflections in a video of their career highlights, and chief F1 writer Andrew Benson profiles the driver. This week, number one - Ayrton Senna. Death, perhaps inevitably, has lent Ayrton Senna's legend a romanticised sheen.  The greatness of the man and the brilliance of his driving are remembered easily, the occasional darkness of his psyche perhaps less so. But it does Senna a disservice to honour only part of his legacy. The significance of his achievements cannot be properly understood without a full appreciation of their origins. Probably no driver in Formula 1 history dedicated himself more to his sport, gave more of himself in the unbending pursuit of success. Senna was a force of nature, a powerful combination of spectacular raw talent and sometimes terrifying determination.  He had the good looks of a romantic hero, a charisma that could quieten any room, the eloquence of a poet and a spirituality with which millions felt they could identify. His dark eyes were windows to a soul of complexity and volatility. All that made him into a demi-god in his homeland of Brazil, and admired the world over like few sportsmen before or since. But with that determination, and his own knowledge of just how good he was, came a sense of entitlement that was less attractive and which led him to take actions that put his own life - and the lives of his opponents - at risk. At the height of their rivalry, one of the greatest sport has known, Alain Prost remarked: ""Ayrton has a small problem. He thinks he can't kill himself, because he believes in God, and I think that's very dangerous."" Senna's discourses on the dangers of his profession, though, would suggest he was well aware of his mortality. ""You are doing something that nobody else is able to do,"" he once said. ""(But) the same moment that you are seen as the best, the fastest and somebody that cannot be touched, you are enormously fragile. Because in a split second, it's gone. ""These two extremes are feelings that you don't get every day. These are all things which contribute to - how can I say? - knowing yourself deeper and deeper. These are the things that keep me going."" Few, if any, racing drivers have ever spoken like this, giving a glimpse into the philosophical demands of their job and - just as importantly - showing they are fully conversant with them. Fittingly, Senna drove from the beginning to the end of his career as if he was determined to test the limits of human endeavour and physical capability. Long before it became apparent that he was an extraordinary human being, it was blindingly obvious that he was an extraordinary talent in a racing car. His record in the junior formulae meant his arrival in F1 was highly anticipated, and in his debut season, with the Toleman team in 1984, he did not disappoint. At Monaco, his sixth race, came the first proper glimpse into the driver who would dominate his era. In the pouring rain, Senna climbed up from 13th on the grid to close rapidly on leader Prost, only to be denied victory when the race was stopped at half-distance, with Senna on the Frenchman's tail. After further strong performances, he was offered a drive with Lotus for 1985. Senna, showing the ruthlessness that would become all too apparent, took it, despite having a further two years to run on his contract. The Lotus was not the fastest car that year, but Senna put it on pole seven times in 16 races. His first victory came in only his second race with the team - again in the wet, this time at Estoril in Portugal.  Two more years at Lotus established him as arguably the fastest man in F1, and in 1988 he joined McLaren, taking Honda engines with him, to make a super-team with Prost. To be the best - and prove it to the world - was Senna's driving force. Prost, as the recognised yardstick at the time, was the man he needed to beat to prove it, and Senna went to the limits of both his ability and acceptability - and beyond - to do so. The resulting rivalry has passed into legend. Prost's excellence drove Senna to new heights, and some of the things the Brazilian achieved as a result almost beggar belief.  His career coincided with the infancy of on-board cameras, and they bore witness to a commitment on his qualifying laps that was both awe-inspiring and chilling. Most famous, perhaps, was a qualifying session at Monaco in 1988, when Senna took pole from Prost by a staggering 1.427 seconds. He later spoke of a kind of out-of-body experience, describing his driving in a metaphysical manner.  McLaren dominated the 1988 season like no-one has before or since - winning 15 of the 16 races, with Senna taking eight to Prost's seven, and clinching the title with a dazzling comeback drive in Japan. But the relationship between the two drivers, always fragile and wary, broke down completely the following year after Senna reneged on an agreement not to pass into the first corner at the San Marino Grand Prix. Any trust there had been was gone. The 1989 title was decided in a collision between the two at Suzuka in Japan, and by a controversial decision by Jean-Marie Balestre, the president of F1's governing body, to disqualify Senna from the subsequent victory that would have kept the championship alive. The sense of injustice from that incident burned inside Senna for a year - until the following year's championship came to its climax, also in Japan. This time, there was no debate about whose fault the resulting crash was. Senna, smarting from Balestre's decision not to move pole position to the advantageous side of the track and believing there was a conspiracy against him, simply drove into the back of Prost's Ferrari at the first corner at 160mph. Senna painted himself as the wronged man, but in seeking to justify the crash he dissembled. ""We are competing to win and if you no longer go for a gap, you are no longer a racing driver,"" he said, failing to mention that the move was never truly on. He finally admitted it was deliberate a year later. The crash ensured Senna won his second title, and he added a third in 1991, founded on four straight wins in the opening races. One of them was among his greatest ever - holding on in the wet in Brazil with only sixth gear, pushing himself so far that he collapsed in agony afterwards. Through 1992-3 he was generally helpless against the all-conquering Williams-Renaults of first Nigel Mansell and then Prost. But he was never better than in the second of those years, his final season with McLaren. Raging against the odds, he took five superb victories, the zenith at Donington Park, when he was - yet again - on a separate level from anyone else. Ayrton Senna on his way to victory for McLaren at the 1990 Monaco Grand Prix Senna finally got his hands on a Williams in 1994, and he was expected to carry all before him. But with the car's driver aids all now banned, and a design flaw in its front wing, it was initially a handful.  It took all his genius to put it on pole for the opening race of the season in Brazil, but in the race he was helpless against the faster Benetton of Michael Schumacher and Senna suffered the ignominy of spinning out as he tried to catch the German. He failed to finish the second race, too, knocked out at the first corner, and then at Imola, fighting to stay ahead of Schumacher, he crashed at the 190mph Tamburello corner. He should have walked away - several drivers before him had done so after accidents at the same place. But a suspension arm pierced his helmet and caused fatal head injuries. Senna's death at the age of 34 left behind memories of a multi-faceted and complex man who was so much more than a racing driver. He took his profession to a new level of commitment and operated on a plateau beyond reach of his rivals at a time when the field was perhaps as strong as ever.  He preached morality but was prepared to abandon it in pursuit of ambition and his own sense of justice.  He talked eloquently of his own mortality, but tested its limits with his almost every action in a racing car.  All this, coupled with his humanity, character and intelligence, gave him and his sport an appeal to millions beyond its normal demographic. Senna was, as James Hunt once put it, ""a truly staggering talent"".

Volatility,UK firms pull stock market floats,2024-09-25,2017-11-03,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-41856441,"Arqiva, the UK's largest owner of TV transmitters and food producer Bakkavor have pulled their stock market listings because of market uncertainty. Arqiva has postponed a stock market flotation  that would have valued the group at £6bn. Bakkavor, which supplies food to M&S and Waitrose, has scrapped its plan that potentially valued it at £1bn. Both firms announced their listing plans last month, but  cited market volatility for their change of heart. In October, a number of European companies floated but saw their shares perform weakly in the following days. French fashion group SMCP shares have barely risen above their initial stock market flotation price of €21 (£19; $24) each.  Austrian bank Bawag listed at €48 a share and is now trading at €45.76 while Spanish housebuilder Aedas Homes floated at €31.65 and its shares are now worth €31.00. Arqiva, which is owned by the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Australian bank Macquarie, may proceed with a float next year if market conditions improve. Its clients include the BBC, ITV and international broadcasters and its masts cover about 98% of the UK. However, Bakkavor, the UK's largest supplier of hummus, said it will no longer proceed with its plans for an initial public offering (IPO). It said: ""Whilst the company received sufficient institutional demand to cover the offering, the board has taken the decision that proceeding with the transaction would not be in the best interests of the company, or its shareholders, given the current volatility in the IPO market."" Neil Glover, business development director for the UK and Ireland at EY, said that recently there has been a ""real lack of traditional IPOs"" which he described as companies with household or more easily recognisable names. He said: ""We believe in 2018, there will be a minor build-up of IPOs in the second and third quarter,"" adding that ""some investors are keeping their powder dry"" until then. Mr Glover also said that that companies are eager to announce their flotations before 2019: ""Everyone is a bit paranoid about Brexit and they want to move before it takes place."" Bakkavor, which operates across the UK, China and the US and employs around 18,500 people, was founded in 1986 by Icelandic brothers Lydur and Agust Gudmundsson. Mr Gudmundsson is the chief executive of the group which in 2016 reported a 3.6% rise in group sales to £1.7bn. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (ebitda) increased by 12.3% to £145.6m."
Volatility,Holidaymakers hit as pound slides,2024-09-25,2019-05-21,By Kevin Peachey,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48348607,"The pound has fallen to its lowest level for five months just as many UK holidaymakers get ready to head off for the late-May half-term break. Against the US dollar, the pound fell below $1.27 for the first time since January on Tuesday. It also fell early in the day against the euro. But it picked up again later in the day in a sign of its current volatility. Cabinet backing for Prime Minister Theresa May's latest Brexit plan led to the rebound. Currency experts say Brexit uncertainty and the US-China trade war have both contributed to the pound's recent fall. Sterling had gained some ground in recent months, but in recent days rates have fallen back to the kind of levels seen during the Christmas holidays. It is a very different picture from March 2008, when the pound was briefly worth more than $2. Holidaymakers heading off for an early summer break in Europe or the US may be saving money by avoiding the even higher costs of travelling in July and August. However, they are finding that their money will not go as far as it did a few years ago. Anyone leaving it to the last minute and changing money at the airport will always get the worst rates. At some airports, they will find an exchange rate little better than parity between the pound and the euro. James Hickman, chief commercial officer at currency traders FairFx, said that the best rates were given to those who ordered their holiday money ahead. He suggested that would also be a good plan for anyone thinking about their holiday money for later this summer. At present, the best rates on pre-loaded currency cards sees a pound buy just over $1.27 and just over €1.13. For those collecting from an exchange bureau, the best deals will see the pound get slightly less than $1.26 and just under €1.13. The Post Office - the most popular bureau for UK holidaymakers - sees anyone changing more than £400 receiving slightly over $1.24 and just over €1.11 for their pound. The recent drop in the value of the pound has come amid speculation over the future of Brexit. ""When sentiment moves towards a higher likelihood of a hard Brexit, then we see a fall in the pound,"" Mr Hickman said. The reverse is also true, shown by the rebound after the cabinet gave its backing to Mrs May's plan for her Withdrawal Agreement Bill, including compromises intended to attract the support of Labour MPs. Sterling is also affected indirectly by the continuing trade war between the US and China. Hamish Muress, currency analyst at OFX, said the pound was ""suffering from the renewed uncertainty of Brexit, while investors flood to the relatively safer US dollar amidst the ongoing trade war"".  ""Looking forward, headwinds look stronger than tailwinds for the pound, particularly with another Brexit vote not set to take place for a few weeks yet. But perhaps the only real hope would come from Donald Trump pressing the pause button with regards to the trade war,"" he added. Alana Parsons, from foreign exchange firm Caxton, said: ""Getting the most value for your travel money can be tricky, but not if we spend as much time planning our finances as we do researching our holiday destinations."""
Volatility,Crypto regulation may drive growth in poorer areas,2024-09-25,2022-05-01,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-bristol-61156439,"The south west is ""perfectly positioned"" to benefit from plans to regulate cryptocurrency, an expert has claimed. Chancellor Rishi Sunak recently announced his intention to make the UK a ""global hub"" for crypto. The move could spread wealth to areas - like parts of the south west - that have lacked investment, crypto entrepreneur Herbert Sim has said. Academic Chris Carr said he was ""doubtful"" this would happen. He explained that while ""some people have managed to get wealthy, there is still a concern that this will benefit the rich, who can afford to take risks and invest early"". Despite this, he said the emerging industry - which has been likened to a virtual form of cash - could create platforms ""that aim to distribute wealth more evenly"".  ""There are certainly people out there who have this aim in mind."" Crypto expert Mr Sim - who has even trademarked the name ""Bitcoin Man"" - is more optimistic and believes Mr Sunak's plans could ""reverse these fortunes"" in areas which have historically lacked investment. Attracting more of the £1.64 trillion global industry to areas like Swindon, Cheltenham and Gloucester would provide a welcome boost by creating highly-skilled and paid jobs like blockchain engineers and cryptocurrency developers, he said. He added: ""The UK and the south west is perfectly positioned to capitalise on the growth of crypto. ""Crypto is only going one direction - and that is firmly towards growth. There is no shortage of demand so the only question that matters is where it is going to set up base. ""With China's crackdown on Bitcoin and the crypto mines (which use vast quantities of power to create new blockchain through vast computer networks), we already see the shift of Bitcoins from China to the USA and Canada. ""Developing nations such as El Salvador and India are racing towards embracing Bitcoin, and leap-frogging  past first world countries. ""That all requires a highly-skilled and tech-savvy workforce. With all the universities and existing tech companies in UK and the south west it is ideally suited to capitalise on that opportunity."" Both men spoke after recent figures from the Office for National Statistics revealed that the region has the joint slowest growing research and development (R&D) workforce in the country. Investment in the sector is a key driver of growth and seen as vital to improving living standards in the current cost of living crisis. Figures from the ONS revealed that the number of R&D jobs in the south west has climbed just 43.8% over the past decade - less than a fifth of London's figure. The region's M4 corridor has had some success in attracting tech companies including Dyson, Just Eat and Huawei. But they have not delivered the number of highly-skilled and paid jobs to push the area up the list and is currently sits joint-bottom. Crypto is also increasingly used in ""play-to-earn"" games that are built on blockchain technology. Mr Sim - who has himself invested in play-to-earn game ETHEKing.io - says it has sparked a ""paradigm shift, which will revolutionise the gaming industry"". He believes this gaming mechanism is ""only going to explode and grow exponentially, with more and more brands jumping on the bandwagon, as the investors and gamers flood in."" University of the West of England (UWE) lecturer Xiaojun Luo agrees that crypto could ""further stimulate"" the area's economy. She thinks that ""appropriate regulations are needed to reduce the volatility of cryptocurrencies, protect consumers from illicit activities"" and generate a new source of government revenues. Dr Luo explained that ""adopting suitable regulations"" makes the market more liquid and would ""further enhance the ability of participants to buy and sell crypto assets"".  ""The higher transaction rate of crypto assets can further stimulate the south west economy."" Currently the University of Bristol and UWE both offer degrees in Fintech so have students familiar with the sector, blockchain programming and international banking and finance law. But Dr Carr - a lecturer at the University of Exeter - is not convinced that any of this would help spread wealth despite some crypto-proponents wishing to do so. He said that while remote working could benefit the south west, the ""knock on effect"" could be that the jobs are outsourced abroad. He added: ""I am doubtful on the wealth spreading, though I sincerely hope so. ""Regulation may help, but at the moment the crypto markets are heavily influenced by 'whales' who have enough money to effectively pump and dump any coin.  ""There is still plenty of things like that going on."" He urged universities in the area to create developers and coders by running courses which ""teach people how to build these technologies themselves, even if that is not their intended career path"". However the problem is that universities ""can't or don't want to"" compete financially with what top quality blockchain creators can earn in the commercial world.

Volatility,Fears over risk-taking by cryptoasset investors,2024-09-25,2021-06-17,By Kevin Peachey,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-57509974,"More people are investing in so-called cryptoassets and they are less likely to think they are taking a gamble, the City regulator suggests. The research has prompted a fresh warning from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) that crypto investors risk losing the lot. Some 14% of crypto buyers who were surveyed also said they had borrowed to invest, buoyed by reports of big gains. One analyst described that statistic as ""simply terrifying"". The FCA estimated that 2.3 million adults in the UK now held cryptoassets - the most common of which is cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin. The eye-catching swings in price of these products have drawn in scores of investors, and led to a swathe of marketing. The regulator also noted that whereas nearly half of investors (47%) last year considered their stake in cryptoassets as a gamble, that proportion had now dropped to 38%. Just over half of those who have invested already were considering buying more, the research found. The FCA warned that any problems with these investments were not covered by the usual safety nets as they were unregulated assets. ""If consumers invest in these types of products, they should be prepared to lose all their money,"" said Sheldon Mills, from the FCA. Unlike with regulated investments, buyers would not get support from the Financial Ombudsman Service or the Financial Services Compensation Scheme if they were mis-sold crypto or the provider went bust. Laith Khalaf, financial analyst at AJ Bell, said: ""There is a dark underbelly lurking in the figures, which suggests there is still potential for widespread consumer harm.  ""The fact that 14% of crypto buyers have borrowed to invest is simply terrifying. The extreme volatility and uncertain long-term outlook for crypto means holdings can be wiped out, leaving borrowers with nothing but their debt as a memento."""

Volatility,The Canadian neighbourhood heated by sewage,2024-09-25,2024-01-03,Anna Turns,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20240103-sewage-a-low-cost-low-carbon-way-to-warm-homes,"In this part of Vancouver, innovative technology is harnessing heat from wastewater and using it as a renewable energy source to heat homes. When the occasional snowfall dusts the streets of Vancouver in the midst of winter, the layer of white can quickly become punctuated by steaming openings where it has already melted. The access holes to the drains below ground are caused by the heat flowing through the city's sewers, warming up the pavements.  ""There's enough heat in the sewerage system to literally heat up neighbourhoods,"" remarks Derek Pope, manager of neighbourhood energy for the city of Vancouver, Canada. ""That's what we've been doing here in False Creek since 2010."" The residents of False Creek, a recently redeveloped neighbourhood of Vancouver, on the west coast of Canada, get their energy from a rather unusual renewable source – their sewage wastewater. Increasingly, municipalities around the globe are harnessing this underground form of excess heat as they decarbonise their energy networks. Residents in the 6,210 apartments in the False Creek neighbourhood get their heat from renewable energy sources, with sewage heat being the largest contributor.

This email is currently available to non-UK readers. In the UK? Sign up for newsletters here. Everything that goes down our drains ends up as sewage water – from what we flush down the toilet, to what comes out of our baths and washing machines.  Down the pipe it flows, eventually ending up in a wastewater treatment plant where it is chemically, biologically and mechanically cleaned and treated, ready to be recirculated back into our homes once again. But the heat that's generated from the dishwasher or a long, hot shower is generally forgotten about once it washes down the plughole, explains Pope. Instead it heads underground, and straight into the sewer systems – escaping out of vents and melting through winter snow. Heat in water is relatively easy to harness once it's in the sewage system because it's contained – and no, any heat recovered isn't going to smell. By comparison, heat in the air quickly escapes out of windows, doors, and roofs. In addition, there's plenty of hot wastewater to work with. In 2020, experts at the London South Bank University estimated that energy from the UK's daily 16 billion litres of sewage wastewater could, in theory, provide more than 20TWh of heat energy annually – enough to provide space heating and hot water to 1.6 million homes. Over in the US, Americans flush an estimated 350TWh of energy down the drain each year – the equivalent of heating 30 million homes a year.  Tucked under a Vancouver bridge, an energy centre sits on top of the existing sewage pumping station so heat can be captured before sewage reaches the treatment plant. Heat pumps cool down warm sewage that's around 20C (68F) in temperature and concentrate that heat to produce scalding hot water which can be as high as 80C (176F), Pope explains. ""What's really exciting is that our heat recovery system operates at efficiencies of over 300%, so for every unit of electricity that we put in to run the heat pump, we get over three units of thermal energy or heat out of it."" Sewage is also consistently warm so heat pumps continue to operate efficiently even on cold wintry days when heat demand is highest – providing a constant source of renewable energy. In the EU, buildings are responsible for 40% of energy consumption. Heating, cooling and domestic hot water account for 80% of the energy that we, as citizens, consume. In Vancouver, Pope explains, buildings are responsible for more than 50% of the city's greenhouse gas emissions, because the main way the city heats its buildings and produces hot water is by combusting natural gas. ""So utilising waste heat is one of the tools in our toolbelt to transition away from that,"" he says. ""This is a really good platform for reducing emissions at the neighbourhood scale, especially in areas in dense populations."" Harnessing sewage heat is a ""missed opportunity"", according to Semida Silveira, professor in systems engineering at Cornell University in the US. ""There's a lot of heat in the world that we just throw away. Today, we have a lot of energy inefficiency,"" Silveira explains, pointing out that energy efficiency could resolve half of the targets for carbon reductions in the US. Energy efficiency is overlooked because it's invisible, Silveira adds. Yet, the International Energy Agency, the global authority for the energy sector, refers to energy efficiency as ""the first fuel"" – a simple and cost-effective way to reduce demand and strengthen energy security. Excess heat is the world's largest untapped energy source according to a 2023 report published by global engineering firm Danfoss. The report highlights how surplus heat produced in the EU – the heat released from transport networks, factories, data centres, sewage systems and so on – could provide heat for almost the entire region if harnessed effectively. Excess heat within the sewage system is being successfully captured and repurposed in some towns and communities, like False Creek. Once the heat running through False Creek's sewage pipes is recovered by heat pumps a five-mile-long (8.3km) pipe network, known as a thermal grid, distributes heat back to the district's 44 buildings. ""In each building, heat exchangers transfer heat out from the closed-loop water system into the buildings' heat system and domestic hot water pipes, then cool water recirculates back to the energy plant,"" Pope explains. At False Creek's sewage heat recovery system, construction is underway to expand. Heat pump capacity is being tripled from 3 megawatts (MW) to more than 9MW. ""That's a big milestone for the utility,"" says Pope who has noticed ""an explosion"" of district energy systems across the Greater Vancouver region, with many using or planning to use sewage heat as their primary source of energy, as opposed to fossil fuels such as natural gas. As part of Vancouver's climate emergency action plan, the False Creek Neighbourhood Energy Utility, which is owned and operated by the city, is developing a roadmap for heat sources to be fully renewable by 2030. By then, Pope envisages most systems will use a combination of waste heat, thermal storage, and other renewables to meet decarbonisation targets. The biggest challenge is a lack of integrated, forward-thinking urban planning, argues Pope: ""We need to start viewing waste heat as a resource and find ways to incorporate that into our city planning."" While he acknowledges there's some upfront capital cost, Pope explains the neighbourhood energy unit in False Creek is set to recover its outgoings; residents pay utility rates and the cost of low-carbon energy is relatively low, plus the recent expansion has been part-funded by a grant that supports projects reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Next, he wants to see more municipal governments make that step to implementation. You might also like: Investing in infrastructure that uses this form of excess heat as a resource makes financial sense because wastewater treatment is such an energy-intensive process. Water treatment plants eat up an estimated 30-40% of municipal electricity bills, according to a 2017 report by the Congressional Research Service, a US-based public policy research institute. By harnessing sewage heat, wastewater treatment plants could become energy producers rather than energy consumers. In the Danish city of Aarhus, the Marselisborg wastewater treatment plant produces more energy than it needs to treat and distribute water for the 200,000 people it services, by recovering waste heat and processing waste sludge to produce biogas. The potential in excess heat from wastewater treatment plants in Denmark, a country of 5.8 million inhabitants, corresponds to 600-700MW, according to the Danish Water and Wastewater Association. That's the equivalent of two fairly large power plants, meaning a potential to heat about 20% of all households with carbon-neutral heat sourced from sewage. Change, Silveira believes, is on the horizon. ""Urban planners always used to think about land use, transport, functionalities, but today many municipalities are thinking in terms of energy too,"" she says. But well-designed policy is crucial. Silveira says the key question for municipalities is whether to capture heat from sewage water at a local level (by capturing hot shower water in buildings, for example) or at a more centralised level (once sewage water reaches the treatment plant). While property owners might want to recapture excess heat within the buildings directly to reduce their energy bills, water treatment plants might prefer more heat to reach them via warm sewage so they don't have to buy-in extra heat. The technology exists for homeowners to capture excess heat – for example, the steam from a hot shower – which can be funnelled back into the home's own heating system. However, it's costly. ""If you're going to solve the problem, you're going to have to make an investment, so the question is, who's going to pay for that?"" Silveira asks. In Sweden, a cold country with high heat demands, district heating systems like False Creek's are commonplace. In densely populated areas, they are ""a fantastic way to distribute waste heat"" from a variety of sources, including sewage, says Silveira, who has been studying the wastewater heat recovery system in Stockholm that provides heat to about 800,000 residents. ""The Stockholm system is totally underground, you don't see or hear anything, there's no smell,"" she explains. Like in Aarhus, Stockholm's sewage heat recovery produces biogas from digested sludge. That biogas is used as bus fuel by the city's public transport network. ""You can do a lot to improve the circularity of a city if you have these centralised solutions,"" says Silveira who emphasises that Sweden's pioneering carbon tax system has also been ""instrumental"" because it provided the incentive for the heating sector to use waste heat and move away from fossil fuels. Carbon count The travel emissions it took to report this story were 0kg CO2. The digital emissions from this story are an estimated 1.2g to 3.6g CO2 per page view. Find out more about how we calculated this figure here. So successful harnessing of surplus heat from sewage is not just about technology, as Silveira explains. There has to be buy-in at government-level. ""Political organisation and regulations influence which direction the decision makers choose to go, and political will depends on what they perceive as possible."" She explains that in Sweden, centralised solutions like district heating have worked well because municipalities have the power to make these kinds of long-term decisions. But even in countries like the UK where local councils don't have as much sway, or where urban areas aren't yet set up for district heating, sewage heat can still be repurposed and used to operate water treatment plants and provide clean water and sanitation. ""If water treatment plants can use that energy internally, that's a big thing that most cities can do,"" says Silveira. Already, wastewater heat recovery projects are underway around the world, including in London's Kingston-upon-Thames, Oslo in Norway and Beijing, China. Back in False Creek, there are tangible benefits for residents. Noisy heat pumps and boiler equipment operate within the energy centre, so rooftops of residential buildings that would otherwise have been home to heating infrastructure are being repurposed as communal gardens and green roofs. Maintenance is centralised, carried out by professionals and paid for by the neighbourhood energy unit – plus customers are protected from fuel price volatility, Pope says. ""By connecting to a system that operates at a very high efficiency, you're sheltered from price swings in gas or electricity."" Pope hopes that False Creek will inspire other municipalities to decarbonise their thermal grids. ""The local emission reductions that we're realising are great but where we can really amplify the effect of what the city is doing is by sharing what's worked and what hasn't, then help others make confident investments in low carbon energy."" -- Correction: This story originally stated that False Creek was a suburb of Vancouver, which is incorrect.

Volatility,The underrated genius of Bowie's acting,2024-09-25,2022-01-06,Rachel Pronger,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20220105-the-underrated-genius-of-david-bowies-acting,"As we approach the 75th anniversary of Bowie's birth, we explore his unpredictable film roles. Every part he played was 'in conversation with his many alter egos', argues Rachel Pronger. One of the many pioneering elements of David Bowie's career was his commitment to the visual. For Bowie, sound and vision went hand in hand. His many star personas – Ziggy Stardust, Aladdin Sane, Major Tom – each came with their own fully realised aesthetic worlds, costumes, make-up and artwork that were as instantly recognisable as the music itself. Long before the advent of MTV, Bowie was making short films to promote his music, and he would go on to push the boundaries of the form with iconic videos such as Ashes to Ashes. Indeed, Bowie's final gift to the world came in filmic form – the video for his last single Lazarus was released on 7 January 2016, just three days before his death. More like this: -          The cult 90s film that blazed a trail -          Stories that reflect our oldest fear -          The photos that made Bowie an icon It's unsurprising that this most mercurial of artists, with his visual sensibility and many alter-egos, would be drawn to film. Yet, while Bowie's legendary status in music is beyond question, quantifying his contribution to cinema as an actor is more complicated. In the three decades between The Man Who Fell to Earth (1976) and The Prestige (2006), Bowie appeared in dozens of films but – despite that span of credits – only a few of these roles came close to making the most of his talent. When we leave aside the many cameos – of which the uncontested crème de le crème is Bowie solemnly adjudicating a runway walk-off in Zoolander – and the forgettable flops – the less said about Just a Gigolo, the better – we are left with only a handful of performances. Yet those acting roles that did manage to effectively exploit Bowie's gifts are easily enough to secure his status as a cinema icon. When matched with an inventive director, Bowie could be an unforgettable screen presence.   From the start of his career, Bowie was an artist who often turned to cinema for inspiration. Whether referencing Stanley Kubrick on Space Oddity, posing like Greta Garbo on the cover of Hunky Dory or channelling German expressionism as the Thin White Duke, Bowie was constantly drawing on film iconography in his music. Filmmakers quickly identified his potential as a subject, with documentaries such as DA Pennebaker's Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1979) and Alan Yentob's Cracked Actor (1975) capturing spectacular live performances and intimate behind-the-scenes footage. Cracked Actor depicts Bowie at the height of his 1970s fame, rattled by cocaine, and driven to the brink of sanity by the pressures of stardom. It was this image of a strung-out Bowie driving around LA in the back of a limousine that inspired Nicolas Roeg to cast the musician in his first major film role. The Man Who Fell to Earth is the story of Thomas Newton, an alien on a rescue mission from his home planet who crash-lands on Earth and ends up stranded in the New Mexico desert. Disguised as a human, Newton attempts to raise money for a new spaceship by selling alien technologies but soon becomes corrupted by human vices.   By 1975, Roeg had already established his reputation with arthouse landmarks such as Walkabout and Don't Look Now. The Man Who Fell to Earth brought together one of the most interesting directors of the 1970s with the decade's defining popstar, and the result is a trippy triumph. Like Bowie's music, the film mashes up genres – sci-fi, political thriller, romance – and channels the counter-cultural mood of the time to create something bracingly new. With a fragmented, often confusing narrative, it's a genuinely risky film that feels as if it could crash land at any moment, but which is held together by a magnetic central performance. Without Bowie, The Man Who Fell to Earth would be an intriguing curio; with him, it becomes a classic.   Part of Bowie's power lies in his astonishing physical presence. Pale and emaciated, with streaks of red hair falling into mismatched eyes, Bowie requires little make-up to convince as an alien in disguise. A series of retro costumes – wide fedoras, loose high-waisted trousers, tight white T-shirts – draw out his androgynous beauty and emphasise Newton's genderless nature. That blurring of gender boundaries is reflected too in Bowie's frail physicality and delicate movements. Bowie's Newton moves initially with the faltering steps of someone learning to walk again. When he collapses in a hotel lift, chambermaid and future lover Cindy Lou (Candy Clarke) scoops him into her arms, and carries him to bed as if he weighs nothing at all. But there is more to this performance than a dazzling surface. In the throes of his addiction, Bowie was in a fragile mental state during the shoot, and his sense of dissociation is perhaps part of what makes him so frighteningly credible as a stranded alien. At times, as Bowie oscillates between sweet helplessness and terrifying volatility, it feels more like a possession than a performance. Scenes in which Newton succumbs to addiction, sitting before a wall of wailing televisions or stirring his drinks with a gun, crackle with manic energy. The final image of Newton slumped in his seat, just another drunk with nowhere to go, is devastating. By casting Bowie, Roeg encourages us to blur the boundaries between character and performer, and in doing so draws out new layers of meaning. Newton, adrift in cowboy country with a London accent and British papers, is an alien in several senses. It's possible to read the film as a straight sci-fi, but also as a metaphor for the outsider status of the immigrant, for the loneliness of genius or for the isolation of celebrity. Much of Bowie's art feels like it comes from another planet but, as his tender performance demonstrates, to be exceptional can be alienating.   In The Man Who Fell to Earth, Roeg set the template that would define Bowie's film career. All of his most successful screen performances share certain hallmarks – an unusually imaginative director, a role as an exceptional outsider, a blurring between star persona and character. Music critics tend to praise Bowie's chameleonic quality, his ability to switch from extra-terrestrial rock to blue-eyed soul to polished pop in the blink of an eye. Yet as an actor, Bowie was no chameleon – instead of disappearing into his roles, he floated above them, always a level removed. This distance meant that every part Bowie played was inevitably in conversation with his many alter egos, and with the nature of fame itself. Reality and performance Bowie's most effective performances tap into that meta-commentary. An example of this is his brief but memorable appearance as Andy Warhol in Julian Schnabel's biopic Basquiat (1996). Based on Schnabel's friendship with the artist Jean-Michel Basquiat, the film is full of characters modelled on real people from the 1980s New York art scene. In real life, Warhol was a hero of Bowie's – there's a song dedicated to him on Hunky Dory – and the two had crossed paths at parties. By casting Bowie, Schnabel has one legendary artist disguise themselves as another, and in doing so taps into the same ideas about fame that defined Warhol's art. Bowie delivers a delightfully ironic turn, peering out from beneath a silver shock wig (taken from Warhol's real-life wig collection), his lip curled in constant amusement. In a film that sometimes takes itself too seriously, Bowie delivers a dose of wry camp, playfully exposing the shallow nature of artworld celebrity and once again blurring the boundaries between reality and performance. On a similar wavelength, but even better, is Bowie's supporting role as the inventor Nikola Tesla in Christopher Nolan's tricksy period thriller The Prestige (2006). Tesla was another famous maverick, a Serbian-born pioneer of electronic engineering who died in 1943 after a troubled but influential life. In Bowie's interpretation, Tesla becomes a kind of real-life twin to Thomas Newton, a displaced genius who teases the boundary between magic and science – and is ultimately destroyed by the greed of those who surround him. Like Newton, Bowie's Tesla arrives with a bang, appearing apparently from nowhere in a cloud of sparks. Bowie's occasionally extravagant performance – all lustrous moustache and lilting, indeterminate accent – is tempered by a core of vulnerability that grounds this archetypal mad scientist in poignant reality. The same otherworldly quality that makes Bowie's takes on Warhol and Tesla so successful, is also used to beguiling effect in two 1980s cult classics. Jim Henson's fantasy Labyrinth (1986) was a commercial disappointment on first release but has since become a cult favourite. Bowie's justifiably much-loved performance as the Goblin King is key to the film's appeal. Resplendent in bejewelled blouses, outrageously tight trousers and a shocking wig that tops even Warhol's, Bowie relishes the opportunity to play the villain. On his own terms, Henson was himself something of a genius, and like Roeg he delivers a series of memorable images that capitalise on his star's incandescent charisma. Bowie's Jareth fizzes with mischievous magic, as he materialises like a shimmering apparition in an open window or strides upside-down across rotating Escher-indebted stairways. Tony Scott's uneven The Hunger (1983) is less satisfying overall but does offer the tantalising prospect of Bowie as one half of a stylish vampire couple alongside Catherine Deneuve. The Hunger came out immediately after the release of Bowie's phenomenally successful Let’s Dance album, and the role offers a goth twist on his slickly handsome 80s pop persona. Bowie's creature of the night is exquisitely stylish and devastatingly sexy, prowling blue-lit Manhattan nightclubs in sunglasses searching for his next fix. The film is worth watching for Bowie's elegantly unhinged performance and for its moments of delirious excess, such as an exhilarating opening sequence in which Bowie and Deneuve procure a couple of hipsters for dinner to an unsettling Bauhaus soundtrack. In the same year that Bowie went full goth in The Hunger, he also delivered one of his most substantial and grounded performances. In Nagisa Ōshima's Merry Christmas, Mr Lawrence (1983), Bowie stars as Major Celliers, a soldier serving in Java during World War Two, who is captured and sent to a brutal Japanese prison camp. In confinement, Celliers becomes a leadership figure for his fellow prisoners and an object of obsession for the camp's commander Captain Yonoi (Ryuichi Sakamoto). In many ways, this is Bowie's straightest performance. Tanned and movie-star handsome, aside from his endearingly crooked British teeth, Bowie's Celliers initially embodies dignified masculine power. Yet, as is always the case with his best performances, Bowie brings to the surface a subversive subtext, drawing out the queerness that lies beneath many war-movie tropes. As the film progresses, Celliers infuriates his captors with increasingly transgressive acts of rebellion, showing his contempt for authority through flamboyant performances, singing songs, collecting flowers and even by kissing Yonoi. By casting Bowie alongside fellow musician Sakamoto (a legendary popstar in his own right), Ōshima presents us with a face-off between two titans of 20th-Century music. The homoerotic tension between the pair culminates in an ambiguous moment when, having sentenced Celliers to be buried alive, Yanoi visits the condemned man to cut a lock of his hair, like a fan or a lover would. The film's climactic image of Celliers buried neck-deep in the sand, his hair bleached by the blazing sun, is an arresting tableau fit for an album cover. In the aftermath of the star's death, such indelible images have gained new significance. Bowie's death robbed us of future music, but it also took away the possibility of more film roles, of more opportunities for this most unusual of artists to enchant and surprise us at the cinema. Not all of Bowie's roles were worthy of his talent, but those that were have at least left us with some kind of compensation. The Starman may be gone, but some element of his extraordinary charisma will always remain, a glittering after-image burned forever on to the silver screen.   Bowie: Starman and the Silver Screen is at BFI Southbank, London, until the end of January, with select films available to stream on BFI Player.

Volatility,The couples the world is obsessed by,2024-09-25,2021-06-22,Christina Newland,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20210621-what-makes-the-ultimate-hollywood-power-couple,"The apparent reunion of Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez has prompted mass jubilation. They are in a lineage of star romances that the world has fallen for, writes Christina Newland. Last week, a photo of Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck kissing at a Malibu restaurant apparently confirmed what many had suspected: that the pair are once again romantically involved, 17 years after they split up. Since speculation began about the couple being reunited over a month ago, after the both newly-single stars were spotted hanging out, delirious joy has seemed to spread like wildfire over social media. Maybe, for a generation of millennials, this jubilation is down to nostalgia, the news a reminder of their days idly flicking through gossip magazines back in an era when they had the time and inclination to peruse the glossy pages. Maybe – after years watching both stars deal with the vagaries of public life, complete with hit roles, Oscar wins, back tattoos, and a string of high-profile relationships for them both – it's heartwarming to see that love can somehow find a way. Especially the kind of only-in-Hollywood love that inspires a man to kiss his girlfriend's bottom for all the world to see, as Affleck did in Lopez's music video for 2002 single Jenny from the Block. More like this: –      Is the age of the celebrity over? –      Hollywood heartthrobs through the ages –      10 films to watch in June From the moment they started dating that same year, the pair were a designated Hollywood power couple, with Affleck's down-to-earth Boston guy persona and Lopez's super-glam style proving a heady contrast, as they graced countless red carpets. They became affectionately nicknamed 'Bennifer', and the press's love affair with the pair of them was seemingly never-ending, even in the face of Gigli (2003), their flop-of-all-flops romantic comedy which is often called one of the worst movies of all time. Then, in 2004, the pair broke up only a few days before a planned wedding date, and within a year both would be married to other people. (Affleck to the actress Jennifer Garner, and Lopez to singer Marc Anthony).  Now, come 2021, their relationship is once again being pored over and revelled in, only through new more democratic, social media channels: recently, a snap of a smirking Ben Affleck leaving Lopez's home in the morning was immediately transformed into a meme. So, what is it about Bennifer’s reunion that seems to have sparked such remarkable fanfare among the general public? The reasons for people's fascination It's a complex question with more than one answer. Partly, such a response is not unique to Lopez and Affleck; celebrity power couples have fascinated us for a long time. From Beyonce and Jay-Z to Kim and Kanye (who recently divorced) to Brad and Angelina (who divorced in 2016), the combined glamour of two A-listers can seem twice as arresting. The latter, like Lopez and Affleck, are specifically a Hollywood power couple, adding another layer of intrigue for an audience who can follow them not just in press coverage but also through their appearances in movies together. With Lopez and Affleck, their screen pairings (so far at least) have never been what we'd call a success; but think of the onscreen rapport over the years between real-life couple Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy, whose fast-paced squabbling and opposites-attract humour took them through classic screwball romances like Woman of the Year (1942) and Adam's Rib (1949). Their screen chemistry made them all the more lovable in the public's eyes. Such was the case, too, with Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor, who would star in 11 films together over the 60s and 70s. This run began with Cleopatra (1963), on the set of which the two met, but the combination of sexual heat and emotional volatility they were known for in real life is maybe best translated to screen in the vicious marriage drama Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (1966). It's not always a necessity that Hollywood power couples have potent screen chemistry, but it certainly helps the public imagination when they do. It may also be that our fascination with specific Hollywood power couples comes down to our individual preconceptions about what fame, celebrity, or heterosexual romance should look like. If you were asked to choose a 'favourite' Hollywood power couple, the answer may reveal more than you think about your romantic ideals, your ideal self, and what you might identify with in the story that this famous couple is telling the world. The Hollywood power couple is the forging of two distinct star personas, styles and personal baggage into one amorphous media construct – so amorphous that even their names become blended into something goofy-sounding. Some, like Brangelina, consist of two people both too attractive to seem real, and the combined force of their sexual chemistry (as displayed in 2005's Mr and Mrs Smith) is gobsmacking. The best ones have yin-and-yang, complementary qualities: Lauren Bacall gave Humphrey Bogart youthful zip and sensuality, all velvety smoothness to his jagged demeanour. Taylor was queenly enough to suit a Shakespearean actor like Burton, but the upper-class beauty was brought up a world away from the Welshman's more humble origins. Although affairs, romances, flings, and marriages happen in Hollywood as they do everywhere else, the concept of the power couple was a creation first and foremost by the studio-era publicity machine. That machine operated as an extension of each studio's interests and was fiercely protective of its contracted actors' reputations and images. In the 20th Century, that also meant that heterosexuality was compulsory, and even until fairly recently, that's remained mostly the case. In the case of LGBTQ+ actors, studio publicists of Golden-Age Hollywood were never beyond concocting romantic rumours for fan magazines or even sending stars out on fabricated dates to throw gossip columnists off the trail. Rock Hudson, Montgomery Clift, and other ""confirmed bachelors"", as the coded lingo went, were often set up with starlets for the paparazzi at premieres. As such, queer couples have largely been erased from the 'power couple' equation until, for the most part, the last two decades. Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi had an extravagant wedding in 2008, covered by all the major entertainment news outlets in the way any lavish celeb wedding might be. This year, Jodie Foster and her wife Alexandra Hedison made headlines when Foster accepted her Golden Globe via Zoom with the pair and their dog all in adorable matching pyjamas. But the wider exclusion of queer people from this form of imagery is in itself pretty telling: in the eyes of the media, extravagant coupledom seems to still be reserved for straight people.   The history of the Hollywood power couple The first Hollywood power couple in history was one many might not know of today: Mary Pickford, the silent film actress known as America's Sweetheart, and Douglas Fairbanks, the swashbuckling actor who played the first Robin Hood. The couple's palatial Beverley Hills home, set on 18 acres and featuring everything from a zoo to an old-west style saloon, boasted visitors like F Scott Fitzgerald and Charlie Chaplin in the 1920s. But it's something else about the house that’s really striking: decades before ""Bennifer"" hit the press, the house was nicknamed ""Pickfair"", a combination of the names Pickford and Fairbanks. Every move of the husband and wife was followed by the nation's press, still wide-eyed with the relatively new concept of movie stardom. Of course, we've had a wide variety of Hollywood power couples since then. Eccentric habits, tumultuous affairs, or ridiculous mansions never exactly hurt their status in the press: it's all grist for the mill, a part of the narrative of their coupledom. Crucially, it takes more than just two famous people to make one of these pairings. Both must be genuine stars, who are at once each renowned enough on their own merit and on something like equal standing in their fame. In the 40s and 50s, there was Ava Gardner, the sultry pin-up, and Frank Sinatra, the crooner that she ""stole"" from his nice Italian wife Nancy, as the media saw it. The Gardner-Sinatra affair and remarriage caused a scandal, but the pair would forever be associated with a certain brand of mid-century glamour. Today, there's Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith, who have grown mature and had children in front of our collective eyes; when Jada publicly admitted she had been unfaithful in a conversation with her husband on an episode of her show Red Table Talk, the discomfort in the audience was palpable. But the pair seem to have weathered it, joking with each other on the same episode, in a knowing reference to a catchphrase from Will's Bad Boys franchise: ""bad marriage for life!""   Then there were shorter-lived pairings that still burn bright in the cultural imagination: Anjelica Huston and Jack Nicholson were the cool kids of cinematic rebellion in the 70s, while the nattily attired Elliott Gould and Barbra Streisand, two of Hollywood's most prominent Jewish stars, also ruled the decade. Those were the sorts of couples whose dinner parties you'd love to be invited to. Taylor and Burton were so madly in love and yet so stormy that they divorced and then remarried again only 16 months later – only to divorce for the second time eight months later. Taylor had a total of seven husbands (eight if you count Burton twice). Some of them were pretty famous in their day, including actor Eddie Fisher. And yet no one seemed to meet the stature of Burton in her eyes, from the beginning of their torrid affair during the making of 1963's Cleopatra, when each was still married, to Fisher and actress Sybil Williams, respectively. Their amour fou and their lavish lifestyles were catnip for the public. As Burton had it, ""Our love is so furious we burn each other out"". Or maybe you prefer the steadiness of the adorable Goldie Hawn and the forever-hunky Kurt Russell, who have been together for nearly 40 years and still seem like teenage sweethearts. In the end, the public interest in the Hollywood power couple – as well as the question of what makes some more powerful than others – comes down to many things. Maybe it's some pre-conditioned social urge to see other humans romantically paired-off into cute little units, or stems from some prurient sexual desire for one or both people. Maybe – OK, definitely – we're just nosy. From Confidential Magazine, the audacious scandal mag that was taken to court in 1957 for its rumours about everyone from Grace Kelly to Robert Mitchum, to today's Instagram gossip source Deuxmoi, which publishes blind items from anonymous sources directly to its near one million followers, gossip is certainly not a new phenomenon. The public can't help themselves, even while knowing it's all a little vulgar and a little scurrilous. When it comes to the Hollywood power couple, even the break-up or divorce provides something to the audience. In the press and among its consumers, there is simultaneous sadness and schadenfreude: see, people crow, they aren't perfect after all. What's heartening about the reaction to the Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck reunion is that it's born, perhaps, of an inverse collective impulse: a determined, idealistic faith in the prospect of enduring love, even when it seems profoundly unlikely after so many years of two people being apart. Bennifer has set the whole world talking not because of who they are, but because of who we are. For many millennials, certainly, they make us feel as young and as hopeful as we were in 2002.

Volatility,Why the world feels so uncertain,2024-09-25,2023-02-06,Tim Palmer,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20230203-why-the-world-feels-so-unstable-right-now,"Our lives tend to run smoothly and predictably most of the time, but they are also prone to intermittent instability with devastating consequences. Can we do more to predict these periods and even intervene to prevent them? For many of us, life seems to progress smoothly and predictably for much of the time. Indeed, it seems one of our biggest concerns appears to be getting stuck in a rut. But then, seemingly out of nowhere, our world is turned upside down. A global pandemic strikes us down, killing millions of people and forcing entire countries into lockdown. Then inflation takes off and economic downturn threatens our livelihoods. And (not unrelated) one country invades another and the resulting war affects us all. Whoa! Where on Earth did all that come from? Comment & Analysis Tim Palmer a Royal Society Research Professor in climate physics at the University of Oxford. His book The Primacy of Doubt (Oxford University Press and Basic Books), describes the science of uncertainty across a range of fundamental and applied sciences. There's a generic reason for these sudden unforeseen catastrophes. It's something commonly found in many ""nonlinear systems"" in the physical, biological and social sciences: intermittent instability. That is to say, after long periods of boring and predictable behaviour, these systems suddenly become wildly unpredictable, exhibiting extreme fluctuations. What is a nonlinear system? It's one whose outputs are not in direct proportion to inputs. We humans are nonlinear systems: if we win $1m (or £1m if you prefer) in the lottery, we will likely be very happy indeed. But if we were to win $4m/£4m, we would likely not be four times as happy. Put more viscerally, if doubling our wealth in the lottery would make us happy, losing our wealth through some stupid gamble would not just make us sad, it would devastate us. Nonlinearity is a key ingredient behind the phenomenon of chaos – the process underpinning the famous butterfly effect – how a small uncertainty can grow and make the whole system unpredictable. However, in chaotic systems, the butterfly effect is not fully at play all the time. Sometimes a chaotic system can be predictable for quite a long period into the future. On other occasions, near an intermittent instability, the flap of a butterfly's wings can destroy predictability over a very short period of time. It's all a consequence of nonlinearity. The weather is a nonlinear chaotic system. It's rather boring and predictable for most of the time but occasionally becomes wildly unpredictable and extreme. In October 1987, BBC weather forecaster Michael Fish told viewers not to worry about strong winds that turned out to be the worst storm southern England had experienced in 300 years, just the day before it happened. Meteorologists learned from this experience. It was realised that the evolution of what has become known in some circles as the ""Fish storm"" was exceptionally sensitive to the butterfly effect – much more so than normal. And so, nowadays, when trying to predict the weather, forecast centres run ensembles of 50 simulations, each differing slightly in their initial conditions (by flaps of meteorological butterfly wings). When the atmosphere is very unstable, as it was in October 1987, then the assorted forecasts within the ensemble will differ dramatically from one another: some will show hurricane-strength extreme weather, others will show much more benign weather. All a forecaster can do in such a situation is estimate some probability, or likelihood, that the extreme event will occur. But forecasting a significant probability for an extreme event is much better than forecasting nothing significant, as happened in 1987. And ensemble weather prediction is today revolutionising the way humanitarian and disaster relief agencies send emergency food, shelter, medicine and even finance to regions at risk of extreme weather. Such anticipatory action is taken when the ensemble-based probabilities for extreme weather exceed a pre-determined threshold. Can we humans influence the likelihood of such intermittent instabilities? Yes, we can. By continuing to emit greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, thus warming and moistening the air, we are tilting our nonlinear climate system towards greater intermittent instability. Perhaps one of the most devastating types of instability is associated with a tipping point, for example associated with the disintegration of a large ice sheet, leading to significant sea-level rise. In this situation, we cannot undo the damage caused by simply reversing our emissions; that would be locking the stable door after the horse has bolted. We have the ability to decrease the likelihood of these climatological instabilities by regulating the emission of greenhouse gases. But which actions will be the most effective?  To guide these decisions, climate scientists try to model the climate system and estimate how climate will change as a result of different conceivable future emissions scenarios. But there are uncertainties in these estimates, not least arising from the effect of these emissions on internal atmospheric processes like cloud cover. Climate scientists try to take account of these uncertainties by running ensembles of climate models where, say, uncertain cloud processes are represented in different possible ways. It is vitally important that our ensembles provide reliable probabilities of damaging climate change. My own view is that we have more to do on the latter and should indeed be pooling our resources internationally to create a new type of ""Cern for climate change"" – an intergovernmental research organisation that will focus on climate science rather than particle physics as Cern does. Even our solar system, often thought of as the most clockwork and predictable system of them all, is chaotic and can exhibit intermittent instability. How to think about X This series will change the way you look at the world. Whether it's the concept of ""time"", ""consumerism"", or even ""creativity"", many of us tend to think about – and define – certain ideas in the ways we've been taught. But how did our conceptualisation of these big ideas evolve? How to Think About X searches for new ideas about our lives, the concepts that govern them and our future. Over a hundred years ago, the French physicist Henri Poincaré showed that there was nothing in principle stopping the planets from being ejected very suddenly from the Solar System. Fortunately, based on ensemble forecasts of the solar system, we can be confident that this type of intermittent instability will not happen in the foreseeable future (in this case many millions of years). However, a mini version of this instability is much more likely: that a small asteroid will be unpredictably ejected from the asteroid belt and will hit Earth with effects similar to one or more nuclear bombs. For this reason, Nasa is improving its near-term asteroid prediction capabilities and is designing the means of diverting rogue asteroids if they do suddenly head for Earth. The Dart mission, where a spacecraft was crashed into the asteroid Dimorphos, successfully tested our ability to deal with the intermittent instabilities of the asteroid belt by changing the course of a space rock that could be Earth-bound. In this case, we have the means to partially control the instabilities and prevent their worst effects.   Could we prevent the occurrence of individual weather events, like the 1987 storm that struck England or the hurricanes that annually plague the east coast of the US, by similar types of intervention? In the 1950s, an idea was mooted to explode nuclear bombs in suitably targeted parts of the atmosphere, to move hurricanes away from their predicted paths if they threatened populated regions. However, notwithstanding the obvious problem of radioactive fallout, the weather is much too complex to be able to do this type of weather control reliably. To have any chance of affecting a severe weather system, the explosion would have to be done many days in advance, before the system had become mature. Estimating where to explode the bomb at this range depends very sensitively on the small-scale details of the forecast atmospheric circulation patterns – get the estimated position for explosion wrong by even few kilometres and the bomb may have little impact on the targeted extreme weather system. Our ability to calculate these sensitive locations, at a forecast range where the technique might in principle work, is just not that good. It's an interesting idea – but (fortunately perhaps) is unlikely to work reliably in practice. But extreme weather is not the only non-linear system to be affecting our lives recently. The spread of Covid-19 was not especially well predicted in the early phases of the disease. However, it spurred the development of epidemiological models for predicting death and hospitalisation arising from Covid infection. As with climate change, these are not so much predictions, as projections: estimates predicated on different policy options, from strict lockdowns to no response at all. However, although the earlier disease models were not themselves especially reliable, as more models with different assumptions were developed, so multi-model ensembles of Covid hospitalisations and deaths became possible by pooling the model outputs together in probabilistic form. These gave much more reliable estimates of plausible worst-case scenarios than could ever be provided by single-model predictions. The global economy is another nonlinear system that can have a profound influence on all our lives. According to the former Bank of England's chief economist, Andy Haldane, the economists had their Michael Fish moment in 2008 when Queen Elizabeth II famously asked an assembly of economists in the City of London why they hadn't seen the financial crash of that year coming. Haldane realised that the type of economic model used by the Bank of England was simply unable to represent the type of intermittent instability that can occur in the financial system. It's relatively easy to describe the conditions where an intermittent financial instability might occur qualitatively. Most of the time a hedge fund damps volatility in the price of a stock by moving the stock towards its intrinsic worth. However, the banks lend the hedge funds money, and to contain their risk, the banks limit the amount they are prepared to lend. Now suppose a stock's value falls when the hedge fund is fully leveraged. The hedge fund will have to sell its stock to pay off part of the loan. But selling the stock in this way can cause the stock to fall further in value. This makes it even harder for the hedge fund to pay back the loan. Perhaps not only the hedge fund, but also the bank will go broke if this behaviour is widespread. In this way, a sort of death-spiral instability for the whole economy is set in motion, especially if that economy is dependent on the health of its financial sector.   The problem is that traditional neo-classical models of the macroeconomy simply do not include such microscale processes. A new type of model – an agent-based model – seeks to do this. Here the model attempts to integrate the action of individual agents, such as businesses, industries, banks and hedge funds, from the ground up. The philosophy underpinning such models is not much different to a weather forecast model where the individual agents are small grid squares (of a few kilometres in horizontal scale) describing weather variables on some assumed elemental scale. The mathematics of agent-based models is messy, unlike the elegant but less useful mathematics of neo-classical economic models. But that's the way the world can be – rather messy. You might also like to read: Ensemble prediction methods based on agent-based models are being developed to predict probabilistically intermittent instabilities in the financial sector. However, compared with weather and climate prediction, these developments are at a very early stage. And of course, our ability to predict the economy does depend on whether the world is at peace or at war. One of the pioneers of quantitative weather prediction, Lewis Fry Richardson, also developed some of the first quantitative conflict prediction models. Conflict prediction is also starting to develop into a mature field using agent-based models, and again ensemble prediction techniques, where key uncertainties are varied across ensemble members, is vital to produce reliable probabilistic predictions. These models did highlight the Ukraine as a potential hot spot for conflict, ahead of Russia's invasion. Let's put all this together. Intermittent instabilities are a feature of many nonlinear systems in nature and in global society. On the whole their impacts appear to be profoundly negative, disrupting our lives in a bad way. How can we deal with these instabilities? Perhaps we can stop them happening at all. In the case of a rogue asteroid, this indeed seems possible. In the case of weather or indeed the economy, the systems are too complex for this to be feasible. However, for the latter examples, we can make the occurrence of intermittent instabilities less likely even if we cannot eliminate them altogether, such as by regulating the emissions of greenhouse gases on the one hand, or by regulating financial transactions in highly leveraged situations on the other. We can also try to take precautionary actions to mitigate the impacts of instabilities when they are predicted. However, by their nature, these instabilities are difficult to predict and can depend sensitively on uncertain parts of the system. To reliably predict the occurrence of instabilities, ensemble prediction systems must be developed where individual ensemble members differ in the representation of the uncertain parts of the system. The result is not a deterministic but a probabilistic forecast of the instability. Whether it is worth taking precautionary action in the light of such a forecast will then depend on the cost of action, the unmitigated damage caused by the instability, and on the forecast probability of occurrence of the event. If the first is small enough, or the last two large enough, then it will be worth it. (Read more about the tricks you can use to navigate uncertainty.) Ensemble prediction has become a fairly mature field in weather and climate prediction, has accelerated in disease modelling due to Covid-19, and is slowly evolving as a field in economics and conflict prediction, due to the development of agent-based models. Perhaps in future years, the ""Whoa! Where did that come from?"" reaction as another intermittent instability hits us from one of a number of different possible directions, may be heard less often.  * Tim Palmer is a professor of climate physics at the University of Oxford and pioneered the development of probabilistic ensemble forecasting techniques for weather and climate prediction. -- Join one million Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.

Volatility,Will flying get more expensive?,2024-09-25,2020-05-29,John Walton,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200528-will-the-price-of-flights-increase-due-to-coronavirus,"Covid-19 has caused unprecedented turmoil in the aviation industry. What does that mean for pricing when planes take to the skies again? As more countries start to ease their Covid-19 lockdowns, attention is returning to the global aviation industry, almost entirely grounded for months. Some passenger airlines have kept skeleton fleets flying for repatriation missions, some have converted passenger jets to use as cargo planes, but all of them would much rather return to their primary objective: flying people safely around the world. But when planes do take to the skies again, how much impact will the pandemic have on what they charge? “We know airlines want to get planes back in the air and bums back on seats,” says Benjamin Cany from Amadeus, a technology company that provides IT services to the travel industry, including one of its principal booking systems. In the short-term at least, that would point to lower fares aimed at incentivising consumers. Yet look past the next few months and there are factors that could push fares up, from airline bankruptcies that could reduce both supply and competition, to reduced fleets caused by retiring aircraft early. And the great unknown is how quickly passengers will return to flying, with the general feeling in the industry that aviation won’t return to pre-pandemic numbers until 2022, 2023 or beyond.   Airlines, Cany says, usually look at past demand to forecast future trends. But there’s no precedent for the current circumstances. “What are airlines to do when the past data is radically different, or no longer relevant for future calculations?” The pricing equation Airline pricing, explains Cany, is normally based on a combination of scientific calculations and models. This, he says, “is about understanding the customer's motivation to travel and how much they are willing to pay for the ticket. Airlines then balance that against capacity, and a myriad other indicators. The airline wants to strike the best deal for the airline and the traveller.” This is both a science and an art. The science, Cany says, “is in the modelling, machine learning and algorithms behind this calculation” and would usually include “the choice between the different airline products (for example, business versus premium economy) and the various airline itineraries available (departure time, arrival time, trip duration). That needs to be combined with historical data, seasonality, as well as market indicators such as upcoming local events, competition on that same route, and so forth.” The art, meanwhile, comes from “the airline’s pricing and revenue management experts, who adjust these indicators to develop the most accurate forecast. That’s where the technology helps, providing these teams with the tools to improve the forecast accuracy to the highest degree,” Cany concludes. But nobody knows how the models that aviation has been honing for decades will change as a result of the extraordinary Covid-19 challenges, particularly given the situation is still evolving. When will demand return? In the most basic of economic terms, for example, airline fares are set based on a supply curve and a demand curve. Airlines usually have the lever of supply under their control, and it’s generally understood that when they want to stimulate demand to fill capacity, they reduce fares. More people will travel if a ticket is $50 than if it is $100. The X factor right now is that many people are scared to travel because of hygiene concerns, lockdown guidance and quarantine rules.  “Short-term, aircraft will continue to be much less full and airlines will be motivated to price seats to get customers flying safely in a Covid-19 world,” says Joe Leader, chief executive officer of APEX, a trade association whose members include airlines and their suppliers. “Airlines have cut back their flights to absolute connectivity minimums and are losing money on the vast majority of remaining flights… Hopefully, the combination of increased Covid-19 safety measures alongside low prices will encourage a travel rebound.” Paul Simmons, a senior airline executive with experience at numerous airlines worldwide including easyJet and Malaysia Airlines, suggests much will depend on what part low pricing can play as a tool to persuade people to travel. “It could be that airlines find their traditional lever of low pricing to drive bums on seats does not work as well as it used to. People may have higher concerns.” The general view is that domestic travel will recover first, a view with which Peter Foster, CEO of Kazakhstan’s national carrier Air Astana, agrees. “Initial indications from our recently-restarted limited domestic flights are that there is pent-up demand for these routes. We believe that business, worker and student travel will recover well before leisure travel.” IATA, an airline trade association, expects low demand when countries first start to travel again, despite some business travellers needing to fly and a desire for what’s known as VFR — visiting friends and relatives — traffic as people miss their families. On the plus side for airlines, IATA notes that the biggest variable cost in aviation, fuel, will be low: as drivers in many places are noticing, there’s oversupply in the petroleum industry keeping prices down. Will supply fall?  If there are major unknowns on the demand side, there are also evolving factors influencing pricing on the supply side. One of the starkest images for the airline industry has been the sight of line after line of jets parked on runways and put into storage at aircraft recycling ‘boneyards’. While older and less efficient planes will be retired, some of them years ahead of schedule, airline executive Paul Simmons points out that most of the planes taken out of fleets have been stored, not scrapped. “This is an important distinction,” he says. Joe Leader from airline association APEX suggests that “there will be more than enough supply even with all of the early aircraft retirements”. Certainly to start off with, demand will be low enough to be met by the aircraft that haven’t been retired. Airbus and Boeing have both announced cuts to the numbers of new aircraft they’re building every month, but as demand rises again, the aircraft manufacturers can increase production, airlines can extend the life of aircraft they’re using, or older aircraft can be brought back into use from storage. It’s already clear that the airline landscape, and indeed the names painted on the side of the aircraft, are likely to be forever changed. Some airlines have already filed for various forms of bankruptcy protection or indeed have simply gone under. This will, in many cases, lead to less competition – and the possibility of monopoly pricing, which tends not to favour consumers. Yet it’s likely that regulators will come down hard on airlines seen to profiteer, while other carriers will seek to jump into monopoly markets where that is possible, or new entrants will arise. For passengers, that’s likely to mean a fair amount of volatility in fares. “Although some airlines will inevitably go out of business, others will scale up to fill the void,” comments Simmons. “The ‘rightsizing’ of supply and demand may take time, however, leading to higher pricing in the medium term.” No easy answers The watchword for aviation, as for so many industries looking to rebound from Covid-19, is going to be uncertainty. New waves of infection, or treatment breakthroughs, would both influence the future path. So too will political and regulatory responses, as well as the wider global economic fallout that is being forecast. Demand, crucially, is not rising evenly; different government restrictions ­– especially quarantine periods on arrival for travellers from some nations – will have effects that are very complex to model, and will necessarily differ between nations or even within regions of the same nation. The US is an example of how perceptions and thus demand can vary across a nation. Scott DeAngelo, chief marketing officer of niche leisure carrier Allegiant Air, said on an earnings call that customer surveys revealed that “in the Midwest and Mid Atlantic, the Upper West, I got to tell you they don’t share the opinion that the evening news is putting out there” around travel. Pictures over the US Memorial Day holiday weekend have shown leisure destinations in some parts of the country packed with partygoers. It seems likely that travel resumption “bubbles” between neighbouring countries and regions with acceptably low infection rates (where “acceptably” will also vary) will continue, and while these may stimulate demand travellers will also not want to be caught overseas if restrictions return swiftly. The question of whether any travel insurance would cover Covid-19-related issues is also crucial. Airlines also need to start flying for people to start buying tickets even in a reduced demand scenario, and we are only just starting to see a very limited number of airlines resuming very limited schedules. That all makes predicting the effects of the interlocking factors upon which airline pricing is based challenging. The demand side of the curve is particularly tricky for long-haul pricing, says Air Astana CEO Peter Foster, who nevertheless expects that the stronger long-haul airlines are likely to try to kickstart demand with lower fares. Short-haul carriers, meanwhile, may benefit from low oil prices, reduced aircraft prices that enable counter-cyclical orders and lower salaries due to surplus aviation workers. “The prognosis may well be lower airfares on short/medium haul routes for at least 18 months to two years,” Foster expects. And while Covid-19 is unprecedented, he believes the past can offer indicators for future trends. “After every major crisis of the last 20 years – the Asian financial crisis of 1998, 9/11, the global financial crisis – low-cost airlines have emerged faster and stronger because suppressed demand combined with depressed consumer spending power has driven people to them,” he says. “I doubt 2020/21 will be any different.” Aviation journalist John Walton writes about airlines, aircraft and everything aeronautical.

Volatility,The one-company workers who never leave,2024-09-25,2022-10-10,Alex Christian,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20221005-the-one-company-workers-who-never-leave,"Expected tenure in a role has shrunk at an alarming pace amid the Great Resignation. But some workers are reaping the rewards of spending decades in the same job. As the labour market has favoured workers throughout the past two years, many employees have taken advantage of the changing employment landscape, becoming job-hoppers and industry-switchers. While job opportunities thrive, this reshuffling has upended the idea of the ‘company man’, making it seem outdated at best.  Yet although this swath of highly-mobile workers has stolen much of the conversation around employment in the pandemic-era, plenty of other workers have still chosen to stay in one place. Moving roles may be tempting, but factors such as strong organisational culture, clear career pathways and job security have more allure for some employees. And they’re happy with their choice to stay put at the same place they’ve worked for years and years.  According to workers and experts, there are two main reasons employees remain with companies for life. First, some large companies are set up to develop, promote and retain workers in ways others are not, which means ambitious employees can reach the pinnacle of their careers without ever changing jobs. In other cases, employees may prioritise financial comfort and stability, see their career as a means to an end, and occupy their niche until retirement.  Climbing the ranks  The need to advance in life and achieve is innate, says Allan Lee, a senior lecturer in organisation studies and management at University of Exeter Business School, UK. A single company can fulfil this desire, and meet the needs of ambitious workers, by providing a well-defined career pathway and a sense of progression. “Feeling that you’re building towards a goal is a strong motivator in staying in a job,” says Lee. New York-based architect Nick began at his firm in an entry-level position 30 years ago, then quickly ascended the ranks. Each promotion gave him the opportunity to work on bigger and more prestigious projects, designing developments in some of the most coveted neighbourhoods in the US. “I was motivated by being in a company where I was encouraged to grow: one where I thought my contribution was valued,” he explains. As Nick accumulated more experience, he took on more senior roles, leading colleagues on global multimillion-dollar projects, from Manhattan to Shanghai. “I was lucky I could build a team of people motivated to work together and investigate architecture,” he says. “It meant it was more than just doing a job: there was a culture that allowed everyone to deliver meaningful work.” Nick is now at the pinnacle of his career: an executive and design leader for his firm. Through decades of experience, he’s been able to command a wealth of knowledge, inspire the direction of his company and be part of its history. “When I joined the firm, it was 35 people in one office – now it’s 1,100 employees, in 24 studios around the world,” he explains. “I think longevity builds respect and trust, and a chance to build something bigger than yourself.” Comfort and security  Not every worker who remains at their employer for decades will necessarily steadily climb the top of the career ladder like Nick. Some employees may be content in a stable, mid-level ranking until retirement.  “They may value mastering a position and obtaining the role of an expert,” says Johnny C Taylor Jr, the president and CEO of the Society for Human Resource Management (Shrm), based in Washington, DC. “This then allows them to enjoy stability, routine and a greater work-life balance, versus higher-level management and executive positions.”  Moves also come with risk: career stability and comfort can persuade employees to remain at an organisation. Further, financial practicalities can mean an organisation offering steady pay rises and pension plans is more able to lock in workers for the long haul. “Uncertainty can be a source of stress,” says Lee. “People want security. And although staying at one company for life may no longer be the expectation, someone knowing they have a job for the foreseeable future can be a strong motivator to remain.”  Lifetime employment is typically more common in long-established multinational corporations, where good pension provision, transparent pay structures and varied departments mean workers may have less incentive to search the job market for a fulfilling career elsewhere. “If the job offers what people have always sought from work – a way to make a decent living as well as find dignity and fulfilment – then employee loyalty is much easier to come by,” says Rick Wartzman, of management thinktank the Drucker Institute, and author of The End of Loyalty, based in Los Angeles.  Public-sector roles can also offer employees greater long-term stability. “Private sector businesses are more impacted by market volatility and generally can be subject to employment at will,” says Taylor, “whereas the public sector is more likely to offer pension plans and job security.” One such worker is Anthony. He joined the Civil Service in the 1970s as an 18-year-old, working in a government department assessing the tax valuations of properties in suburban London. He remained in the same department until 2017, reaching management level and retiring early on a pension reflecting his final salary. “I wasn’t someone [who was] that career-driven,” he says. “It was my first job after finishing school, I just wanted something that would offer a good salary and long-term stability: it was all I needed.”  ‘Why stay?’  Ambition isn't universal. If an organisation can keep a worker busy, relatively happy, engaged and decently remunerated, some people will stay. Although Anthony says he ultimately saw work as a means to an end, he was quietly content being able to lead a team, form workplace friendships and confidently carry out technical, time-consuming work. “I never really considered leaving: it was a job I enjoyed and it gave me financial security.”  Relationships and loyalty are also crucial factors in an employee choosing to stay at one company for so long. “It’d be unhealthy if you didn’t ever question ‘why stay?’,” says Nick. “But I’m dedicated to the people who have stood by me, and there are always opportunities to do better. And when you have a family to support there is value in stability.” Workers may choose to stay at one employer for decades because of an inbuilt drive to feel a sense of belonging, says Lee. “An employee may be less likely to change jobs if they feel they’re losing a part of themselves by leaving: our social identity often comes from groups; the workplace can be a strong source of that. And a main predictor of whether someone stays in a job or not is whether they feel they have good relationships with their leaders and co-workers.”  Today, the expectation is that no job is for life; workers increasingly feel compelled to change jobs to appear dynamic. However, even as expectations around employee tenure and the job-seeking mindset change, a subset of the workforce will still choose to spend decades at the same organisation. Some will lurk happily in solid roles that meet their lifestyle needs; others will soar up companies that offer development and progression.  “I’m in a leadership position now: how I do as a leader sets up other people for success,” says Nick. “There’s nothing more satisfying than working with a group of people and, together, producing something that’s bigger than all of you – something that has a positive impact.”"
Volatility,My savings suddenly disappeared,2024-09-25,2016-04-18,Kate Ashford,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20160415-it-was-jaw-dropping,"An emergency or sudden market downturn depletes the savings you’ve worked so hard to build. Here's what to do when you go broke and run out of money. Jon Dulin and his wife were doing all the right things financially. They put money away for retirement and had a solid emergency fund. That is, until they noticed that there was staining on the outside of their house, around the windows and gutters. “We found out that it was actually a pretty big problem,” said Dulin, 37, who lives in Pennsylvania in the US. Due to poor construction, water was getting trapped in the walls of their house, rotting the wood. The repair cost: $50,000. “It was jaw dropping,” said Dulin, who writes at MoneySmartGuides.com. “This is basically wiping out our emergency fund.” Because of the unexpected dent in their savings, the couple will have to slow their retirement savings for the next few years while they rebuild their emergency money. “It’s frustrating.” An unexpected — and major — expense is just one way your savings could take a bad turn. A losing stock market turn could also wipe out years of savings. Just ask anyone who lost money when stocks plunged in 2008. In the US, workers lost an average of 24% from their 401(k) retirement accounts that year. And more than half of US parents with 529 college savings plans saw their balances go down in 2008, with almost a quarter reporting a decline of more than 30%. In the UK, the 2008 financial crisis led to an £815bn ($1.16tn) decrease in wealth overall — an average of almost £31,000 ($44,190) per household — because of a plunge in housing prices and a drop in the value of pension funds and investments. When your savings suddenly disappear, what you do next matters. “The bottom line is that you now have fewer resources than you expected,” said Mark LaSpisa, a financial planner with Vermillion Financial Advisors in Illinois in the US. “So you need to make some decisions.” Here are a few strategies for dealing with a big financial hit. What it will take: You’ll need patience, fortitude and the ability to look at the big picture. Losing a lot of money can be stressful and daunting, and you’ll have to make smart, but possibly different, decisions about saving and spending moving forward. How long you need to prepare: Most big financial losses come as a surprise, but there are things you can do to absorb the hit. A healthy emergency fund with three to six months of living expenses can give you breathing room while you weigh your options — or even cover an expense in the short term. If your investment portfolio has taken a dive, it’s important to take some time to consider your options rather than take money out in a reactionary way. One option is to borrow strategically. Sometimes it pays to use debt in the short-term while your savings recover, rather than withdrawing money from a decimated portfolio. “In 2009 one recently retired client chose to borrow money on her line of credit, rather than pull money from her IRA,” which had seen a loss, said David Demming, a financial planner with Demming Financial Services in Ohio in the US. “You want to have choices, which is why liquidity is so important. We use debt selectively, in lieu of assets, in certain environments.” When interest rates are near zero or very low, as they have been the last several years, this might make even more sense. Do it now: Assess the impact. “Now is the time to look objectively at all income streams and outgoings and see if savings in expenditures or increases in income from other sources could make up for some of the impact of the recent loss,” said Peter Brooke, a financial planner with the Spectrum IFA Group in Valbonne, France. “Are there things that could be sold or small jobs that could be undertaken to bring in a bit more money?” Work longer. If retirement is the thing in danger, you might have to rethink your retirement date. “I frequently counsel people that they should work a year or two or three years more, or once they go into retirement, take a part-time job,” said Larry Luxenberg, a financial planner with Lexington Avenue Capital Management in New York in the US. If you’re working at a job now making $100,000 a year, you might not think that working part time and making $20,000 in retirement is worth it. “But it could be the critical piece that lets you have a comfortable retirement,” Luxenberg said. Work more. Alternatively, a part-time job or some freelance or consulting work on the side could cover an unexpected expense or replenish your depleted savings faster. Spend less. Planning to buy a house with a down payment that was just obliterated? Consider renting or purchasing something more affordable. Ponder buying a used car rather than a new one, which depreciates the moment you drive it off the lot. Or take a road trip for your next vacation rather than flying, to save on airfares. “It’s really sitting down and investigating your options and figuring out what’s best for you,” LaSpisa said. “In most cases it’s some kind of logical compromise.” Don’t panic. Stock markets are cyclical. If your portfolio has plunged during a downturn and you don’t need the money immediately, don’t be too quick to cash in all your holdings. “If you’re invested in the stock market, your portfolio is going to go up and down,” Luxenberg said. “If you have a widely diversified portfolio, it’s highly likely to come back. Retirement plan investors in the US who maintained their stock allocation after the 2008 and 2009 downturn showed average account balance increases of 50% by mid-2011, according to one study. And according to another, continuous participants in retirement plans between December 2008 and December 2013 saw median account balance growth of 182%.   By the same token, if it’s your home value that’s plummeted, don’t worry unless you need to move. “If my home goes down in value, but I am not planning on either moving or extracting cash from it, has anything really changed other than the number on a given line of my balance sheet?” said David Mendels, a financial planner with Creative Financial Concepts in New York. “While all losses are painful, they are not all the same.” This one, for the most part, could just be in your head. Consult your financial professional. An objective third party can lend some perspective on where you are and whether your shortfall is going to wreck your financial picture. It may be that there are resources you haven’t considered and that a few small tweaks to your plan could put you on the right track. Do it later: Decrease risk appropriately. As you approach a big milestone — college, retirement — consider putting more of the money you need into lower-risk investments. That way, you aren’t as vulnerable to a market tank right before you need the cash. Do it smarter: Keep at it. “Honestly, the biggest mistake is giving up,” said Shannon Simmons, a financial planner with Simmons Financial Planning in Toronto. “A financial blow can be devastating and really hard on motivation. Many people who have suffered a large financial loss risk hitting the ‘screw-it’ point — the point where you stop trying.” This can lead to spiralling consumer debt, a stop to savings or an unhealthy fear of market volatility, none of which is helpful. “The most important thing to do is keep trying,” Simmons said. “Make a plan that is realistic. Don’t set yourself up for failure with lofty goals that are completely unrealistic. Take it a little bit at a time to rebuild. Don’t lose hope.” To comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Capital, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter."
Volatility,Why a desert city imports its sand,2024-09-25,2016-05-05,Renuka Rayasam,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20160502-even-desert-city-dubai-imports-its-sand-this-is-why,"The global construction boom has created huge demand for sand – even in cities surrounded by the coarse commodity. Sand. We take it for granted. From deserts to beaches to children’s playgrounds, it seems ubiquitous. Yet the abundant resource is feeding a global land grab that’s even bred a sand-smuggling underworld. While researching beach erosion in Negril, Jamaica about six years ago, scientist Pascal Peduzzi’s conversation with residents in a fishing village left him astounded. Despite the high-tech geospatial modelling and remote sensing tools he was using to survey the damage, he’d never have surmised one reason for erosion on the country’s western coastline. Locals told him about the local mafias — armed men who came to the beach in the middle of night, hauled away bags of sand and sold them for the construction of beachfront developments. “I was shocked that people would fight for sand,” said Peduzzi, director of science at the United Nations Environment Programme’s Division of Early Warning and Assessment. “I have been working for more than 20 years in the environment sector, but sand came to me as a surprise.” As a building material, sand has withstood the test of time. In 3500BC, ancient Egyptians and Mesopotamians were using sand, mostly formed when wind and water grind rocks into silica-rich grains, to make glass. Today, builders the world over use the natural resource, found in quarries, rivers, lakes and oceans, for many of their materials including paint and cement. With a global building boom and the arrival of hydraulic fracturing technology for oil and gas in the United States, the demand for sand has been skyrocketing. In 2014, 196 million tons of sand and its bigger counterpart gravel were mined around the world, according to the US Geological Survey. After water, it’s the most abundantly used natural resource, Peduzzi said. It’s used in everything from swimming-pool filters, metal castings and oil wells to smartphone screens and toothpaste. The overall sand and gravel market was valued at $8.3bn in the US last year and £1.7bn ($2.5bn) in the UK in 2013, according to the USGS and the UK’s Mineral Products Association. Global demand for sand is expected to rise 5.5% a year through 2018, according to a December 2014 report from the Freedonia Group. Investors willing to weather the volatility, sift through the fragmented market and take on potential environmental risks could stand to profit from the growing appetite for this global commodity. For years the sand market had been pretty “boring,” said Sonny Randhawa, a vice president in charge of research for the energy sector at D.A. Davidson, an Oregon based investment firm. But in the past few years the sand market has been more “feast or famine”, he said, particularly in the US. Uneven global demand Demand for sand is spread unevenly across the globe. Building booms in China and India have increased the need for sand in those markets. Globally, China accounts for a fifth of the world’s sand imports, according to the Trade Statistics Branch of the United Nations.  Because of the frenzied development of new dams, roads, buildings and factories the country has used more sand in the last four years than the US has in the last century, according to Peduzzi. China has even been piling huge amounts of sand onto reefs to create new islands and expand its foothold in the South China Sea. Even the United Arab Emirates imported $456m worth of sand, stone and gravel in 2014, according to the UN. Despite being in the heart of the desert, imported sand built Dubai, according to Pascal. Wind-formed desert sand is too smooth for construction. Meanwhile, in the UK, the need for sand has dropped off as new construction cools and recyclables get a political push. Demand for rock, gravel and sand is 25% below 2007 levels, according to the UK Mineral Products Association.  And in the US, the rise of hydraulic fracturing or “fracking” has created a huge appetite for sand. In 2013, the production of sand for fracking wells was 19 times higher than a decade earlier, according to the USGS. The process involves injecting water, sand and chemicals down a horizontally drilled well thousands of feet below the earth’s surface into a rock formation to extract oil or natural gas. While the market for industrial sand has tracked overall economic growth in the US, the demand for frac sand has been as volatile as oil prices. From 2011 to 2014 the demand for frac sand more than doubled from 24 million tons to 59 million tons, but then dropped off last year to 50 million tons, said Randhawa. But even as oil prices tail off, demand for sand is growing, largely due to the increased amount of sand going into wells in an attempt to extract more oil, according to Marc Bianchi, a managing director at Cowen and Company. As fracturing technology becomes better at extracting more oil per well, the amount of sand used per well has also doubled, from 2,000 tons a well in the second quarter of 2013 to 4,400 tons in the fourth quarter of 2015, he said.  How to invest It takes deep pockets and pioneering spirit to buy up a sand mine or offshore facility directly. Many countries regulate sand extraction, handing out a limited number of licenses to prevent overmining. And the technology to extract, process and transport sand will likely be far too expensive for individual investors.   Even investing in existing sand companies requires untangling complex layers across the value chain, from smaller mom-and-pop operations that may own a single mine, to large multinational players like Belgium-based Sibelco Group, a 144-year-old company that operates in 41 countries, or Germany’s Heidelberg Cement, which makes and sells cement in 40 countries and owns and operates sand facilities globally. For the most part, the highly fragmented market is regionally focused. On the European side, the European Association of Industrial Silica Producers maintains a comprehensive list of major players on the continent. In the US, 230 companies have 335 sand operations across 35 states, according to the USGS. Within the past few years, four US sand companies have started selling shares on the New York Stock Exchange and Randhawa has “buy” ratings on all them. Two of the companies — Emerge Energy Services and Hi Crush Partners — focus exclusively on the frac sand market, while Fairmount Minerals and U.S. Silica also have industrial sand operations. Because of their recent listings, Randhawa said that it’s tough to track returns, but with unpredictable oil prices, investors willing to take the risk should be prepared for volatility. Both Randhawa and Bianchi believe that U.S. Silica, which has been around since 1900, is best prepared to survive the roller coaster. They said the company’s long-standing customers provide the company a stable source of revenue even if demand for frac sand levels off. Plus, the company has been churning out new sand-related products such as adding antimicrobial coating to swimming pool-filter sand. Future concerns Finally, there are legal and environmental concerns to think about around the world. Beaches have eroded on average 40m from 1968 to 2008, according to Peduzzi. In some areas, such as South Carolina and California in the US, erosion from overmining and global warming has measured hundreds of metres. In other parts of the world, islands have disappeared altogether. “We do still have a huge amount of sand,” said Peduzzi. But “because we use it so much, sand is becoming rare. That’s not to say we should stop using sand, but we should be a bit more cautious.” This story was produced under the BBC's guidelines for financial journalism.

Volatility,The gold mine beneath London's streets,2024-09-25,2016-04-19,Pádraig Belton,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20160419-the-city-with-248-billion-beneath-its-pavement,"Under London’s streets lies a hidden gold mine. It stretches across more than 300,000 square feet under the City, the finance quarter in the heart of Britain’s capital. There, beneath the pavement and commuters of Threadneedle Street, lies a maze of eight Bank of England gold vaults – each stacked with gold bars worth a total sum of around £141 billion ($200 billion). The bars sit on rows of blue numbered shelves. Every bar weighs precisely 400 troy ounces (about 12kg), making each currently worth some £350,000 ($500,000), comfortably more than the average price of a house in the UK. Each bar looks subtly different depending on where it was refined. Some bars have sloping edges to make them easier to pick up; others look more like a loaf of bread. There is no smell here: metal has none. There is no noise, either, on account of the vaults’ thick concrete walls. What there is, however, is one of the world’s most important traded assets. Deals are still done in gold in almost every country in the world. Its price is a crucial barometer for consumer confidence. Prices rise when markets are uncertain, and before US elections – like now. “Gold is a hedge against uncertainty,” says Jonathan Spall, a long-time gold trader and now managing director of G Cubed Metal. These vaults lie right at the heart of this volatile, incredibly important market. About one-fifth of all the gold held by the world’s governments is in London. In total, 6,256 tonnes of gold are stored in vaults in and around London – collectively worth about £172 billion ($248 billion). The Bank of England vaults alone hold 5,134 tonnes, including the official reserves of the UK Treasury and the vast majority of the physical gold traded in London. Gold owned by 30 other countries is also in these vaults along with the hoards of about 25 banks. So much gold is kept in Britain’s capital partly to keep it near where the metal is traded. It’s also a reflection of the security of London’s vaults. Hiding your stash The Bank of England vaults were built in the 1930s. During World War II, when Britain’s bullion was secretly moved to Canada to continue the war effort if Britain was overrun, one vault was used as a staff canteen for Bank of England employees. Vintage advertisements for the P&O cruise line, enticing Bank employees away to holiday, are still plastered across the walls. Later, in the 1940s, the vault was used as a bomb shelter. But since 1945, the vaults have been used primarily for gold. Storing your assets in a huge safe might seem more fitting for a Tudor monarchy than a modern central bank. But the Bank of England still uses not only vaults, but several 3ft-long keys for access. Insiders believe that electronic access alone could be more prone to abuse. (You do still have to speak a password into a microphone and a computer matches your voice against a saved sample). The bars arrive in London by surprisingly traditional methods, too. Some come by sea, shipped from refineries like PAMP in Switzerland or Rand Refinery outside Johannesburg in South Africa. Gold is also moved on regular passenger aeroplanes. “In the cargo hold of commercial passenger planes, you often find gold, fresh flowers, and dead bodies,” says Ruth Crowell, chief executive of the London Bullion Market Association. But more difficult than finding transport can be finding a place to house it. Because much of the City of London is on clay ground and because gold is such a dense substance, you can only stack the bars so high before the vault starts sinking into the clay, Crowell says. (The weight of a City skyscraper is spread over a larger footprint, which makes that risk less likely). This is less of a problem in other cities. In Manhattan, which sits on bedrock, the Federal Reserve Bank can stack bars from floor to ceiling. As a result, there are restrictions on how much gold can be stacked in the Bank’s vaults. On the top level, the gold bars can only be stacked four pallets high. On the lower, they can only be stacked up to six. This means London needs to spread out its gold more to stop it sinking, and needs more vaults of smaller sizes. As a result, it isn’t just the City’s streets that are paved with gold. There are seven smaller vaults inside the M25 (the motorway that encircles Greater London) owned by banks like JP Morgan and HSBC, including three at transport companies around Heathrow Airport. Each owner attempts to keep their vault’s location secret. When CNBC journalists visited JP Morgan in 2011, for example, they had to surrender their mobile phones and travel in a car with blacked-out windows. Getting your gold fix It isn’t just vault locations that are kept under wraps. The gold market itself is secretive and steeped in tradition and ritual, particularly around the fixing system used for setting the price. The price setting meetings or “fixes” – in which there are now 12 direct participants hailing from the UK, US, Canada, China and France – take place twice a day. When a price matches supply and demand, the price is fixed. Until 2015, this was done verbally: a chairman would try different prices on the participants, each of whom would say if, at that price, they would be buyers or sellers. From 1919 until 2004 fixes were done in person in the City of London. Originally, if a participant wished to pause proceedings – to change between buying and selling, for example – he would raise a small UK flag. In 2004, the fixes were moved to a conference call. Only last year did the system change to a more modern electronic auction platform run by the Intercontinental Exchange, which also owns the New York Stock Exchange. “If everyone knows there are two key points in the day to show up, you get the best liquidity balance between buying and selling,” says Matthew Glenville, chief operating officer of the Intercontinental Exchange Benchmark Administration. This ‘spot’ price is then used as a benchmark for people buying and selling gold around the world, a market where transactions total around £85 billion ($120 billion) a day. Portable assets During good times, gold is less in demand. But when the economy is tough, the metal is highly prized as a safe haven asset – not quite like storing cash under the mattress, but still a way to hedge against risk in other markets. As a result, gold increases in value when markets are volatile. Since the 1,000-point Dow Jones plunge of August 2015, the average price of the morning fix has increased each month, rising from £705 ($1,000) in December to £870 ($1,250) in March. When stock markets slump, governments and private investors ditch equities and buy gold – like Russia and China are doing now. Even so, only 32% of the world’s yellow metal is actually held by governments, banks and investors under lock and key. About 12% is used industrially, such as in electronics circuits. And more than half is used for jewellery. China and India are particularly significant markets for jewellery, together accounting for half of world demand. In India alone, an average of 30 to 40 grams of gold are purchased for each of the country’s 10 million weddings each year. “China and India, between the two of them, accounted for less than 10% of global demand in 2000,” says Ross Norman, chief executive of the bullion dealer Sharps Pixley. “Now it’s north of 90%.” With the current volatility of major currencies and stock markets, it’s little surprise that gold has returned to fashion. One sign? The opening of London’s first high street gold showroom in January. Sharps Pixley is located directly across from the private clubs White’s and Boodle’s in the heart of the upmarket St James’s neighbourhood. The building, which is owned by The Apprentice star Lord Sugar, has an exclusive and club-like interior with dark timber, brass and a large chandelier. If you want to get your hands on some bullion today, Sharps Pixley sells gold over the counter, in bars ranging from a kilogram (£28,058) down to one gram (£33.89). But with prices on the increase, you’d best bring your gold card. This story is a part of BBC Britain – a series focused on exploring this extraordinary island, one story at a time.

Volatility,A wild week for Bitcoin,2024-09-25,2017-12-01,Bryan Lufkin,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20171201-the-wild-week-of-bitcoin,"Are we talking tulips or a 1990s tech stock? Or could this be the future of money? This week has been a rollercoaster ride for Bitcoin – and could signal an equally unpredictable future. What happened this week? The eight-year-old cryptocurrency has pulled in droves of investors in recent months. But this week it hit record-breaking highs, soaring over $10,000 (£7,493) in value. At the start of 2017 a Bitcoin was worth just $1,000. And yet within 24 hours of hitting the benchmark it had climbed past $11,000 before losing nearly 20% of its value, to just barely $9,000. This rollercoaster ride, and resulting headlines, prompted the Bank of England to warn “investors should do their homework” on Bitcoin: some say the currency is peaking and based on nothing but a speculative bubble, while others feel it could have further to rise. “This week is no different,” says David Yermack, professor of finance and business transformation at New York University. “Bitcoin has always been very volatile. Anybody who invests should have a large amount of risk tolerance.” Remind me, what exactly is it? Ten years ago, the idea of a futuristic, invisible currency – one that’s not linked to any government and that lives on the internet – might have been dismissed as a possible line from The Matrix or Blade Runner. But that’s what it is: a digital alternative to notes or coins. It’s still not an official currency as it’s not issued by any government. It can be used as payment online and can be transferred digitally, avoiding the bureaucratic quicksand of banking hours, transaction fees, and waiting periods. The total nominal value of every bitcoin in existence – the first type of digital currency of its kind – is now over $167 billion. What comes next? Some say breaching the $10,000 mark signals a new chapter for Bitcoin. “We’re in the second inning of a nine-inning baseball game,” says Ronnie Moas, founder and director of research at Standpoint Research, who specialises in investment, stock, and cryptocurrency recommendations. “What do you think is going to happen when this goes mainstream?” He thinks it could end up being as lucrative as Amazon or Google stock, and for him it is worth risking a decent sum in Bitcoin, rather getting caught on the sidelines. “In the direction we are headed, there are going to be 200 million people trying to get their hands on a few million Bitcoin.” Moas believes the $10,000 mark is “basically a stamp of approval,” almost like a celebrity endorsement. “When it was at $1,000, it had no credibility – now people are saying ‘this looks interesting’.” Not everyone is so bullish. “It’s a bubble that’s going to give a lot of people a lot of exciting times as it rides up and then goes down,” Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz told Bloomberg. Bitcoin’s relevance to the average person on the street, however, is still a little intangible. Although there are a handful of exceptions, you can’t use Bitcoin in most shops because its legal status varies by country. In many places, the cryptocurrency’s semi-anonymous nature stokes fears of money laundering or an increased sale of illegal goods. Government intervention? While some think Bitcoin is the future of money, others think that the party will inevitably screech to an halt once governments get serious about trying to regulate it. Right now? “It’s a total mess,” says Tadge Dryja, research scientist at MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative, when describing the decentralised nature of Bitcoin – meaning, there is no central body like a government or bank that oversees its distribution or use. Dryja and his team are working on systems that will make Bitcoin safer and easier for Bitcoin holders to use in the future. But as it stands he describes the digital currency as “dangerous.” “I guess the best analogy is that of gold: governments can regulate the institutions that deal with it but not the metal itself. They can’t decide if it’s going to weigh less or be purple instead of yellow. They will have to regulate what is regulate-able.” That’s why some think eventual regulation will burst the bubble. Kenneth Rogoff is a professor of public policy and economics at Harvard University and former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund. He thinks that there could be a broad international crackdown, and that even in countries like Japan or Australia which have gone to great lengths to legalise bitcoin, it won’t be further legitimised because governments cannot allow people to make big transactions in ways that can’t be traced. At the moment, he says governments are sitting back and letting Bitcoin foster technological innovation. But while Rogoff predicts that Bitcoin will struggle as more competitors emerge (Bitcoin may be “the MySpace of cryptocurrencies,” he says), the regulation issue is what will prove the ultimate challenge. “It’s just nonsense to think that we’ll reach a situation where everything is done in cryptocurrency and that no one pays taxes,” Rogoff says. He says in the currency game, “the government makes the rules and they can keep changing them until you can’t win. “The fundamental thing is that governments will pull the rug out at some point,” he says. “It will take some international coordination. I don’t think [Bitcoin] will be worthless – there may be some rogue states that support it.” But for now? The past week’s volatility could signal the “beginning of a really wild ride,” for Moas. Whether it soars or crashes though, one thing’s for certain, Dryja says: “There will be plenty of jobs for lawyers going forward.” To comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Capital, please head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.

Volatility,Will flying get more expensive?,2024-09-25,2020-05-29,John Walton,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200528-will-the-price-of-flights-increase-due-to-coronavirus,"Covid-19 has caused unprecedented turmoil in the aviation industry. What does that mean for pricing when planes take to the skies again? As more countries start to ease their Covid-19 lockdowns, attention is returning to the global aviation industry, almost entirely grounded for months. Some passenger airlines have kept skeleton fleets flying for repatriation missions, some have converted passenger jets to use as cargo planes, but all of them would much rather return to their primary objective: flying people safely around the world. But when planes do take to the skies again, how much impact will the pandemic have on what they charge? “We know airlines want to get planes back in the air and bums back on seats,” says Benjamin Cany from Amadeus, a technology company that provides IT services to the travel industry, including one of its principal booking systems. In the short-term at least, that would point to lower fares aimed at incentivising consumers. Yet look past the next few months and there are factors that could push fares up, from airline bankruptcies that could reduce both supply and competition, to reduced fleets caused by retiring aircraft early. And the great unknown is how quickly passengers will return to flying, with the general feeling in the industry that aviation won’t return to pre-pandemic numbers until 2022, 2023 or beyond.   Airlines, Cany says, usually look at past demand to forecast future trends. But there’s no precedent for the current circumstances. “What are airlines to do when the past data is radically different, or no longer relevant for future calculations?” The pricing equation Airline pricing, explains Cany, is normally based on a combination of scientific calculations and models. This, he says, “is about understanding the customer's motivation to travel and how much they are willing to pay for the ticket. Airlines then balance that against capacity, and a myriad other indicators. The airline wants to strike the best deal for the airline and the traveller.” This is both a science and an art. The science, Cany says, “is in the modelling, machine learning and algorithms behind this calculation” and would usually include “the choice between the different airline products (for example, business versus premium economy) and the various airline itineraries available (departure time, arrival time, trip duration). That needs to be combined with historical data, seasonality, as well as market indicators such as upcoming local events, competition on that same route, and so forth.” The art, meanwhile, comes from “the airline’s pricing and revenue management experts, who adjust these indicators to develop the most accurate forecast. That’s where the technology helps, providing these teams with the tools to improve the forecast accuracy to the highest degree,” Cany concludes. But nobody knows how the models that aviation has been honing for decades will change as a result of the extraordinary Covid-19 challenges, particularly given the situation is still evolving. When will demand return? In the most basic of economic terms, for example, airline fares are set based on a supply curve and a demand curve. Airlines usually have the lever of supply under their control, and it’s generally understood that when they want to stimulate demand to fill capacity, they reduce fares. More people will travel if a ticket is $50 than if it is $100. The X factor right now is that many people are scared to travel because of hygiene concerns, lockdown guidance and quarantine rules.  “Short-term, aircraft will continue to be much less full and airlines will be motivated to price seats to get customers flying safely in a Covid-19 world,” says Joe Leader, chief executive officer of APEX, a trade association whose members include airlines and their suppliers. “Airlines have cut back their flights to absolute connectivity minimums and are losing money on the vast majority of remaining flights… Hopefully, the combination of increased Covid-19 safety measures alongside low prices will encourage a travel rebound.” Paul Simmons, a senior airline executive with experience at numerous airlines worldwide including easyJet and Malaysia Airlines, suggests much will depend on what part low pricing can play as a tool to persuade people to travel. “It could be that airlines find their traditional lever of low pricing to drive bums on seats does not work as well as it used to. People may have higher concerns.” The general view is that domestic travel will recover first, a view with which Peter Foster, CEO of Kazakhstan’s national carrier Air Astana, agrees. “Initial indications from our recently-restarted limited domestic flights are that there is pent-up demand for these routes. We believe that business, worker and student travel will recover well before leisure travel.” IATA, an airline trade association, expects low demand when countries first start to travel again, despite some business travellers needing to fly and a desire for what’s known as VFR — visiting friends and relatives — traffic as people miss their families. On the plus side for airlines, IATA notes that the biggest variable cost in aviation, fuel, will be low: as drivers in many places are noticing, there’s oversupply in the petroleum industry keeping prices down. Will supply fall?  If there are major unknowns on the demand side, there are also evolving factors influencing pricing on the supply side. One of the starkest images for the airline industry has been the sight of line after line of jets parked on runways and put into storage at aircraft recycling ‘boneyards’. While older and less efficient planes will be retired, some of them years ahead of schedule, airline executive Paul Simmons points out that most of the planes taken out of fleets have been stored, not scrapped. “This is an important distinction,” he says. Joe Leader from airline association APEX suggests that “there will be more than enough supply even with all of the early aircraft retirements”. Certainly to start off with, demand will be low enough to be met by the aircraft that haven’t been retired. Airbus and Boeing have both announced cuts to the numbers of new aircraft they’re building every month, but as demand rises again, the aircraft manufacturers can increase production, airlines can extend the life of aircraft they’re using, or older aircraft can be brought back into use from storage. It’s already clear that the airline landscape, and indeed the names painted on the side of the aircraft, are likely to be forever changed. Some airlines have already filed for various forms of bankruptcy protection or indeed have simply gone under. This will, in many cases, lead to less competition – and the possibility of monopoly pricing, which tends not to favour consumers. Yet it’s likely that regulators will come down hard on airlines seen to profiteer, while other carriers will seek to jump into monopoly markets where that is possible, or new entrants will arise. For passengers, that’s likely to mean a fair amount of volatility in fares. “Although some airlines will inevitably go out of business, others will scale up to fill the void,” comments Simmons. “The ‘rightsizing’ of supply and demand may take time, however, leading to higher pricing in the medium term.” No easy answers The watchword for aviation, as for so many industries looking to rebound from Covid-19, is going to be uncertainty. New waves of infection, or treatment breakthroughs, would both influence the future path. So too will political and regulatory responses, as well as the wider global economic fallout that is being forecast. Demand, crucially, is not rising evenly; different government restrictions ­– especially quarantine periods on arrival for travellers from some nations – will have effects that are very complex to model, and will necessarily differ between nations or even within regions of the same nation. The US is an example of how perceptions and thus demand can vary across a nation. Scott DeAngelo, chief marketing officer of niche leisure carrier Allegiant Air, said on an earnings call that customer surveys revealed that “in the Midwest and Mid Atlantic, the Upper West, I got to tell you they don’t share the opinion that the evening news is putting out there” around travel. Pictures over the US Memorial Day holiday weekend have shown leisure destinations in some parts of the country packed with partygoers. It seems likely that travel resumption “bubbles” between neighbouring countries and regions with acceptably low infection rates (where “acceptably” will also vary) will continue, and while these may stimulate demand travellers will also not want to be caught overseas if restrictions return swiftly. The question of whether any travel insurance would cover Covid-19-related issues is also crucial. Airlines also need to start flying for people to start buying tickets even in a reduced demand scenario, and we are only just starting to see a very limited number of airlines resuming very limited schedules. That all makes predicting the effects of the interlocking factors upon which airline pricing is based challenging. The demand side of the curve is particularly tricky for long-haul pricing, says Air Astana CEO Peter Foster, who nevertheless expects that the stronger long-haul airlines are likely to try to kickstart demand with lower fares. Short-haul carriers, meanwhile, may benefit from low oil prices, reduced aircraft prices that enable counter-cyclical orders and lower salaries due to surplus aviation workers. “The prognosis may well be lower airfares on short/medium haul routes for at least 18 months to two years,” Foster expects. And while Covid-19 is unprecedented, he believes the past can offer indicators for future trends. “After every major crisis of the last 20 years – the Asian financial crisis of 1998, 9/11, the global financial crisis – low-cost airlines have emerged faster and stronger because suppressed demand combined with depressed consumer spending power has driven people to them,” he says. “I doubt 2020/21 will be any different.” Aviation journalist John Walton writes about airlines, aircraft and everything aeronautical.

Volatility,I still have Masters chance - Woods,2024-09-25,2015-04-09,BBC Sport,https://www.bbc.com/sport/golf/32245076,"Tiger Woods has not won a major since 2008 Tiger Woods believes he can win a 15th major this week despite trailing leader Jordan Spieth by nine shots after day one of the Masters at Augusta. The 39-year-old, who last won a major in 2008 and took a break from the sport to work on his game earlier this year ended his opening round one over par. ""I'm still in it. I'm only nine back. We have a long way to go,"" the four-time Masters champion said. ""I felt good out there. I hit the ball well enough to shoot three under par."" In a poll of 103 Tour professionals before the tournament, 68 stated Woods would not add to his haul of majors and the volatility of his bogey-birdie-par-bogey start through four holes offered little confidence. But despite one three-putt, he scrambled well around the greens to offer at least some response to scrutiny of his chipping prior to his 64-day break from competitive play. ""It's my strength again,"" said Woods, who won the last of his Masters titles in 2005. ""That's why I've busted my butt. That's why I took time off. That's why I hit thousands and thousands of shots to make sure that it's back to being my strength."" The winner of the tournament in 1997, 2001, 2002 and 2005 drove the ball 261 yards on average, below the 283 averaged by other players in the opening round.

""If I can hit a few iron shots closer and convert on a few of those opportunities, I'll be right there."" McIlroy has described Augusta National as a ""second shot golf course"" and though the Northern Irishman hit 13 of 14 accessible fairways in his opening round, he could not capitalise and made just three birdies. ""I just kept telling myself to be patient. It was a tricky day,"" added McIlroy. ""The wind was swirling a little bit. Pin positions were tough.""

Ernie Els, 24 years Spieth's senior and playing in his 20th Masters, has also yet to win a green jacket but kept pace with the young American for large parts of his round and said it was a ""fantastic feeling"" to end on five under.

Volatility,Uni staff 'shocked and scared' by budget cut plan,2024-09-25,2024-01-22,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-lincolnshire-68036604,"Funding cuts at the University of Lincoln would be devastating for staff, students and the city, a trade union said. The University and College Union (UCU) said it has been told the university aims to reduce budgets by 20%. Owen Clayton from the UCU said staff were ""shocked and quite scared"". The university said it was ""looking to take pragmatic steps to reduce our cost base"" but could not rule out redundancies. It has just over 2,000 staff members and about 18,000 students.   ""We've had bumper student numbers for about five years and the university finances, if you look at them from July, look quite good, so people were not expecting this,"" said Mr Clayton. ""A 20% cut to funding would have a huge impact. You obviously couldn't provide the same level of quality. You would have staff that were far more stressed and tired and that would impact on the experience the students were getting. ""I think some departments would struggle to stay open if the cuts were as large as has been suggested."" A university spokesperson confirmed the plan to reduce its budget by 20% next year, citing ""growing pressure from the continued freeze in the home undergraduate tuition fee, volatility in international student recruitment, additional pension costs, and high inflation"" as among the issues. ""Although our finances are sound, we need to act now to ensure the university remains financially sustainable into the future and can continue to fulfil our crucial civic mission,"" they added. ""We will do everything possible to achieve the necessary cost savings through normal staff turnover and by reducing non-pay budgets. But we cannot, at this stage, rule out the possibility of redundancies in some form. ""The university will be consulting with our trade unions and engaging with colleagues and students over the coming months as plans develop.""

Volatility,Gas supplier announces price rise,2024-09-25,2024-01-17,By Olivia Copeland,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-jersey-68006681,"The gas supplier for Jersey and Guernsey has announced prices will rise from 31 January. Islands Energy Group (IEG) said gas tariffs would increase by 8% in Guernsey and by 12% in Jersey. The changes mean the average household in Guernsey will pay £8.30 more every month, with households in Jersey paying £13.80 more. IEG's CEO Jo Cox said the company was ""fully aware of the challenges households are facing"". The firm plans to review the rises in six months. Ms Cox said the ""difficult decision"" was due to changes to costs of importing gas, high interest rates and a ""continued volatility"" in the market.

Volatility,Why Watford chaos theory is misplaced,2024-09-25,2017-10-24,Phil McNulty,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/41710640,"Marco Silva has lost only two Premier League games as Watford boss - against Manchester City and Chelsea Watford's ascent to the upper reaches of the Premier League may be regarded as an overnight success under the highly-rated Portuguese coach Marco Silva, but in reality it is a progression five years in the making. The Hornets have been portrayed as a monument to instability as a result of regular managerial changes since the Italian Pozzo family took control at Vicarage Road in June 2012. Since Sean Dyche left shortly after the arrival of the Pozzos, eight managers have taken charge, although the figure is put into context to a degree with Beppe Sannino leaving amid tension with players, Oscar Garcia resigning because of ill-health after only 27 days, and Billy McKinlay a short-term appointment before Slavisa Jokanovic's arrival. Watford chairman and CEO Scott Duxbury calls their upward curve in the Premier League ""the inconvenient truth"", because it is actually stability, rather than volatility, that is behind the club's development. Scott Duxbury has been with Watford since 2012, having previously worked at West Ham Watford's strategy has been to build a structure behind the scenes that they hope will help the incumbent coach to flourish but also cope with managerial change without dismantling the club's framework. The club's de factor owner Gino Pozzo heads up a three-man hierarchy with Duxbury and technical director Filippo Giraldi - and while Silva is now a hugely-admired part of that set-up, he is part of Watford's vision rather than vice versa. Duxbury told BBC Sport: ""We are the inconvenient truth in that we are a model of stability that allows coaches to perform to their highest level. This is because of the infrastructure we have actually built up over the last five years. ""I say the inconvenient truth, because the media likes to portray us as unstable because of the number of head coaches we have had, but if you look back we have provided an environment on and off the pitch that has allowed every coach to succeed."" Duxbury notes that Gianfranco Zola, the Pozzos' first appointment, took Watford to a Championship play-off final and Jokanovic won promotion to the Premier League. Quique Sanchez Flores and Walter Mazzarri secured that status before Silva's arrival.

Duxbury says: ""On the stability point, we take a view that the role of a coach, particularly at a middle-of-the-table club, is a short one. I think the lifespan is two years. They will either move on to bigger and better things or there will be problems and then you will look to move on and look in a different direction. ""If you take that pragmatic approach, and history suggests it is the right approach, then I think it is only common sense you build a stable environment around the club so that if a coach does move for whatever reason, success or failure, the actual club and infrastructure around it remains so you can transplant in another coach to continue the development. ""We have shown over the past five years that the model works and we are actually a stable football club. It is just a sensible use of resources. It stops a club being derailed if a coach moves on for whatever reason."" This video can not be played Marco Silva is a top manager, like Sir Alex Ferguson - Tom Cleverley Marco Silva's summer appointment was regarded as a coup for Watford, the 40-year-old Portuguese actually enhancing his reputation at Hull City despite their relegation from the Premier League. Silva's meticulous approach and tactical awareness has drawn comparisons with friend and fellow countryman Jose Mourinho, his fierce work ethic, intensity and attention to detail impressing those who brought him to Vicarage Road. And again, fixed firmly in Watford's strategy, is the determination to leave Silva to concentrate on his coaching strengths. ""We take away all the distractions,"" says Duxbury. ""Marco is a mirror and model for that stability. Take nothing away from Marco, what he is doing is superb - but what he is doing is coaching. ""The coach is an extremely important role but our view is to make sure that is all he has to concentrate on. We don't expect him to grow and develop the football club - that's what we do. He can concentrate on his core competency.""

Duxbury said: ""We have a clear idea of how we believe coaching should occur at this club. We have a strong work ethic. We don't give days off to players, other than a recovery day, during the season. ""We like high intensity training and it is that combination, together with strong man management, that came across very clearly in Marco's time at Hull City. ""That is what we will always be looking for, for that coach who can deliver that work ethic, that kind of professionalism we have been looking for. This is what Marco gives, together with the fact his squad management and man management is superb. ""Marco is an exceptional coach working at a very high level."" The impression of Watford as a ""hire 'em fire 'em"" club when it comes to employing managers is a theory the club is keen to debunk. After those early periods of turnover, Jokanovic lasted 35 league games - winning promotion before a contract dispute led to his departure - while Flores and Mazzarri each had one full Premier League season at Vicarage Road before moving on. Duxbury insists these changes are not the product of a trigger-happy boardroom but clear decision making, pointing in the direction of the multitude of mid-season - or even early-season - managerial changes elsewhere. This video can not be played Watford players find out about Premier League promotion He explained: ""If you look at our Premier League history we have never changed a coach during the season. We have completed every campaign with the same coach. I think that is testament to all parties at the football club and our evaluation process. ""We don't like making knee-jerk reactions or decisions because they are invariably wrong. ""At the end of the season we sit down, evaluate where we want to go and how we are going to get there. It has resulted in a discussion that has led to a change in coach because the ideology and where we want to go hasn't necessarily been aligned with that particular individual. ""Fortunately, it has always been our conscious decision and part of our strategic development rather than 'we're bottom of the league. We've lost five games. We have to make a change'. We've never been in that position."" Richarlison has scored three times for Watford since joining them in the summer Watford's fine start to the season has also put some shrewd summer recruitment in the spotlight, particularly the £11m purchase of Brazil under-20 international Richarlison from Fluminense and the £5.5m deal to sign Nathaniel Chalobah from Chelsea. Richarlison had a disappointing day at Stamford Bridge on Saturday but has impressed overall, while Chalobah's early form won him an England call-up before he sustained a knee injury. Pozzo, Duxbury and especially Giraldi lead Watford's worldwide scouting network. Giraldi, who revealed Watford have a list of ""10 players minimum per position"" on their recruitment list, was elevated from chief scout and enjoys what he calls the ""vertical structure"" of management, the lack of layers meaning deals can be done quickly. He once joked about Watford's web of scouts: ""It's like a spy story. I don't like to say their names or where they are based but I can tell you they cover everywhere."" Watford have a head of recruitment in South America who they are in daily contact with as they unearth talent such as the precocious Richarlison.

""We try to be clever,"" says Duxbury. ""We try to get our information quickly then move quickly. I think as each year goes by our reputation and standing is growing. ""We just move very quickly and efficiently out of all the targets for that particular position. Richarlison was the one we could close quickly so we took a view we would close what was closable rather than waiting and looking at other options."" Chalobah was prepared to leave Chelsea to move to Vicarage Road, a switch that surprised some given his growing reputation as a key component of England's under-21 side. Duxbury said: ""We are a growing, aspirational club ""It takes somebody of intelligence, drive and ambition to actually buy into that, to say I will leave the safe surroundings of one of the biggest clubs in Europe to come and play and be part of this process. ""It is really satisfying that he was rewarded almost immediately for that. He's played and has been selected for the England squad."" Nathaniel Chalobah has been a regular with England Under-21s Richarlison was on Watford's radar for 12 months before the deal was done, having also being linked with Chelsea, and Duxbury admits there was an element of a gamble about the move. ""He was always in that 'potential' category but all of us, including Marco, were prepared to take that gamble, spending that kind of money on a player we needed to perform immediately when there was no guarantee he would. ""I can't talk for other clubs, whether they were prepared to take that gamble or not, but we did and we moved quickly and decisively."" Deals are done in conjunction with the coach, but Duxbury says: ""To ask a coach to be responsible for scouting, recruiting, negotiating - I think it's just unworkable. ""We work with the coach. We take that burden away from him, allow him to focus on coaching while we bring in the players.  ""He will have been part of the process in identifying the players and we will always bring in players that he wants but the actual mechanics of it, the burden of it, is taken away from him."" Graham Taylor (left) led Watford from the Football League Fourth Division to the First Division in only five years from 1977 Watford, under the management of the late Graham Taylor and chairmanship of Sir Elton John, was a ""family"" club - and there is still more than a nod to the vintage era even under the modern regime. They both have stands named after them at Vicarage Road, while the rock star and Honorary Life President attends at least one home game a season, including the recent meeting with Manchester City. He is also in regular touch with the club hierarchy while a statue to Taylor has been commissioned with his family's blessing and will be unveiled towards the end of the season. The club's Community Trust also celebrates its 25th anniversary this season. Now Watford are hoping their ""inconvenient truth"" can gain wider acceptance and recognition.

Volatility,Tourism budget approved despite spending controls,2024-09-25,2024-01-23,By Nadia Lincoln & Kris Holland,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-northamptonshire-68069504,"A council has approved an £856,000 budget for its culture and tourism plans a week after it introduced spending controls. North Northamptonshire Council (NNC) recently introduced a panel to approve any expenditure above £500. But under the plans, thousands of pounds will be spent on attractions such as the Chester House Estate. At a meeting, a councillor for the Conservative-controlled authority said ""tourism generates economy"". Corby Heritage Centre, the Cornerstone in Kettering and the North Northamptonshire Greenway Project also stand to benefit from enhanced facilities from the proposed spend. At a meeting on 18 January, Jim Hakewill, an independent councillor, asked NNC's executive panel if it was ""acceptable"" to invest the funds into culture and tourism when there were ""so many other demands in our resources"".  Helen Howell, the council's executive member for sport, leisure, culture and tourism, said that the £850k figure was ""not a great deal of money"" in the context of the council's £371m budget for 2024-25. She said: ""It is quite disturbing that one should think we should not invest and spend any money in this sort of service - it provides an awful lot of things for an awful lot of people. ""[Tourism] generates income for this council, it generates income for everybody out there and creates jobs."" The meeting also heard that the NNC's projected overspend for this financial year has risen, with the council expecting an additional spend of £8.5m.  Lloyd Bunday, the council's executive member for finance and transformation, said that the rising costs were due to events ""beyond the realms of control"" of the council and the volatility of demand-led services. He also warned of a ""real risk"" of a further £3m of savings not being delivered by Northamptonshire Children's Trust. Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X. Got a story?

Volatility,University under 'growing' financial pressure,2024-09-25,2024-01-18,By David McKenna,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-lincolnshire-68024599,"The University of Lincoln says it is under ""growing"" financial pressure and must take steps to reduce costs. A spokesperson said it was due to a number of factors, including a freeze in tuition fees and high inflation. The university said it would do ""everything possible"" to achieve the necessary savings through normal staff turnover. However, officials said they could not rule out the possibility of redundancies ""in some form"". The university, which was recently awarded the highest national honour in UK further and higher education for its work on sustainability in the UK's food and farming industries, has about 18,000 students and just over 2,000 staff. In a statement, a spokesperson said: ""Like many UK universities, our finances are under growing pressure from the continued freeze in the home undergraduate tuition fee, volatility in international student recruitment, additional pension costs, and high inflation. ""Given this challenging external environment, with rising costs and declining real terms income, we are looking to take pragmatic steps to reduce our cost base. ""Although our finances are sound, we need to act now to ensure the university remains financially sustainable into the future. ""The university will be consulting with our trade unions and engaging with colleagues and students over the coming months as plans develop,"" the spokesperson added. In response, University and College Union (UCU) regional official Julie Cooper said it was shameful for management ""to in one breath state its finances are sound, yet in the next threaten job cuts"". ""Management needs to work with UCU as the recognised trade union to protect jobs. Redundancies must always be a last resort,"" she added.

Volatility,How can the government solve the energy crisis?,2024-09-25,2022-01-05,By Simon Jack,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-59883892,"Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng will chair a virtual meeting with the energy industry later on Wednesday to consider alternatives to tackle what energy providers and others are describing as a national crisis.  There are three fronts to this crisis: household consumers, business customers and the energy companies themselves.  The government has made clear its number one priority is domestic consumers, although that is arguably the least urgent of the three. Most consumers are protected by the continued existence of the energy price cap. It may have bankrupted two dozen providers, forced to buy wholesale gas at higher prices than they are allowed to sell it, but it means that millions of bills are capped at £1,277 for normal domestic usage.  That current level will remain in place until 1 April, but the new cap level will be announced in early February.  This is the deadline that government officials are working to when trying to figure out how to protect consumers, who will struggle to pay their bills when the cap rises by an estimated 50% or more.  The options include abolishing VAT of 5% on energy bills. This would be quick and easy, but is considered a blunt instrument, as it would provide support to well-off customers who don't need it. For those that do need it, 5% of a possible £700 price rise is pretty small.  The government could temporarily suspend the additional levies on bills that fund green policies. That would be a tricky sell in some quarters, after the UK hosted a major global climate summit, and these levies are designed to reduce dependence on volatile fossil fuels. This option is, however, gaining support among some Conservative backbench MPs.  One other option is to extend and expand the Warm Homes Discount. Currently, customers in receipt of certain benefits can apply for a one-off payment of £140.  That could be increased. When quizzed on Tuesday on what the government was considering, the prime minister reached for his energy briefing crib sheet and this was on the list.  Another option - suggested by the industry - would be to subsidise the energy companies themselves, by establishing a fund or facility which would allow them to draw down government cash when wholesale prices were very high and then pay it back when prices dipped again.  This would smooth out price spikes and would have the added benefit, energy providers argue, of preventing further providers going bust.  Even those that have survived so far have warned that their ability to insure themselves by buying the gas they need in advance is beginning to unravel, as higher prices are outlasting their advance orders and exhausting their day-to-day cash.  Officials seem cool on this idea at the moment. Any such fund would need Treasury approval and no concrete proposal has yet made it to the chancellor's desk.  Potentially, the most urgent problem is the needs of businesses who use a lot of energy and are not protected by any cap.  There were dread warnings from those firms before Christmas that many would imminently go bust, but government sources point out that so far, Armageddon has not materialised.  Government officials also point to the extreme volatility of wholesale prices. On Christmas Eve, prices hit 450p a unit - nine times the level last year. On Tuesday they were back to 150p.  It is hard and expensive to design a mechanism to accommodate wild swings which are affecting energy markets and their customers everywhere - not just in the UK.  Expectations of any breakthrough on Wednesday have been played down by people close to Mr Kwarteng.  "
Volatility,Crypto lender Genesis files for bankruptcy,2024-09-25,2023-01-20,By Shiona McCallum & Mike Farrell,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-64343377,"Cryptocurrency lender Genesis has filed for bankruptcy. The firm had recently been charged by US regulators Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) with illegally selling crypto. It is part of the Digital Currency Group (DCG), a conglomerate of more than 200 crypto-focused businesses. The insolvency of Genesis is linked to the bankruptcy of FTX, which went under last November amid allegations of fraud. Genesis had originally been set up as an ""over the counter"" Bitcoin trading desk, enabling the trade of large amounts of crypto. Earlier this month, it announced it was laying off 30% of its staff, taking it down to 145 employees. ""We look forward to advancing our dialogue with DCG and our creditors' advisers as we seek to implement a path to maximise value and provide the best opportunity for our business to emerge well-positioned for the future,"" Genesis interim chief executive Derar Islim said in a statement. Genesis had been hit by the collapse of another crypto firm, Three Arrows Capital, which went bankrupt in June last year. It said it was owed $1.2bn (£971m) by Three Arrows, which had been brought down by the collapse of cryptocurrencies Luna and TerraUSD in May. It is the latest in a series of shocks to the sector, which has been dubbed the ""crypto winter"" by some analysts, describing the plummet in value of cryptocurrencies. Genesis is also embroiled in a high-profile dispute with Gemini, owned by the former Olympic rowers Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, over the fate of $900m in assets that Gemini customers deposited with the lender. The product, called Gemini Earn, was sold to investors as a chance to earn as much as 7.4% interest on their cryptocurrency holdings. Some 340,000 Earn users have been unable to access their funds since November, when Genesis halted withdrawals because of the volatility in the crypto markets. Last week the SEC accused both Genesis and Gemini of illegally selling crypto assets to investors. The Winklevoss twins said they were looking forward to defending the action, but DCG has so far not commented. Cameron Winklevoss tweeted shortly after Genesis filed for bankruptcy.  The bankruptcy filing is another blow as the effects of FTX collapse are still being felt. Founder Sam Bankman-Fried is accused of fraud after diverting funds deposited by millions of customers on his FTX platform, and transferring them without authorisation to Alameda, a hedge fund. In December, the 30-year-old was extradited from the Bahamas, where FTX was based, back to the US where he formally pleaded not guilty to charges of defrauding customers and investors.  He was released on $250m bail, denying the allegations."

Volatility,Asia markets drop sharply after US falls,2024-09-25,2018-02-09,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42998819,"Major Asian markets suffered sharp losses on Friday, following another day of steep falls on Wall Street. In a volatile week for global investors, Japan's Nikkei 225 index slid 2.3%, while China's Shanghai Composite slumped by 4.1%.  Earlier, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by more than 1,000 points for the second time this week. Sell-offs around the world have been pinned partly on concerns over higher interest rates. Elsewhere in Asia on Friday, Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 3.1%, while South Korea's Kospi index traded down 1.8% and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 eased 0.9%. Those losses came as little surprise, with moves in major US markets providing the cue for global investors.  On Thursday, the Dow Jones ended 4.2% lower at 23,860, the S&P 500 closed down 3.8%, while the Nasdaq sank 3.9%. European exchanges also headed south on Thursday.  China was the worst performer in Asia on Friday as losses deepened from declines seen earlier this week.  Chinese stock markets tend to be volatile and are dominated by retail investors, rather than big institutions like many other major markets.  But falls in China can spark nervousness around the world over sentiment in the world's second largest economy.  As well as the broader sell-off, analysts said stocks in China were weighed down by people selling ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday. This is a common trend as the need for cash grows during this period - a time when Chinese companies typically pay bonuses and people also traditionally exchange cash and gifts during the period. This global sell-off began last week after a solid US jobs report fuelled expectations that the Federal Reserve would need to raise interest rates faster than expected because of the strength of the economy. That concern has prompted the pull-back from stocks.  On Thursday, the Bank of England seemed to offer support for the view that rates are on the up. The Bank left interest rates at 0.5% at its meeting, but said a strengthening economy meant interest rates were likely to rise sooner than the markets were expecting. Also worrying investors was a government budget proposal announced by US lawmakers, which raises spending caps and could fan inflation.  Bond yields in the US have also risen in recent weeks, typically a signal of higher rates. Higher interest rates push up borrowing costs for companies and individuals, which can hurt corporate profits and curb economic activity. At the same time, higher interest rates can make investment alternatives to stocks, such as bonds, more attractive. The uptick in volatility comes as investors react to the shifting conditions. And more turbulence could be on the way.  ""The return of volatility after two relatively calm days supports the idea there are further losses to come in the days and weeks ahead,"" said CMC Markets analyst Michael McCarthy.  The chaotic week on global markets also comes as several markets around the world sit on, or near record highs.  Analysts have said for months that financial markets were due a correction, after a long period of rising prices. Thursday's declines mean the Dow and S&P 500 have now fallen by more than 10% from the record highs set in January, a threshold analysts call a correction. Fidelity International's chief investment officer for Japan, Takashi Maruyama, said the ""massive volatility"" was a reaction to the rapid rise on the Japanese market since last year.  He added the sell-off presented a opportunity to buy shares at more ""reasonable"" prices. "
Volatility,Manx Gas rebrand 'reflects future diversification',2024-09-25,2022-09-05,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-isle-of-man-62797887,"A rebranding of Manx Gas reflects the future diversification of the firm's services, the company's managing director has said. Aidan Baglow said the name change to Isle of Man Energy reflected a change in direction to include alternatives to natural gas. He said it also showed support for the island's move to net-zero emissions. It follows a 43.9% price hike for customers due to global volatility in the wholesale gas market. Mr Baglow said the current energy crisis meant customers were seeking ""ways to use energy more efficiently"", leading to the company ""investing locally to provide additional products"". ""In the longer term, this means we will be diversifying our services and looking at alternatives to natural gas, such as biogas and green hydrogen,"" he added. The cost of the rebrand has not been confirmed but the company has invested in a new billing system and a new website, which will soon allow customers to see how much gas they are using. Acknowledging the rebrand comes at a difficult time for gas customers on the Isle of Man, CEO of parent company Islands Energy Group Jo Cox said the firm wanted to support ""energy transition"" or moves towards greener energy. Although change ""won't be quick or easy"", the company needed to ""evolve how we're doing things and what we offer"", she said. ""Some may question the need to transform our business now, but it is actually because of the crisis that business transformation is so critical,"" she added.

Volatility,Bitcoin sets fresh records after Musk investment,2024-09-25,2021-02-09,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-55984393,"Bitcoin has hit record highs for a second day after Elon Musk's car company Tesla said it had bought about $1.5bn (£1.1bn) of the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin rose above $48,000 (£34,820) before falling back, but it remains about 25% higher than a week ago. Some investors took Tesla's move as a signal that Bitcoin would become a mainstream financial asset. However, there was some criticism about a green car firm investing in such an energy intensive currency. Bitcoin currently uses more energy than Argentina every year, according to analysis from the University of Cambridge. Production of the cryptocurrency, known as ""Bitcoin mining"", needs energy-hungry computer hardware and ever-greater amounts of processing power. Mike Butcher, an editor at news website Techcrunch, tweeted: ""Tesla: Sells carbon credits to buy Bitcoin, which requires as much energy (not always Green energy) as a small country to mine."" Bitcoin is a form of digital money. This means it doesn't have a physical form. Instead, units of digital currency are traded over a computer network. It operates over a global network with thousands upon thousands of nodes - a machine within a network like a computer or some other device - which together process and store transactions. Explaining its investment on Monday, Tesla said that it wanted to maximise returns on cash lying dormant in the company's accounts. It also expects to accept payment for its electric cars in Bitcoin in future.  The moves sparked market interest which carried on into Tuesday. Shares of companies that provide trading platforms for Bitcoin and the technology to mine the cryptocurrency have surged in China, South Korea and Australia, and big computer chip-making firms such as SK Hynix also rose. The cryptocurrency has already risen in value by 62% this year, on top of a 300% rally in 2020, as investors search for alternative assets at a time when interest rates in many countries are at record lows. Bitcoin has had some interest from big investment firms, including Blackrock, which recently changed a handful of investment mandates to allow some of its funds to invest in the currency. However, central banks remain sceptical about the cryptocurrency. In October, Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey cautioned over Bitcoin's use as a payment method, saying it lacked ""intrinsic value"" unlike cash or gold.  Some institutional investors are also wary of the price volatility of Bitcoin. Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth, said: ""The average institutional investor is shaking their head. ""For these folks who are believers in cryptocurrency, [Tesla's investment] gives them another layer of support that crypto is the future."" But Bitcoin scepticism does not mean that central banks and regulators are against digital currencies per se. In China in particular regulators are starting to embrace issuing their own digital currencies for everyday use."
Volatility,Lovesick? These books can help,2024-09-25,2015-03-27,Hephzibah Anderson,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20150327-lovesick-books-that-will-help,"Literary agony aunt Hephzibah Anderson tackles the topic of love in its multiple forms. She recommends a selection of books to soothe readers’ tortured souls. Dear Textual Healing, Unrequited love is not the only issue that 10th grade girls like me go through, though it is pertinent. I am an avid reader with a love for modern teen fiction as well as 17th, 18th, and 19th-Century historical fiction; particularly drama at royal court. I have close friends, and quite an obsession for a certain 12th grade boy who barely notices me. Please recommend some literature that I would enjoy... I have ravaged the nearest libraries and run out of iTunes money for iBooks. Thank you, Sarah Dear Sarah, Unrequited love isn’t all that writers fret about either, but it does happen to be the driving theme – and inspiration – behind a great many of their most enduring works. Just think about it: Cyrano de Bergerac yearns for Roxanne, loyal Biddy pines for Pip in Great Expectations, and as for the eponymous hero of Goethe’s semi-autobiographical The Sorrows of Young Werther, so lovesick was he for the already engaged Lotte that he became a model for overwrought young men across 18th Century Europe. They even began dressing like him. You sound a voracious enough reader to have already discovered plenty of these lovelorn literary characters for yourself; my point is that when it comes to drama, there’s nothing quite like unrequited love. The most intense of all love’s varieties, it’s torturous and yet oddly pure, too. You never get close enough to that icy beauty or 12th grade boy to discover their disillusioning flaws – that they’re really very self-absorbed, or don’t share your enthusiasm for good books. Unrequited love is idealised love; it will by definition never be subjected to the strains of ho-hum reality. When love is reciprocated in literature, it’s often followed by the words ‘the end’. As bookworms then, we’re primed to experience just the kind of crush that seems to have seized you. Where am I going with this? Well, my initial advice might sound odd. Your friends will already have told you – quite accurately, I promise – that your crush’s failure to notice you is his loss, and other than being fully yourself, I don’t think there’s anything extra that you should be doing to catch his eye. But I suspect from those literary favourites you mention that you appreciate drama, so I’m going to suggest you try, if you possibly can, to enjoy your infatuation for what it is. There’ll be plenty of time later for other, more practical kinds of love. And besides, you’re following in a distinguished literary tradition. WB Yeats is only one author to have spun literary gold from his devotion to a determinedly platonic friend (her name was Maud Gonne). Because novels can raise our expectations of love – sometimes fatally, just think of romance-addict Emma Bovary – I recommend Katherine Heiny’s new short story collection, Single, Carefree, Mellow, which brings love down to earth with a wry bump. Even its depictions of illicit, extramarital amour are anchored in the domestic. There’s one particular story, How to Give the Wrong Impression, which is told in the second person singular and describes a girl who’s in love with her roommate, Boris. Boris loves her back just not like that, as he’s forever demonstrating. For instance, at Christmastime he presents her with a framed poster of the four major food groups. “You amuse yourself by trying to think of one single more unromantic gift he could have given you,” our narrator sighs. You should also reach for philosopher Alain de Botton’s pocket-sized modern classic On Love. A charming first novel, it charts the course of a romance from the couple’s meet-cute – aboard a Paris to London flight, no less – to his hatred of her taste in shoes and her eventual drift away. As primers on the dos and don’ts of courtship go, this one’s a treat and only mildly neurotic. Finally, to stop you becoming too cynical too young (save Dorothy Parker for college), two great novels to keep you believing in romance while you wait for your would-be paramours to grow up. Rose Tremain’s Music and Silence is set in Copenhagen in the 17th Century, where love leads an angelic-looking lutenist into the thick of deadly dynamics at the royal court. AS Byatt’s Possession, meanwhile, twins the mystery of a forgotten romance between two Victorian authors with a stuttering, modern-day relationship that springs up between two rival literary critics and accidental sleuths. So fixated are they on their reading, they almost fail to notice one another. Dear Textual Healing, I divorced three years ago after being married for 24 years. My early life with my ex was one of the best times of my life but my marriage turned awful after we had kids. I stuck it out until the kids came out of high school, thinking things might get better and not wanting the kids to grow up in a broken home.  I’ve been very happy since the divorce.     A year into my single life I met an amazing woman and fell in love. But I did not trust the feeling. In fact it felt damned uncomfortable. She was someone I thought I could spend the rest of my life with but I did not trust the feeling, and could not until enough years would have passed that I could be confident that I know who she really is. She was not willing to go so slow. We broke up. How do I become able to trust love again B Dear B, The surprise here is that you came as close as you did to committing to another serious relationship so soon after your divorce. But while the passage of years can heal emotional wounds, literature is full of cautions about time’s limitations in terms of helping us truly know the objects of our affections. Gillian Flynn’s Gone Girl has spawned an entire mini-genre of books turning on the idea that you can share a life with another person without ever truly knowing what they’re capable of. Alison Lurie’s Truth and Consequences presents a less sensationalistic portrait of that same predicament. Jane and Alan Mackenzie are the perfect couple – he a middle-aged architecture professor, she a younger college administrator. Within their marriage, they’ve each taken on distinct roles, he as the charming star, she his eager acolyte. That all changes when, showing off to junior colleagues on the volleyball court, Alan injures his back. Flat out on the couch, he’s utterly dependent on Jane. In alternating chapters, the novel toggles between her point of view and his to chart their subsequent marital breakdown, nudged along by the arrival of a new couple on campus. Rather than discouraging you, this should make you feel better about the failure of your own marriage. People change over time, and there’s no bigger catalyst for that than parenthood and its accompanying challenges. Unfortunately, this does also mean that if you’re looking to thoroughly protect yourself from future hurt, you’re going to be spending a lot of time on the sidelines of your own life. No character better exemplifies the pitfalls of that approach than Macon Leary, The Accidental Tourist – and hero – of Anne Tyler’s 1985 novel. Macon has suffered terribly and when his woes are compounded by his wife’s decision to move out, he withdraws further from the world, writing travel guides for people who dislike travel and insulating himself with careful routines. Into this scenario dog-trainer Muriel explodes like a grenade. Ultimately, Macon will be forced to choose between familiarity and the volatility of messy, disruptive, glorious passion. Along similar lines, Julian Barnes’ Man Booker-winner, The Sense of an Ending is an elegant, twist-filled cautionary tale of, among other things, a man who plays it too safe and risks too little. Unhappiness can become a habit and it takes courage to let yourself be otherwise, as Alain de Botton’s protagonist (see above) discovers when he’s beset by ‘anhedonia’ – the terror arising from the threat of complete happiness. To help navigate this, I’m prescribing Brené Brown’s Daring Greatly, the book that sprang from her cult TED talk. Making yourself vulnerable, she insists again and again, is part of the deal – until you’re able to do that, you won’t know love’s greatest rewards. That you’re wary of love is understandable; that you haven’t fallen out of love with it is to be celebrated, and what better way than to let yourself fall? If you still need encouragement to seize the day, look no further than David Nicholls’ One Day, whose protagonists – he more consistently than she – take far longer than anyone reasonably should to realise that they belong together. These books can’t persuade you that loving is ever without risk but they should help you have confidence in your feelings and the courage to see what kind of a future they might lead to. As Tennyson would tell you, ‘’Tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all’. Then again he would say that, being a poet.   Send an email to textualhealing@bbc.com describing a problem in your life that you need some help with.

Volatility,The underrated genius of Bowie's acting,2024-09-25,2022-01-06,Rachel Pronger,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20220105-the-underrated-genius-of-david-bowies-acting,"As we approach the 75th anniversary of Bowie's birth, we explore his unpredictable film roles. Every part he played was 'in conversation with his many alter egos', argues Rachel Pronger. One of the many pioneering elements of David Bowie's career was his commitment to the visual. For Bowie, sound and vision went hand in hand. His many star personas – Ziggy Stardust, Aladdin Sane, Major Tom – each came with their own fully realised aesthetic worlds, costumes, make-up and artwork that were as instantly recognisable as the music itself. Long before the advent of MTV, Bowie was making short films to promote his music, and he would go on to push the boundaries of the form with iconic videos such as Ashes to Ashes. Indeed, Bowie's final gift to the world came in filmic form – the video for his last single Lazarus was released on 7 January 2016, just three days before his death. More like this: -          The cult 90s film that blazed a trail -          Stories that reflect our oldest fear -          The photos that made Bowie an icon It's unsurprising that this most mercurial of artists, with his visual sensibility and many alter-egos, would be drawn to film. Yet, while Bowie's legendary status in music is beyond question, quantifying his contribution to cinema as an actor is more complicated. In the three decades between The Man Who Fell to Earth (1976) and The Prestige (2006), Bowie appeared in dozens of films but – despite that span of credits – only a few of these roles came close to making the most of his talent. When we leave aside the many cameos – of which the uncontested crème de le crème is Bowie solemnly adjudicating a runway walk-off in Zoolander – and the forgettable flops – the less said about Just a Gigolo, the better – we are left with only a handful of performances. Yet those acting roles that did manage to effectively exploit Bowie's gifts are easily enough to secure his status as a cinema icon. When matched with an inventive director, Bowie could be an unforgettable screen presence.   From the start of his career, Bowie was an artist who often turned to cinema for inspiration. Whether referencing Stanley Kubrick on Space Oddity, posing like Greta Garbo on the cover of Hunky Dory or channelling German expressionism as the Thin White Duke, Bowie was constantly drawing on film iconography in his music. Filmmakers quickly identified his potential as a subject, with documentaries such as DA Pennebaker's Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1979) and Alan Yentob's Cracked Actor (1975) capturing spectacular live performances and intimate behind-the-scenes footage. Cracked Actor depicts Bowie at the height of his 1970s fame, rattled by cocaine, and driven to the brink of sanity by the pressures of stardom. It was this image of a strung-out Bowie driving around LA in the back of a limousine that inspired Nicolas Roeg to cast the musician in his first major film role. The Man Who Fell to Earth is the story of Thomas Newton, an alien on a rescue mission from his home planet who crash-lands on Earth and ends up stranded in the New Mexico desert. Disguised as a human, Newton attempts to raise money for a new spaceship by selling alien technologies but soon becomes corrupted by human vices.   By 1975, Roeg had already established his reputation with arthouse landmarks such as Walkabout and Don't Look Now. The Man Who Fell to Earth brought together one of the most interesting directors of the 1970s with the decade's defining popstar, and the result is a trippy triumph. Like Bowie's music, the film mashes up genres – sci-fi, political thriller, romance – and channels the counter-cultural mood of the time to create something bracingly new. With a fragmented, often confusing narrative, it's a genuinely risky film that feels as if it could crash land at any moment, but which is held together by a magnetic central performance. Without Bowie, The Man Who Fell to Earth would be an intriguing curio; with him, it becomes a classic.   Part of Bowie's power lies in his astonishing physical presence. Pale and emaciated, with streaks of red hair falling into mismatched eyes, Bowie requires little make-up to convince as an alien in disguise. A series of retro costumes – wide fedoras, loose high-waisted trousers, tight white T-shirts – draw out his androgynous beauty and emphasise Newton's genderless nature. That blurring of gender boundaries is reflected too in Bowie's frail physicality and delicate movements. Bowie's Newton moves initially with the faltering steps of someone learning to walk again. When he collapses in a hotel lift, chambermaid and future lover Cindy Lou (Candy Clarke) scoops him into her arms, and carries him to bed as if he weighs nothing at all. But there is more to this performance than a dazzling surface. In the throes of his addiction, Bowie was in a fragile mental state during the shoot, and his sense of dissociation is perhaps part of what makes him so frighteningly credible as a stranded alien. At times, as Bowie oscillates between sweet helplessness and terrifying volatility, it feels more like a possession than a performance. Scenes in which Newton succumbs to addiction, sitting before a wall of wailing televisions or stirring his drinks with a gun, crackle with manic energy. The final image of Newton slumped in his seat, just another drunk with nowhere to go, is devastating. By casting Bowie, Roeg encourages us to blur the boundaries between character and performer, and in doing so draws out new layers of meaning. Newton, adrift in cowboy country with a London accent and British papers, is an alien in several senses. It's possible to read the film as a straight sci-fi, but also as a metaphor for the outsider status of the immigrant, for the loneliness of genius or for the isolation of celebrity. Much of Bowie's art feels like it comes from another planet but, as his tender performance demonstrates, to be exceptional can be alienating.   In The Man Who Fell to Earth, Roeg set the template that would define Bowie's film career. All of his most successful screen performances share certain hallmarks – an unusually imaginative director, a role as an exceptional outsider, a blurring between star persona and character. Music critics tend to praise Bowie's chameleonic quality, his ability to switch from extra-terrestrial rock to blue-eyed soul to polished pop in the blink of an eye. Yet as an actor, Bowie was no chameleon – instead of disappearing into his roles, he floated above them, always a level removed. This distance meant that every part Bowie played was inevitably in conversation with his many alter egos, and with the nature of fame itself. Reality and performance Bowie's most effective performances tap into that meta-commentary. An example of this is his brief but memorable appearance as Andy Warhol in Julian Schnabel's biopic Basquiat (1996). Based on Schnabel's friendship with the artist Jean-Michel Basquiat, the film is full of characters modelled on real people from the 1980s New York art scene. In real life, Warhol was a hero of Bowie's – there's a song dedicated to him on Hunky Dory – and the two had crossed paths at parties. By casting Bowie, Schnabel has one legendary artist disguise themselves as another, and in doing so taps into the same ideas about fame that defined Warhol's art. Bowie delivers a delightfully ironic turn, peering out from beneath a silver shock wig (taken from Warhol's real-life wig collection), his lip curled in constant amusement. In a film that sometimes takes itself too seriously, Bowie delivers a dose of wry camp, playfully exposing the shallow nature of artworld celebrity and once again blurring the boundaries between reality and performance. On a similar wavelength, but even better, is Bowie's supporting role as the inventor Nikola Tesla in Christopher Nolan's tricksy period thriller The Prestige (2006). Tesla was another famous maverick, a Serbian-born pioneer of electronic engineering who died in 1943 after a troubled but influential life. In Bowie's interpretation, Tesla becomes a kind of real-life twin to Thomas Newton, a displaced genius who teases the boundary between magic and science – and is ultimately destroyed by the greed of those who surround him. Like Newton, Bowie's Tesla arrives with a bang, appearing apparently from nowhere in a cloud of sparks. Bowie's occasionally extravagant performance – all lustrous moustache and lilting, indeterminate accent – is tempered by a core of vulnerability that grounds this archetypal mad scientist in poignant reality. The same otherworldly quality that makes Bowie's takes on Warhol and Tesla so successful, is also used to beguiling effect in two 1980s cult classics. Jim Henson's fantasy Labyrinth (1986) was a commercial disappointment on first release but has since become a cult favourite. Bowie's justifiably much-loved performance as the Goblin King is key to the film's appeal. Resplendent in bejewelled blouses, outrageously tight trousers and a shocking wig that tops even Warhol's, Bowie relishes the opportunity to play the villain. On his own terms, Henson was himself something of a genius, and like Roeg he delivers a series of memorable images that capitalise on his star's incandescent charisma. Bowie's Jareth fizzes with mischievous magic, as he materialises like a shimmering apparition in an open window or strides upside-down across rotating Escher-indebted stairways. Tony Scott's uneven The Hunger (1983) is less satisfying overall but does offer the tantalising prospect of Bowie as one half of a stylish vampire couple alongside Catherine Deneuve. The Hunger came out immediately after the release of Bowie's phenomenally successful Let’s Dance album, and the role offers a goth twist on his slickly handsome 80s pop persona. Bowie's creature of the night is exquisitely stylish and devastatingly sexy, prowling blue-lit Manhattan nightclubs in sunglasses searching for his next fix. The film is worth watching for Bowie's elegantly unhinged performance and for its moments of delirious excess, such as an exhilarating opening sequence in which Bowie and Deneuve procure a couple of hipsters for dinner to an unsettling Bauhaus soundtrack. In the same year that Bowie went full goth in The Hunger, he also delivered one of his most substantial and grounded performances. In Nagisa Ōshima's Merry Christmas, Mr Lawrence (1983), Bowie stars as Major Celliers, a soldier serving in Java during World War Two, who is captured and sent to a brutal Japanese prison camp. In confinement, Celliers becomes a leadership figure for his fellow prisoners and an object of obsession for the camp's commander Captain Yonoi (Ryuichi Sakamoto). In many ways, this is Bowie's straightest performance. Tanned and movie-star handsome, aside from his endearingly crooked British teeth, Bowie's Celliers initially embodies dignified masculine power. Yet, as is always the case with his best performances, Bowie brings to the surface a subversive subtext, drawing out the queerness that lies beneath many war-movie tropes. As the film progresses, Celliers infuriates his captors with increasingly transgressive acts of rebellion, showing his contempt for authority through flamboyant performances, singing songs, collecting flowers and even by kissing Yonoi. By casting Bowie alongside fellow musician Sakamoto (a legendary popstar in his own right), Ōshima presents us with a face-off between two titans of 20th-Century music. The homoerotic tension between the pair culminates in an ambiguous moment when, having sentenced Celliers to be buried alive, Yanoi visits the condemned man to cut a lock of his hair, like a fan or a lover would. The film's climactic image of Celliers buried neck-deep in the sand, his hair bleached by the blazing sun, is an arresting tableau fit for an album cover. In the aftermath of the star's death, such indelible images have gained new significance. Bowie's death robbed us of future music, but it also took away the possibility of more film roles, of more opportunities for this most unusual of artists to enchant and surprise us at the cinema. Not all of Bowie's roles were worthy of his talent, but those that were have at least left us with some kind of compensation. The Starman may be gone, but some element of his extraordinary charisma will always remain, a glittering after-image burned forever on to the silver screen.   Bowie: Starman and the Silver Screen is at BFI Southbank, London, until the end of January, with select films available to stream on BFI Player.

Volatility,How climate change will transform work,2024-09-25,2017-07-10,Amanda Ruggeri,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20170705-how-climate-change-could-transform-the-work-force,"Our planet is already feeling the effects of climate change, but it’s also poised to cause irreversible shifts in the ways we work, and the skills that employers need. When we think of climate change, most of us think of environmental consequences like rising sea levels, elevated temperatures and melting glaciers. In some parts of the world, like south Florida or the mountains of Switzerland, those shifts already are affecting daily life. In Miami, for example, wastewater treatment plants are being re-built higher, seawalls raised and car parks designed with flood gates – not only in response to flooding today, but with an eye to the sea levels of tomorrow. But experts say that those effects may only be the tip of the (melting) iceberg. Climate change is shaking up everything from finance to health. As a result, it isn’t only urban planners in at-risk areas who will have to shift their framework for planning for the future. From financial planners to farmers, civil engineers to doctors, an increasingly wide range of other professionals are likely to find their industries affected. That means there may be another consequence of climate change that often gets overlooked: what it means for your career. “Everyone is going to need to understand [climate change] the same way you’d assume everyone in business needs to have some fluency in social media today, or that everyone would able to use a computer 20 years ago,” says Andrew Winston, author of the book The Big Pivot: Radically Practical Strategies for a Hotter, Scarcer, and More Open World. Because it is difficult to know exactly how dramatic the effects of climate change will be, it is hard to know just how much it will affect various industries. But some of the changes already are being seen. Climate-related disasters like droughts and hurricanes, for example, are hitting pocketbooks and insurance premiums – even for people living on the other side of the world. Meanwhile, the complicated supply chains of a globalised retail industry mean that a disruption in one place can cause consequences elsewhere. That was shown recently when earthquakes hit Japan in April 2016, damaging plants that sold parts to Toyota and forcing the auto giant to suspend production. Even the health industry may be affected. As well as affecting the availability of clean water and food, warmer weather is increasing the vulnerability of areas already at risk of diseases like malaria and dengue. The recent Zika epidemic may have been exacerbated by warmer weather patterns. Between 2030 and 2050, the World Health Organisation predicts that climate change will cause roughly 250,000 additional deaths per year. “One of the most interesting things that hasn’t been talked a lot about, but that there’s a lot of work on in WHO and NIH, is what’s coming at us in terms of disease, and how the weather is changing and spreading diseases and epidemics faster,” says Michelle DePass, dean of the Milano School of International Affairs, Management, and Urban Policy at the New School in New York. “We might listen to the BBC to hear all about Ebola and other things, and not quite grasp that we are very, very vulnerable to [these kinds of epidemics] here in the United States, as well, because of what’s happening with climate.” In fact, this year, the World Economic Forum’s Global Risks Report, which draws on assessments from 750 experts, found that one of the five biggest risks faced by the world in 2017, in terms of potential impact, is weapons of mass destruction. All of the four others are climate-related: extreme weather events, water crises, major natural disasters, and failure of climate-change mitigation and adaptation. Despite the size of the challenge, fewer employees are trained in incorporating climate patterns in their planning for the future than should be, says Daniel Kreeger, executive director of the nonprofit Association of Climate Change Officers. (One of ACCO’s initiatives is to run training and credentialing programmes in climate-related skills). “We don’t have the right people with the right skills in the right places,” he says. He points to one example: civil engineering. “We don’t expect to get monster inundations of rain, and then drought for six months. We expect to get periodic, smaller amounts of rain. So our systems aren’t equipped to deal with larger rainfalls,” Kreeger says. “When those parameters change, you need a workforce to deal with those changes. “Well, our civil engineers haven’t been trained to deal with climate change in their training. Our urban planners, our city managers, our architects. Nobody’s been taught this stuff.” Hiring climate  Right now, the top 10 most-desired skills for getting hired, according to LinkedIn’s data analysis, all have to do with tech: think cloud computing, SEO marketing and web architecture. In the same way tech has transformed today’s workforce, some say that climate change could transform tomorrow’s.   One industry that already shows some of that evolution is energy. According to data provided by job listings search engine Indeed, in the first quarter of 2014 in the UK, job postings in the renewable energy sector – made up of bioenergy, geothermal, hydroelectric, solar, and wind – accounted for a third (32.9%) of all energy-sector job postings in the first quarter of 2014. In 2017, that had risen to over half of all energy sector job postings, or 51.5%. Although these numbers are UK-specific, the same pattern of a shift to renewables was seen worldwide, says Tara Sinclair, Indeed’s senior fellow and an economist at George Washington University. Those changes have been the result of a variety of factors, including the fall in oil prices and competitiveness of natural gas: over the same three years, job postings for oil and coal in the UK fell from two-thirds (66.5%) of the energy sector to under half (47.7%). But it’s also a result of how both employers and job-seekers are becoming interested in mitigating emissions and climate change, says Sinclair. After oil prices declined several years ago, she says, jobs in the oil industry dropped off, as did job-seekers’ interest in them. “Part of it is there are fewer opportunities, and people respond to that they know what the landscape of the labour market is, broadly,” she says. “But also there does seem to be this increasing attractiveness of green economy jobs.” In the same way that many people from the oil and gas industry have been able to transition into green energy, says Sinclair, many employees already should have skills which are transferable to climate change-specific issues. Take production and supply chains. “Generally, planning production differently around potentially volatile weather phenomena, etc, is going to be a piece of the skill set you’d be required to have”, Sinclair says. “But I don’t see that that’s so much different than planning around other sorts of destructive phenomena, whether they be political or anything else. I don’t think that as new skill we haven’t seen before.” Money talks It remains to be seen how much climate change will affect the expected skill sets for employees in industries less immediately affected by climate change than, say, civil engineering or catastrophe bonds. But even companies in industries that would appear to be less directly affected by climate change are tuning into the issue. Winston, who consults with a variety of businesses to help them get ahead of global trends – one of which is climate change – points to Unilever. The mega-corporation, which makes everything from Dove soap to Magnum ice cream, has pledged serious action on a variety of sustainability initiatives – including sourcing 100% of its energy for production from renewable sources by 2030 (it already cut its carbon emissions by 43% from 2008 to 2016). Other companies are working on similarly ambitious initiatives: Coca-Cola, Ikea and Walmart also have committed to 100% renewable energy. If it seems odd that companies seem to be talking the kind of talk heard more at NGOs, it shouldn’t. For one, it appeals to consumers. Recent research by Cone Communications, a PR agency for consumer brands, found that 87% of Americans said they would purchase a product because of a company’s alignment on an issue they cared about. It also attracts would-be workers: nearly two-thirds of millennials – the generation that will make up half of all US employees by 2020 – said they take a company’s social and environmental commitments into account when weighing a job offer. But it isn’t just about brand appeal. As Unilever outlines on its site, cutting waste and energy use, for example, means cutting both costs and exposure to price volatility. (The company says it already has shaved €700 million in costs since 2008 in this area alone). Corporate interest in climate change mitigation is also, of course, out of concern for global economic health. One 2016 study found that simply the effect of rising temperatures on workers’ productivity, particularly in already-warm climates like Asia and Africa, could cost the global economy more than $2 trillion by 2030. “The change in discussions in corporate boardrooms, and companies in general, on climate has been pretty profound,” says Winston. “There isn’t a large company in the world that isn’t talking about sustainability or climate. It’s just not possible to operate your business without talking about this.” Those factors may help explain why executives of companies from Goldman Sachs to Facebook expressed anger at President Trump’s announcement to withdraw the US from the Paris Climate Agreement. Some US CEOs, including Walt Disney’s Bob Iger and Tesla’s Elon Musk, resigned from the president’s advisory board in protest. Another signifier of how much corporations are not only taking climate change seriously, but also valuing climate-related skills, is in the salaries they’re paying people with that kind of expertise. In 2016, a survey of employees working in the corporate responsibility and sustainability sector, most of whom were in North America or Europe, found that the average salary was £61,000 ($87,000 in 2016 values); 12% of respondents earned £100,000 ($143,000) or more. Even in the UK, where the average salary was under that at £57,000, the average corporate responsibility professional pulled in twice the amount of the average full-time UK employee – who in 2016 made £28,000. Still, 63% of the same professionals in the study had a master’s or doctorate. “Frankly, they are underpaid relative to the expertise and value that they offer,” writes director of SystemiQ Jeremy Oppenheim in the study. One explanation, he says, is that “not enough companies still fully appreciate the economic value which the sustainability team brings to their business.” Similarly, says Winston, in their search for potential employees, most human resources departments, particularly in the US, seem to be behind in terms of how much they are weighing potential employees’ climate change competencies. “It’s lagging given the scale of the challenge. That’s because, for so many years, people thought it was political. You wouldn’t get in trouble saying ‘Hey, everyone should be trained in social media’, but you could if you were saying, ‘Hey, everyone should be trained in climate change,” he says. “But,” Winston adds, “that’s changing.” And that shift is already happening, he says – with or without US participation in the Paris Agreement.  -- Join 800,000+ Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter.

Volatility,The couples the world is obsessed by,2024-09-25,2021-06-22,Christina Newland,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20210621-what-makes-the-ultimate-hollywood-power-couple,"The apparent reunion of Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez has prompted mass jubilation. They are in a lineage of star romances that the world has fallen for, writes Christina Newland. Last week, a photo of Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck kissing at a Malibu restaurant apparently confirmed what many had suspected: that the pair are once again romantically involved, 17 years after they split up. Since speculation began about the couple being reunited over a month ago, after the both newly-single stars were spotted hanging out, delirious joy has seemed to spread like wildfire over social media. Maybe, for a generation of millennials, this jubilation is down to nostalgia, the news a reminder of their days idly flicking through gossip magazines back in an era when they had the time and inclination to peruse the glossy pages. Maybe – after years watching both stars deal with the vagaries of public life, complete with hit roles, Oscar wins, back tattoos, and a string of high-profile relationships for them both – it's heartwarming to see that love can somehow find a way. Especially the kind of only-in-Hollywood love that inspires a man to kiss his girlfriend's bottom for all the world to see, as Affleck did in Lopez's music video for 2002 single Jenny from the Block. More like this: –      Is the age of the celebrity over? –      Hollywood heartthrobs through the ages –      10 films to watch in June From the moment they started dating that same year, the pair were a designated Hollywood power couple, with Affleck's down-to-earth Boston guy persona and Lopez's super-glam style proving a heady contrast, as they graced countless red carpets. They became affectionately nicknamed 'Bennifer', and the press's love affair with the pair of them was seemingly never-ending, even in the face of Gigli (2003), their flop-of-all-flops romantic comedy which is often called one of the worst movies of all time. Then, in 2004, the pair broke up only a few days before a planned wedding date, and within a year both would be married to other people. (Affleck to the actress Jennifer Garner, and Lopez to singer Marc Anthony).  Now, come 2021, their relationship is once again being pored over and revelled in, only through new more democratic, social media channels: recently, a snap of a smirking Ben Affleck leaving Lopez's home in the morning was immediately transformed into a meme. So, what is it about Bennifer’s reunion that seems to have sparked such remarkable fanfare among the general public? The reasons for people's fascination It's a complex question with more than one answer. Partly, such a response is not unique to Lopez and Affleck; celebrity power couples have fascinated us for a long time. From Beyonce and Jay-Z to Kim and Kanye (who recently divorced) to Brad and Angelina (who divorced in 2016), the combined glamour of two A-listers can seem twice as arresting. The latter, like Lopez and Affleck, are specifically a Hollywood power couple, adding another layer of intrigue for an audience who can follow them not just in press coverage but also through their appearances in movies together. With Lopez and Affleck, their screen pairings (so far at least) have never been what we'd call a success; but think of the onscreen rapport over the years between real-life couple Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy, whose fast-paced squabbling and opposites-attract humour took them through classic screwball romances like Woman of the Year (1942) and Adam's Rib (1949). Their screen chemistry made them all the more lovable in the public's eyes. Such was the case, too, with Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor, who would star in 11 films together over the 60s and 70s. This run began with Cleopatra (1963), on the set of which the two met, but the combination of sexual heat and emotional volatility they were known for in real life is maybe best translated to screen in the vicious marriage drama Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (1966). It's not always a necessity that Hollywood power couples have potent screen chemistry, but it certainly helps the public imagination when they do. It may also be that our fascination with specific Hollywood power couples comes down to our individual preconceptions about what fame, celebrity, or heterosexual romance should look like. If you were asked to choose a 'favourite' Hollywood power couple, the answer may reveal more than you think about your romantic ideals, your ideal self, and what you might identify with in the story that this famous couple is telling the world. The Hollywood power couple is the forging of two distinct star personas, styles and personal baggage into one amorphous media construct – so amorphous that even their names become blended into something goofy-sounding. Some, like Brangelina, consist of two people both too attractive to seem real, and the combined force of their sexual chemistry (as displayed in 2005's Mr and Mrs Smith) is gobsmacking. The best ones have yin-and-yang, complementary qualities: Lauren Bacall gave Humphrey Bogart youthful zip and sensuality, all velvety smoothness to his jagged demeanour. Taylor was queenly enough to suit a Shakespearean actor like Burton, but the upper-class beauty was brought up a world away from the Welshman's more humble origins. Although affairs, romances, flings, and marriages happen in Hollywood as they do everywhere else, the concept of the power couple was a creation first and foremost by the studio-era publicity machine. That machine operated as an extension of each studio's interests and was fiercely protective of its contracted actors' reputations and images. In the 20th Century, that also meant that heterosexuality was compulsory, and even until fairly recently, that's remained mostly the case. In the case of LGBTQ+ actors, studio publicists of Golden-Age Hollywood were never beyond concocting romantic rumours for fan magazines or even sending stars out on fabricated dates to throw gossip columnists off the trail. Rock Hudson, Montgomery Clift, and other ""confirmed bachelors"", as the coded lingo went, were often set up with starlets for the paparazzi at premieres. As such, queer couples have largely been erased from the 'power couple' equation until, for the most part, the last two decades. Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi had an extravagant wedding in 2008, covered by all the major entertainment news outlets in the way any lavish celeb wedding might be. This year, Jodie Foster and her wife Alexandra Hedison made headlines when Foster accepted her Golden Globe via Zoom with the pair and their dog all in adorable matching pyjamas. But the wider exclusion of queer people from this form of imagery is in itself pretty telling: in the eyes of the media, extravagant coupledom seems to still be reserved for straight people.   The history of the Hollywood power couple The first Hollywood power couple in history was one many might not know of today: Mary Pickford, the silent film actress known as America's Sweetheart, and Douglas Fairbanks, the swashbuckling actor who played the first Robin Hood. The couple's palatial Beverley Hills home, set on 18 acres and featuring everything from a zoo to an old-west style saloon, boasted visitors like F Scott Fitzgerald and Charlie Chaplin in the 1920s. But it's something else about the house that’s really striking: decades before ""Bennifer"" hit the press, the house was nicknamed ""Pickfair"", a combination of the names Pickford and Fairbanks. Every move of the husband and wife was followed by the nation's press, still wide-eyed with the relatively new concept of movie stardom. Of course, we've had a wide variety of Hollywood power couples since then. Eccentric habits, tumultuous affairs, or ridiculous mansions never exactly hurt their status in the press: it's all grist for the mill, a part of the narrative of their coupledom. Crucially, it takes more than just two famous people to make one of these pairings. Both must be genuine stars, who are at once each renowned enough on their own merit and on something like equal standing in their fame. In the 40s and 50s, there was Ava Gardner, the sultry pin-up, and Frank Sinatra, the crooner that she ""stole"" from his nice Italian wife Nancy, as the media saw it. The Gardner-Sinatra affair and remarriage caused a scandal, but the pair would forever be associated with a certain brand of mid-century glamour. Today, there's Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith, who have grown mature and had children in front of our collective eyes; when Jada publicly admitted she had been unfaithful in a conversation with her husband on an episode of her show Red Table Talk, the discomfort in the audience was palpable. But the pair seem to have weathered it, joking with each other on the same episode, in a knowing reference to a catchphrase from Will's Bad Boys franchise: ""bad marriage for life!""   Then there were shorter-lived pairings that still burn bright in the cultural imagination: Anjelica Huston and Jack Nicholson were the cool kids of cinematic rebellion in the 70s, while the nattily attired Elliott Gould and Barbra Streisand, two of Hollywood's most prominent Jewish stars, also ruled the decade. Those were the sorts of couples whose dinner parties you'd love to be invited to. Taylor and Burton were so madly in love and yet so stormy that they divorced and then remarried again only 16 months later – only to divorce for the second time eight months later. Taylor had a total of seven husbands (eight if you count Burton twice). Some of them were pretty famous in their day, including actor Eddie Fisher. And yet no one seemed to meet the stature of Burton in her eyes, from the beginning of their torrid affair during the making of 1963's Cleopatra, when each was still married, to Fisher and actress Sybil Williams, respectively. Their amour fou and their lavish lifestyles were catnip for the public. As Burton had it, ""Our love is so furious we burn each other out"". Or maybe you prefer the steadiness of the adorable Goldie Hawn and the forever-hunky Kurt Russell, who have been together for nearly 40 years and still seem like teenage sweethearts. In the end, the public interest in the Hollywood power couple – as well as the question of what makes some more powerful than others – comes down to many things. Maybe it's some pre-conditioned social urge to see other humans romantically paired-off into cute little units, or stems from some prurient sexual desire for one or both people. Maybe – OK, definitely – we're just nosy. From Confidential Magazine, the audacious scandal mag that was taken to court in 1957 for its rumours about everyone from Grace Kelly to Robert Mitchum, to today's Instagram gossip source Deuxmoi, which publishes blind items from anonymous sources directly to its near one million followers, gossip is certainly not a new phenomenon. The public can't help themselves, even while knowing it's all a little vulgar and a little scurrilous. When it comes to the Hollywood power couple, even the break-up or divorce provides something to the audience. In the press and among its consumers, there is simultaneous sadness and schadenfreude: see, people crow, they aren't perfect after all. What's heartening about the reaction to the Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck reunion is that it's born, perhaps, of an inverse collective impulse: a determined, idealistic faith in the prospect of enduring love, even when it seems profoundly unlikely after so many years of two people being apart. Bennifer has set the whole world talking not because of who they are, but because of who we are. For many millennials, certainly, they make us feel as young and as hopeful as we were in 2002.

Volatility,Forecasting the news of tomorrow,2024-09-25,2012-02-22,Sharon Weinberger,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20120206-forecasting-the-news-of-tomorrow,"Want to know who will win the next US election, which films will bomb or which stocks will rise? Researchers are mining social media to find the answers. Peter Gloor does not own a crystal ball. Nor does he read tea leaves, the lines on your hand or claim to speak to people “from the other side”. Yet, the research scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) claims he can predict the future. Take the ongoing Republican nomination race. Late last year, Newt Gingrich was surging in the polls and some pundits thought he may well overtake frontrunner Mitt Romney. But Gloor predicted he would not. It was true that chatter on Twitter seemed to be giving an edge to the former House speaker, but analysing edits to Wikipedia, Gloor predicted that Romney would beat him. Gloor ended up being right: Romney beat Gingrich by a wide margin on the night. Of course, you could argue his prediction was just a fluke. But Gloor says his forecasts have worked time and again. In some cases, his analysis can even help predict electoral results where polls fail. For example, in 2009 Switzerland voted to bar the construction of new minarets on mosques. The polls wrongly indicated that people would reject the measure, while Gloor’s analysis, based on an analysis of social media, correctly predicted it would pass. “People lied to the pollsters, because they didn’t want to appear racist,” says Gloor. His research is part of a growing body of scientific work, often called predictive analytics, which involves using software and computer algorithms to mine emails, social media and other public websites to help make predictions about the future. It is a field that has caught the attention of everyone from movie moguls, who want help identifying which films will be popular, to captains of industry, who want advance information on which stocks are winners. And for those interested in politics, it is being used to forecast who will win in upcoming elections. ‘Enter the Swarm’ The idea of mining publicly-available data to help predict the future is nothing new, but past efforts focused primarily on the news media. In the run-up to World War II, the US and British governments monitored world media to help predict the course of hostilities, and during the Cold War, the US government sponsored academics to come up with mathematical models that would analyse media reports to help predict the actions of the Soviet Union. Over the past decade, however, the advent of social media sites like Facebook and Twitter has created a real-time flood of news about the world. Kalev Leetaru, a computer scientist at the University of Illinois, describes social media as something akin to “a gateway for humanity” because of the sheer abundance of data. “There are three billion items posted to Facebook every day and 200 million tweets,” he says. “One of my favourite figures is that right now, every day, there are more words posted to Twitter than were in the New York Times over the last 60 years.” The trick is in understanding what that data means, and which data is important for what topics. For example, Gloor says that Twitter is very good for predicting behaviour that is influenced by the crowd – the general public. When it comes to seeing a new film, for example, people are heavily influenced by what the crowd seems to say: is it a good or bad movie? It is a finding that has been put to the test by computer scientist Hsinchun Chen at the University of Arizona. Chen and his group have looked at data from hundreds of Hollywood movies and have attempted to correlate ticket sales with online data generated by social media users. The model worked “beautifully”, suggests Chen. His lab’s models also correctly predicted that the 2011 Mel Gibson movie The Beaver, about a man who speaks through a hand puppet, would bomb; so too would Jim Carey’s Mr. Popper’s Penguins. Neither received much pickup on social media, according to Chen. The lesson learned from looking at social media data and movies is that it does not matter who the star is, how much you spend on the movie, or even how good the movie is: what matters is what people are saying about it online. “The movie industry is buzz,” Chen suggests. “It’s not content.” Whilst this crowd approach works nicely for films, it starts to break down when applied to political events. Instead, researchers have to look for different types of data. This is where the “swarm” comes in, says Gloor. The swarm is a group of more neutral experts, such as those who regularly edit Wikipedia. “There are lots of Wikipedians, but just two or three thousand do most of the work,” he says. “We track those, how well respected they are, who’s editing what.” In the case of the Republican primaries, Gloor’s analysis in December noted that even though the masses on Twitter seemed to indicate a Gingrich victory, the swarm on Wikipedia was pointing to Romney. Future clues While those working in predictive analytics acknowledge that the wealth of information provided by social media is important, they are circumspect about its ability to be applied to all areas. Some events cannot be predicted well using social media, namely those which people simply don’t talk about online. “We probably cannot find any crimes,” says Gloor. “They will not be discussed in public.” Leetaru is even more wary of overly relying on social media to make predictions, arguing that in many cases even seemingly public events, like protests, have a hidden side to them. “If you look at the UK riots [in 2011], the first thing everyone said was [look at] Facebook and Twitter. But when they checked further, they realised that actually the rioters were using encrypted peer-to-peer Blackberry messages.” While Leetaru is also involved in forecasting social and political events, his current work focuses more on culling information from traditional media, including a retroactive analysis of news reports, which he said located Osama bin Laden’s hideout within a radius of 125 miles (200km). Social media, while providing a wealth of data, does not necessarily provide first-hand information, or better information. “All the work that is coming out seems to suggest that social media is more of a sounding box,” says Leetaru. “Something happens and social media reports on it.” For example, in looking at Kenyan election violence several years ago, Leetaru suggests that most of the social media messages coming out of the country were not necessarily first-hand reports about what people personally saw, but rather people retweeting or rebroadcasting news media reports. “So it wasn’t that they were reporting that they saw a tank heading down the street, they were basically using it almost as a real-time bulletin board,” he says. In many of these more complex cases, researchers are combining social media with news reports and other public data to help hone their forecasts. For example, Swedish-American firm Recorded Future, now based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, trawls hundreds of thousands of pieces of data, from government filings to social media, hunting for clues to the future. According to Christopher Ahlberg, the CEO of the firm, the company’s proprietary software grew out of a decade of previous work on large datasets. He and his coworkers grew interested in looking at ways to organise data in a time-based manner, allowing people to do Google-like searches on future events. “Media is full of these facts about the future,” suggests Ahlberg. “So, what we asked ourselves is could we build a machine – we used to jokingly call it a DVR for everything spoken and written about the future – and organise that data meticulously into a dataset, and set it up as a cool user experience?” The company did just that, and today, Recorded Future’s software is being used by private customers and government clients interested in data-mining the future. One example of how Recorded Future’s technology could be used, according to Ahlberg, might be someone following pharmaceutical stocks. The user clicks on a specific date, and Recorded Future shows all of the data mined from public information about things that are supposed to take place on that date, such as a review by the US Food and Drug Administration, the release of a new drug, or the expiration of a drug patent. All this information can hold vital clues for those in the know. And it could be a step towards predictive analytics’ ultimate prize: picking winning stocks. But Ahlberg and other researchers know this is a long way off. “Sometimes I find people want magic predictions,” Ahlberg says. “That doesn’t reflect reality.” Information overload Others agree this is still a tricky area. Gloor, who has used his models to try to outsmart the markets, has so far had only limited success. However, the work has thrown up at least one intriguing result: the models work best with alternative energy stocks. “There we have the tree-huggers, and tree-huggers are honest,” he says. “They talk about new developments that correspond to alternative energy.” Chen also concedes that financial markets are harder to predict than movies. “It’s not easy to predict a stock return: You can predict the movement, volume and volatility,” he says. “The return is still the Holy Grail.” Even if such analysis cannot always make precise forecasts, its potential for forecasting trends and events has increasingly attracted interest from the US government. Recorded Future, whose technology can also mine social media to forecast political protests, such as Occupy Wall Street, or track criminal activity, such as cyber attacks, has already attracted interest from the national security community. In-Q-Tel, the venture capital firm founded by the CIA, has invested in the company. In fact, the intelligence community’s interest in predictive modelling, particularly based on social media, has been growing over the past few years, especially in light of the Arab spring protests, which were at least partly fuelled by social media. Last year, the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (Iarpa), a research and development arm of the US intelligence community, launched a project called Open Source Indicators, designed to mine information from social media and other public data and to come up with predictions. The Pentagon has also launched a number of forecasting projects in recent years, hoping, for example, to predict insurgent behaviour. Mark Maybury, the US Air Force chief scientist, likens this sort of human-data collection – whether from social media, foreign news, or elsewhere – as something akin to the images collected by drones flying over Afghanistan. Only instead of information about bombs, it is collecting information about how people behave. “At the strategic national level, you’d like to do things like predict state failure,” said Maybury of the modelling work the Air Force is doing. “More tactically, you’d like to be able to do things like discover illicit shipping routes, human trafficking routes, and narcotics routes.” Yet one question that is only just starting to be discussed is whether the public is aware that their tweets, their Facebook posts and their Wikipedia edits are being sucked up by academics, private companies, the Pentagon, and even the CIA. In the modern world, people often do not think twice about tweeting their dinner plans, broadcasting their political opinion, or posting updates about a street protest. Even people who avoid Twitter or Facebook may be contributing information in ways they didn’t realise: a product review on Amazon, a comment on a news site or even something a simple as a search on their smart phone can all be collected and analysed. “People have become jaded to the information overload,” says Mark Abdollahian, a political scientist at Claremont Graduate University, who also works with a private company that creates political forecasting models. And it is not just social media: Abdollahian points to the latest iPhone’s popular new Siri voice application, which sends data back to Apple, where it is analysed along with other user information. All of this data, whether from social media or smart phone searches, is being analysed by someone for some purpose, whether to predict a political protest, a stock price, or even just to figure out what restaurant you’re trying to find. “Your queries go in there to make a better user experience. What do people do with the information?” Abdollahian says. “That’s the question we all need to ask.” If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.

Volatility,Octopus Energy to take over collapsed Bulb,2024-09-25,2022-10-29,By Oliver Slow,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63437352,"Energy supplier Octopus Energy is to buy its smaller competitor Bulb. Bulb collapsed last year amid rising gas and electricity prices and has since been run by the government. Its 1.5 million customers will not see any change or disruption to energy supplies, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said. The value of the deal has not been published but the BBC understands Octopus paid the government between £100m and £200m. It is expected to be completed by the end of November. Business Secretary Grant Shapps said the deal, approved by the UK government, would bring ""vital reassurance and energy security to consumers across the country at a time when they need it most"".  The government announcement on Saturday made no mention of the money involved in the deal, which was reached overnight between special administrators of Bulb and Octopus Energy. The statement said that ""due to high market volatility it is impossible"" to forecast the true cost of Bulb.  For Bulb customers, credit balances on bills will be protected and direct debits automatically transferred. Greg Jackson, Octopus Energy Group boss, said the company was determined to provide a ""stable home for the future"" for Bulb's customers and staff. Bulb has 650 employees. Mr Jackson told the BBC he was confident the takeover would be smooth, saying the company had ""a great track record"" when it came to moving customers across companies.  The firm has agreed to share profits - if any are made from its new Bulb customers - with the government, for up to four years.  Octopus said the move would bring ""an end to taxpayer losses"", adding it was ""paying the government"" to take on Bulb's customers.  It was previously reported in July that Octopus had requested £1bn in public funding for the deal. However a source close to the company has since categorically denied this.  London-based Bulb was the biggest of more than 30 energy companies that collapsed last November following a spike in wholesale gas prices, which was partly caused by Covid restrictions ending and has since been exacerbated by the war in Ukraine.  It was placed into ""special administration"", meaning it was run by the government through the regulator Ofgem. The special administration measure is only used if Ofgem is unable to find another company to take over an energy firm's customers.  The state bailout of Bulb had been forecast to cost the taxpayer around £2bn by next year. It was the biggest state bailout since the Royal Bank of Scotland collapse during the 2008 financial crisis. Natural gas prices have doubled since last October, and despite dropping significantly from a peak in August, many families are struggling to get by as they also grapple with rising inflation, which reached 10.1% in September.   As part of the mini-budget announced by former Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng in September, the government announced an ""energy price guarantee"" - capping typical household bills at £2,500 - for two years, but Jeremy Hunt - who replaced Mr Kwarteng as chancellor earlier this month - then said the support will last until April.  Mr Hunt is expected to make a full statement on his spending plans on 17 November.  Every household in the UK is also getting an energy bill discount of £400 this October. Mr Shapps, who became business secretary this week, said the deal highlighted the government's ""overriding priority"" to protect customers. He added he would do everything he could to ""ensure our energy system provides secure and affordable energy for all"".  Octopus will continue to use Bulb's technology and branding ""for a transitionary period"", the government's statement said. The company, which was founded in the UK in 2015, said that before the Bulb acquisition it served 3.4 million customers. "
Volatility,'Live' Bitcoin clothes tag shown off,2024-09-25,2014-02-04,Dave Lee,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-26031331,"The Bitcoin price changes depending on how much the virtual currency is currently worth A tag that shows an item's price in virtual currency Bitcoin and updates itself depending on market fluctuations has been shown off in east London. BitTag uses wireless technology to connect to the internet and check the value of Bitcoin, altering the tag display once a minute. Its creator hopes it will allow shops put off by Bitcoin's volatility to adopt the virtual currency. Bitcoin's value has surged and crashed often in recent months. Often, this has been down to high-profile hacks, or as a result of governments around the world, particularly China, commenting on the currency's future legal status.  Governments are keen to assert some control over a currency that has to date gained most attention as a method of anonymously buying drugs online. But the currency's backers and enthusiasts have stepped up efforts to show Bitcoin's other uses. ""Bitcoin is becoming more popular,"" said BitTag's creator, Samuel Cox, who describes himself as a creative technologist.   ""But there's a lack of infrastructure for people to buy things in the physical world because the value changes all the time."" In the past 12 months, Bitcoin's value has peaked at over $1000 (£615), but at times was as low as $421. The prototype BitTag device, which costs about £40, displays local currency as well as the Bitcoin price. By connecting to a tablet via Bluetooth, the device is able to check the latest value of Bitcoin and change its display accordingly. From here, a shopper can initiate a sale. The tags were on display at BoxPark, a ""pop-up"" shopping centre in tech-savvy Shoreditch ""[The] Bitcoin transaction can be activated by a simple 'shake' of the BitTag,"" the product's website explains. ""Enabling a Bitcoin QR code to be displayed on the display and scanned by the user's smartphone."" Due to the much higher cost compared with a standard price tag, Mr Cox conceded that BitTag's appeal was likely to be niche and more suited to ""quirky"" shops than major stores. Other attempts to bring the virtual currency into the real world include a Bitcoin cash machine shown off last year. Last month, Cumbria University said it would allow some students to pay their tuition fees using the currency.

Volatility,China property firm Country Garden suspends shares,2024-09-25,2024-04-02,By Mariko Oi,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68710728,"Crisis-hit Chinese property developer Country Garden has suspended trade in its shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange after delaying the publication of its annual financial results. The firm said last week that it needed more time to collect information as it restructures its debts. It defaulted on its overseas debt last year and faces a winding-up petition. In January, rival real estate giant China Evergrande was ordered to liquidate by a Hong Kong court. Country Garden said ""due to the continuous volatility of the industry, the operating environment the Group confronting is becoming increasingly complex"", when it announced its earnings report would be delayed. The first hearing for Country Garden's winding-up petition, which was filed by Ever Credit Ltd, is scheduled for 17 May. Ever Credit is a unit of Kingboard Holdings, a laminates maker and property investor. The suspension of Country Garden's shares came as the Hong Kong stock market reopened after the Easter weekend. Also on Tuesday, shares in Chinese state-backed property developer China Vanke fell to a record low. On Friday, the firm reported a fall of more than 50% in its annual profit and told investors that it aimed to boost its cash flow by slashing debt over the next two years. China's real estate industry has been facing a major financial squeeze since 2021 when the government introduced measures to curb the amount big developers could borrow. Several large Chinese property developers, including Evergrande and Country Garden, have defaulted on their debts in the last few years. Problems in the country's property market are having a major impact as the sector accounts for around a third of the economy. Beijing has announced various measures in a bid to boost housing demand. Last month, the country's financial markets regulator accused Evergrande and its founder, Hui Ka Yan, of inflating revenues by $78bn (£62.2bn) in the two years before the firm defaulted on its debt. The company's mainland business Hengda Real Estate was fined $583.5m while Mr Hui faces being banned for life from China's financial markets."

Volatility,The NI homes trialling 'green' heating technology,2024-09-25,2021-11-01,By Louise Cullen,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-59088957,"Fifty years after the last coal mine closed in Northern Ireland, fossil fuel is still powering most of our homes.    But a pilot scheme in County Fermanagh is trying out new, environmentally-friendly technology.    The initiative involves six Housing Executive homes in Lisnaskea.  Some have been fitted with solar panels, while others are using a heat pump, with an oil-fired boiler as a back-up.    Heat pumps extract warmth from the air, the ground or water - a bit like a fridge operating in reverse. They are powered by electricity, so if you have a low-carbon source of electricity, they provide greener heating. Irene McKiernan lives in one of the houses that is now on a hybrid heat pump.    ""I was a bit nervous, because it was a big, big job,"" she said.    ""There was a lot of upheaval.  New windows, every radiator had to be replaced, all the floorboards upstairs lifted to replace the pipes and the new hot tank, then the heating system itself out the back.  So it's all different, and a new oil tank and everything was just upside down for a bit.  ""But it was brilliant. I wanted to be part of something that was greener and more efficient.""  That ""upheaval"" was to bring the house up to an insulation standard that allows a heat pump to be at its most effective.    And now, in her back garden, there is still a small oil tank and an oil boiler which will kick in when the weather gets extremely cold - below freezing, for example.    But alongside it is the heat pump and, on the back wall, a box houses the electronic 'brain' that controls the whole system.    ""This system is reducing the carbon emissions between 40 to 55%,"" said Robert Clements, a sustainable development manager with the Housing Executive.    ""It's also improving thermal comfort, and we're trying to keep the bills down for the householder.""    Recent volatility in the international oil market has hit households in Northern Ireland hard, because it is so heavily dependent on fossil fuels.   Around two thirds of homes here are being heated by oil.    Less than a fifth of homes are on the gas network, which is currently being expanded in the south west.   Gas is seen as a transitional fuel from oil, on the way towards greener home heating.    The UK government has announced that fossil fuel heating systems will no longer be included in new-build homes from 2025.   In England and Wales, where gas is the predominant fuel, the government has also announced a £5,000 grant to help householders move to renewable energy in their homes.  But there is no such scheme here - yet.    ""We're waiting on the Energy Strategy,"" said Pat Austin, from the National Energy Association.    ""We need information, advice, and we will need grants.    ""People simply don't have that sort of resource to make the upfront move to decarbonisation.    ""To move from oil to heat pump and have the requisite cavity wall insulation, you're looking at the region of £12,000. People simply don't have that.

Volatility,Q&A: Dutch parliamentary election,2024-09-25,2012-09-05,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-19488679,"Rival parties are featured on election posters in Amsterdam Dutch voters will go to the polls on 12 September to elect a new lower house. The 150 seats will be allocated to political parties on the basis of proportional representation. The election was called early after the anti-Islamic Party for Freedom (PVV) withdrew its support for the centre-right minority government led by Prime Minister Mark Rutte. The previous government was formed by Mark Rutte's conservative-liberal People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) and the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) and depended on the PVV's support in parliament. In the 2010 election, the VVD won 31 seats, Geert Wilders' PVV 24, and the CDA 21.  Mark Rutte called an election after his coalition deal broke down The biggest party on the left has traditionally been the Labour Party (PvdA), which won 30 seats in 2010. This year the more left-wing Socialist Party (SP), which won only 15 seats in 2010, has also been doing well in opinion polls. Other parties represented in the current lower house are the liberal D66 (10 seats), Green Left (10), the Christian Union (5), the Protestant conservative Reformed Political Party (2), and the Party for Animals (2). Austerity measures and the country's relationship with the EU are two of the main issues in this election campaign. Geert Wilders' Freedom Party withdrew its support for Mark Rutte's government Mark Rutte tendered his government's resignation in April after Geert Wilders refused to back budget cuts intended to bring the deficit in line with EU rules. The PVV has since made leaving the EU and the euro its top priority, while continuing to call for a stop to ""Islamisation"". The VVD says it wants to address the country's financial problems now rather than leaving them to future generations. It emphasises the benefits of the EU's internal market while urging ""not more Europe but a better Europe"". On the left, the SP calls for ""more social, humane and sustainable"" policies and opposes the outgoing government's austerity plans. The party castigates the EU's ""regulation mania"" and urges respect for national sovereignty. The PvdA wants to balance ""responsible"" financial policies with investments and job creation, both in the Netherlands and in the EU. Yes, and they are said to have had a noticeable impact on the race. On 26 August, Mark Rutte for the VVD, Emile Roemer for the SP, Diederik Samsom for the PvdA and Geert Wilders for the PVV clashed in an RTL 4 TV debate described by Dutch media as ""lively"" and ""passionate"". Mr Samsom (L) has overtaken Mr Roemer (C) in opinion polls (Screengrab Dutch NOS website) Mr Samsom was judged to have won the debate by 51% of viewers taking part in an RTL online poll, while Mr Roemer came last on 6%. Since then the PS has lost a lot of ground to the PvdA in opinion polls. Another RTL 4 TV debate on 4 September, judged to be more ""orderly"", was again won by Mr Samsom, closely followed by Mr Rutte, according to an online poll. The newspaper de Volkskrant commented that debt-ridden Greece was the loser because for the first time Mr Rutte had said that he did not want to give Athens any more aid.  A final TV debate is due to be held by the NOS public broadcaster on the eve of the election. The race is wide open as opinion polls point to great volatility in voting intentions. For months it looked as if the VVD and the SP were vying for the top spot, but in recent days the SP has slumped and the PvdA has surged to put it neck-and-neck with the VVD. Meanwhile the PVV is still trailing in fourth place, followed by the CDA and D66. Neither the main right-wing nor the main left-wing parties appear to be heading for a clear majority, raising the prospect of another minority government or a multi-party coalition. Coalition negotiations in the Netherlands tend to be drawn-out affairs. They lasted 127 days in 2010, while the post-war record stands at 208 days in 1977.

Volatility,Chad 'repaying $100m debt to Angola with cattle',2024-09-25,2020-03-17,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-51925035,"Chad is repaying Angola a debt of $100m (£82m) with cattle, Angola's state-run newspaper has reported.    The unusual agreement is seen as creating a win-win situation for both nations - Chad is short of cash while Angola needs cattle.  More than 1,000 cows arrived by ship in Angola's capital, Luanda, as the first payment, Jornal de Angola reported. In total, Angola would receive 75,000 cattle over 10 years, meaning it has accepted payment of $1,333 per animal.  Chad would send a further 3,500 head of cattle later this month, the report added.  Chad had proposed repaying the 2017 debt with cattle, and Angola had agreed because it would help the southern African state rebuild its cattle population in drought-affected areas, the state-run daily paper said. Angola is often hit by drought, causing animals to die of hunger and thirst and leaving many villagers destitute.  Although oil rich, the country is still striving to recover from the legacy of a 27-year civil war that ravaged the country after independence. Chad is described by the the World Health Organisation of Animal Health (OIE) as a ""livestock farming country par excellence"", with about 94 million head of cattle.  Livestock accounts for 30% of Chad's exports, and is its main source of foreign exchange after oil.  In a report last October, the World Bank said Chad's economy ""remains fragile and vulnerable to considerable risk, such as oil price volatility and regional insecurity"" caused by militant Islamist groups operating in the region.

Volatility,House prices up 8.5% in 2020 amid tax holiday,2024-09-25,2021-02-17,By Simon Read,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56095357,"UK house prices climbed 8.5% in 2020, the highest annual growth rate since October 2014, according to official figures. The average UK house price reached a record high of £252,000 in December 2020, the Office for National Statistics said. The North West had the highest growth of 11.2%, while London rose just 3.5%. The stamp duty holiday due to end this March contributed to the rise, the ONS said. Spending more time at home in the pandemic meant some people also decided they needed more space. That was reflected in the average price of detached properties climbing by twice as much as flats and maisonettes during 2020, up 10% and 5% respectively. Meanwhile Wales experienced the fastest price growth, with property values rising 10.7% to £184,000. In England, prices climbed 8.5% to £269,000, in Scotland, 8.4% to £163,000 and in Northern Ireland 5.3% to £148,000. ""Recent price increases may reflect a range of factors including pent-up demand, some possible changes in housing preferences since the pandemic and a response to the changes made to property transaction taxes across the nations,"" the ONS said. The UK housing market is made up of lots of local markets, with different factors affecting property prices such as the performance of schools and the availability of jobs. The ONS figures are based on sale completions. Although average London prices were up by 3.5%, over last year, prices fell in the capital by £5,000 between November and December, despite a UK-wide price increase of 1.2% over the month. But the city still has the highest average house price in the UK, at £496,000. The North East continued to have the lowest average house price at £141,000, and has become the final English region to surpass its pre-economic downturn peak of July 2007. ""2020 was the year that fundamentals came home to roost,"" said Nicky Stevenson, managing director at estate agent Fine & Country.  ""There was no escaping a lack of space for households who suddenly found they were living on top of each other with little respite. That has powered annual growth that reached a six-year high."" There were four major drivers of overall house price rises in 2020, said Anna Clare Harper, chief executive of asset manager SPI Capital. ""The temporary stamp duty reduction and cheap debt as a result of very low interest rates, which give buyers a 'discount'; the release of pent-up supply and demand and desire to improve surroundings amongst existing homeowners; and the 'flight to safety', since in times of uncertainty, people want to keep their money in a stable asset with low volatility. ""But looking to the future when the temporary stamp duty reduction ends, we're likely to see a slowdown in house price rises,"" she said. ""However, there is still some life in the market as lockdown helps to concentrate many potential buyers and sellers' minds as far as moving is concerned,"" said north London estate agent Jeremy Leaf.  ""Intense speculation remains as to whether the 31 March stamp duty deadline will be extended and we can't help but have sympathy for many who have started the process several months ago who have been unavoidably delayed by a backlog in searches, surveys, conveyancing, or all three, to say nothing of problems in the new-build industry."""
Volatility,Battle for the heart of Georgia,2024-09-25,2012-08-08,Damien McGuinness,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-19160605,"Many of Bidzina Ivanishvili's supporters are attracted by his 'good guy' image Georgia has just announced that parliamentary elections will be held on 1 October. They are being seen as the biggest test facing the country's democracy since the Rose Revolution in 2003.  Until the end of last year it looked like President Mikheil Saakashvili's governing party would win this election easily. A boringly predictable affair - welcome in a country where elections can provoke crisis and instability.  But now the volatility is back in Georgian politics.  The country's richest man, Billionaire tycoon Bidzina Ivanishvili, whose $6.4bn (£4.1bn) fortune is worth almost half  Georgia's economic output, has vowed to oust the ruling party from power. And the fight is getting nasty. Mr Ivanishvili accuses the government of targeting him, in an attempt to stamp out political opposition.  He says he has been fined more than $200m, allegedly for breaking party funding rules. After moving to the opposition, he was stripped of his Georgian nationality, ostensibly for holding other citizenships, he says. And his supporters claim they are being harassed by the authorities.  According to Mr Ivanishvili, it is all part of President Saakashvili's strategy to crush any political opponent.  ""He has managed to persuade the US and Europe that he's building a real democracy. But nothing like that has been happening in this country over the last few years.  ""The biggest injustice which we have in Georgia right now is this facade of pretend justice,"" Mr Ivanishvili said.  But the government alleges that Mr Ivanishvili is illegally using his massive wealth to skew the political landscape.  He is accused of breaking strict laws on how political parties should be funded. These cap the amount individuals and companies can donate.  Mr Ivanishvili is suspected of transferring funds via third parties to get round the law, or of receiving illegal corporate donations in the form of free office space or transport for political activists.   And his charitable donations, of around $100m a year, are nothing more than voter bribery, says governing party MP Davit Darchiashvili. ""Personalities in politics and personal allegiances mean more than political programmes here,"" he says. ""So when someone comes and says that I'm going to pay whoever supports me, it's a risky thing for Georgia's development towards democracy."" Georgia's richest man, Bidzina Ivanishvili, says the president is trying to crush dissent There is not much difference in concrete policy between the two sides.  Both have announced ambitious plans to tackle the country's high levels of poverty - mainly by throwing money at the problem.  But the battle for power has created a fault line down the middle of Georgian society.  With a reputation for benevolence and philanthropy, Mr Ivanishvili is popular among many poorer voters who are struggling in modern Georgia's neo-liberal economy.  He funded public buildings in Tbilisi, including the cathedral and the university. And even paid MPs' salaries and bought uniforms for the police in the first years after the 2003 Rose Revolution.  Talking recently to market traders who scrape by earning a few dollars a day, an enthusiastic thumbs-up was given every time Mr Ivanishvili was mentioned - although it was difficult to find concrete reasons why they liked him.  ""He's a good guy,"" was the usual answer. At the market, it was difficult to come across anyone who supported the government.  Mr Ivanishvili is also backed by many older Georgians, who feel left behind by President Saakashvili's young, savvy elite.  And urban intellectuals accuse the president of authoritarianism, saying he controls the courts and the mainstream media.  They feel this fervently pro-Western government has undermined Georgia's artistic and intellectual traditions, in favour of a more superficial American-style society.  But for many other Georgians, with memories still fresh of the war-torn and crime-ridden 1990s, President Saakashvili's team has brought an unprecedented period of stability and economic growth.  And his government is open and tolerant towards religious, sexual and ethnic diversity - compared to which some of Mr Ivanishvili's colleagues are worryingly nationalistic.   When he came to power after the 2003 Rose Revolution, President Saakashvili swept aside the corrupt Soviet-era elite.  He fulfilled many of the promises he made to the cheering crowds from the steps of parliament - he was tough on criminals, made the streets safe and got the lights working again.  Many voters are afraid that without Mr Saakashvili's ruling party, the country could slip back into chaos. One of them is Nino, an elderly woman who supplements her pension by selling small pots of honey and home-made wine from a tiny cave of a shop.   Like many people, she fears returning to a time when Georgia was a failed state. And she's suspicious of the leader of the opposition, who earned his wealth in 1990s Russia, and is accused of having links with the Kremlin.  ""I don't think [Mr Ivanishvili] has the brains and experience needed to run the country - he'd have to rely on having clever people around him. But they would just act in their own interests. So the country would be torn apart."" As October's elections approach, tensions are mounting - fistfights between supporters of both sides are frequent.  President Saakashvili is considered reliable, but many say he has fostered a superficial society At one recent campaign meeting, at least a dozen activists and journalists were hospitalized after a fight broke out. Western observers hope the elections themselves will pass off more peacefully.  But a lot is at stake. President Saakashvili's ruling party has a lead in all independently-funded and well-respected polls.  But Mr Ivanishvili has already said that he does not accept these figures, and has refused to sign a pledge to accept the outcome of the election peacefully.  This has led to fears that the opposition may dispute the results and provoke unrest.  But this vote is also the biggest challenge yet to face President Saakashvili's party.  In the West the elections are being seen as a litmus test to show how far along Georgia is on the path to eventual Nato and EU membership, and whether the government can live up to its promises of democratic reform.  When there was no opposition it was easy to espouse democratic values of free and fair competition.  But faced with a wealthy opponent who is supported by a large chunk of the population, those democratic ideals are now being put to the test.

Volatility,'My future has been set back completely',2024-09-25,2020-08-13,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-53765190,"For students across England, Northern Ireland and Wales the wait is finally over for A-level and vocational qualification results. But with exams cancelled because of the coronavirus pandemic, many have seen their teacher-predicted grades lowered, leading to disappointment and confusion. ""My future has been set back completely,"" says Abbi Fitzgerald. The student at Wilberforce Sixth Form College in Hull got a Distinction* in her engineering BTec - the highest grade possible - but for her A-levels she got Ds in maths and art and an E in physics, after the results predicted by her teachers were downgraded. ""When I opened them I had a bit of a cry,"" she tells the BBC. This year, schools submitted predicted grades to exam boards and ranked pupils based on who they thought would do best.  The exam boards then took into account data from previous years to adjust the marks, with the aim of ensuring consistency.  But headteachers have spoken of ""volatility"" in the results, with some saying lowered grades seem to be unfair. For Abbi, this means she misses out on a place at Durham University to study engineering, and she says she is now considering sitting her exams later in the year or finding a place at another university through clearing. ""I had my heart set on Durham and it's now not an option for clearing because there's no clearing for my course,"" she adds.  Abbi says the grading system seems ""unfair"".  Vocational qualifications like BTecs often have continuous assessments throughout the course, but many A-level subjects rely primarily on exams at the end of the year, making it harder to predict grades. ""It goes to show that the ones I was supposed to do exams in that I didn't get to, I got awful grades, I got downgraded,"" she says. ""And the one that reflects all the work I've done over the past two years, I got the highest grade that I could possibly get."" She says she is angry her results have been affected by something out of her control, adding: ""I would have happily sat the exams but it was up to the government."" For Maimuna Hassan, from Acton in west London, her results also came as a ""complete shock"".  After being predicted A*A*A by her teachers, she was only awarded A*AB, meaning she missed her university offers to study engineering at Cambridge and Imperial College London. Maimuna believes her results were downgraded because of the historically lower grades at her comprehensive school in Chiswick, which has twice been rated as ""requires improvement"" by Ofsted inspectors. ""They didn't take individual circumstances into account,"" she adds.  Born in Switzerland and the eldest child of Somali immigrants, English is her third language and Maimuna says she had to work harder than most to achieve top grades throughout her school career.  She now feels ""let down"" by the system and says she has little faith in the appeals process which could allow her mock results of A*A*A to be used instead.  On Wednesday, the Department for Education announced that for pupils in England, if their results day grades are lower than their mock exams they can appeal - but this will have to be through their school, with the terms for approving appeals to be decided by regulator Ofqual. They also have the option of taking a written exam in the autumn, giving them the chance to secure a higher grade. But with just two months to prepare Maimuna worries she would not fulfil her potential. ""I'm going to start revising tomorrow just in case,"" she adds. Toby Newton, from Hillingdon in west London, was on track to achieve his dream of studying medicine, with predicted grades of A*A*A. However, his plans have been put on hold after he was only awarded BBC. ""It was incredibly disheartening,"" he says, adding that many of his school friends are in a similar situation. ""I feel like the government have let us down and I'm hoping they'll reconsider the points and how they are being rewarded."" Toby now plans to appeal to see if his mock results of ABB can be used instead and is looking at the option of studying at a European university. ""I've always wanted to be a doctor and I still want to be a doctor, so it hasn't put me off,"" he says. Not everyone is disappointed, though. Overall results across England, Northern Ireland and Wales show record highs for A* and A grades at A-level. Caitlyn Foley, a student at Merthyr College in south Wales, says she is ""very pleased"" after being awarded an A* and three As. ""It's been a bit weird having to deal with all the changes so last minute,"" she says. ""I was nervous, just because I knew I worked hard all throughout the year, and I was disappointed because I couldn't perform and do my exams and prove it to myself."" Others have benefitted from the last-minute changes. Fellow student Tom Bush was awarded an A and two Bs but this will be upgraded to two As and a B, after ministers in Wales promised students' A-level result this year would be no lower than what they achieved at AS-level the previous year. However, he says he still found the uncertainty leading up to results day ""frustrating"".  ""I know things happen but we've had quite a long time to prepare for this and it seems to just have all gone up in the air a couple of days before."""
Volatility,UK in surprise boost after record tax payments,2024-09-25,2023-02-21,Michael Race,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-64705051,"The UK government saw a surprise surplus in its finances in January despite ""substantial spending"" to help with energy bills and EU payments. The highest self-assessed income tax receipts since records began in 1999 boosted the UK's coffers. It meant it spent less than it received in tax, leaving a £5.4bn surplus. Economists said the figures showed a ""mixed picture"" with public finances still weaker than this time last year ahead of next month's Budget. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt will set out his plans for tax and spending on 15 March.  Martin Beck, chief economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club which is a UK economic forecasting group, said the figures gave Mr Hunt ""some positives to work on"" in his Budget. Mr Beck said the fall in cost of wholesale energy meant the government's spending on support for bills ""will be a fraction"" of what was officially forecast last year. However, because the government's self-imposed fiscal rules around debt relate to five years in the future, he said short-term movements in UK's finances ""don't have much bearing"" on policies. Public borrowing in the financial year to date is £30.6bn less than predicted by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the government's official forecaster.  Michal Stelmach, senior economist at KPMG UK, said this could ""tempt the chancellor to offer a pay increase to public sector workers as part of his Budget next month"" in a bid to prevent further strikes. But Mr Hunt said debt was still at the highest level since the 1960s. ""It is vital we stick to our plan to reduce debt over the medium term,"" he added. ""Getting debt down will require some tough choices, but it is crucial to reduce the amount spent on debt interest so we can protect our public services."" Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's spokesman later indicated the surplus did not mean it would announce tax cuts at the Budget. ""We shouldn't place too much emphasis on a single month's data. Borrowing remains at record highs and there is significant uncertainty and volatility, both clear risks to the fiscal position,"" the spokesman said. Every January, the government tends to take more in tax than it spends in other months due to the amount it receives in self-assessed taxes, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). But most economists had expected borrowing to rise this time, in part due to the large amount the government is spending on supporting households with their energy bills. It is limiting the average household energy bill to £2,500 - although it says this will increase to £3,000 from April due to the high cost of the support. In addition, the ONS said the government had faced ""large one-off payments"" in January relating to historic customs duties owed to the EU. In the end, though, these costs were largely offset by record self-assessed income tax payments of £21.9bn in January, which left the government with a surplus.  It's not just an unexpected surge in tax receipts from the self-employed that caught most economists on the hop this morning, resulting in a surplus instead of the anticipated deficit.  Separate figures published this morning by HMRC show the amount received in tax and national insurance in the financial year to date was £368.5bn - a huge increase of £44.9bn compared to the same period a year earlier.  The government points out that debt (ie all the accumulated borrowing over the years) is at its highest since the 1960s and says it will require ""tough choices"". But there's no doubt that the public finances are under much less pressure - £31bn less - than the OBR anticipated in November.  Amid calls, for example, to spend £2.6bn preventing a further rise in energy bills, or more money to alleviate the recruitment crisis in the NHS, an argument that any of those measures is ""unaffordable"" in any objective economic sense isn't given any obvious support in the data.  But despite the surprise figures, January's overall surplus was still £7.1bn smaller compared to the same month in 2022. Interest repayments on government debt also hit their highest level for January since records on that data began in 1997. The ONS said the rise in debt repayments, which totalled £6.7bn in January, was ""largely"" because of inflation. This is because many UK government bonds, or ""gilts"", which the government sells to international investors to raise the money it needs, are ""index linked"", meaning the government's repayments rise in line with the Retail Prices Index (RPI) measure of inflation, which is currently at double-digit levels. Of the interest payable in January 2023, some £3.3bn reflected the impact of inflation, the ONS said."
Volatility,UK growth rebound eases recession fears,2024-09-25,2019-09-09,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-49632627,"The UK's economy grew faster than expected in July, easing fears that it could fall into recession. The economy grew 0.3% in July, the UK's official statistics body said, helped by the dominant services sector. Growth was flat over the three months to July, but this was an improvement on the 0.2% contraction seen in the April-to-June quarter. This contraction, coupled with some weak business surveys, raised concerns the UK was heading for recession. An economy is generally deemed to be in recession if it contracts for two quarters in a row. However, while growth in the services sector - which accounts for about 80% of the UK economy - helped to drive July's stronger-than-expected growth figure, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) warned that the sector remained weak. ""While the largest part of the economy, the services sector, returned to growth in the month of July, the underlying picture shows services growth weakening through 2019,"" the ONS said. The pound rose in reaction to the figures, rising 0.6% against the dollar to $1.2357. The return to growth in the economy in the month of July will be a political relief for a troubled government keen to avoid recession headlines in early November. It makes unlikely the notion of another consecutive quarter of contraction between July and September, the definition of a recession.  But that does not make the economic reality rosy. In the three months to July, the economy did not grow. Even with a Q3 registering 0.3% growth, it would be the weakest first three quarters of a year since the financial crisis.  Over nine months, much of the volatility around no-deal - stockpiling effects and car industry shutdowns - should have been stripped out too. There is some evidence in the figures that firms are beginning to restart stockpiling in anticipation of the rising possibility of no-deal Brexit next month.  It is difficult to predict how the current political impasse affects those patterns. But a prolonged squeeze on business investment was always going to hit productivity and growth.  The global context is far from benign too, with the German economy looking likely to be in recession and the eurozone as a whole growing sluggishly.  Other survey indicators for the UK look more difficult too. But if July's pattern continued last month and into this, the government should, when full Q3 figures are released in November, be able to avoid the R-word, for now.  The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) also said that concerns remained. ""Although there was a rise in GDP between June and July, the zero growth recorded on the underlying three-month measure points to an economy under pressure from uncertainty over Brexit and weakening global economic conditions,"" said Suren Thiru, head of economics at the BCC. ""The manufacturing sector remains an area of concern, with tightening cash-flow, concerns over disrupted supply chains and weakening demand in key markets weighing on activity in the sector."" Last week, a series of downbeat surveys of various sectors of the economy had raised fears that the UK was at risk of slipping into recession. However, analysts said the latest GDP figures appeared to have dampened these concerns. ""The pick-up in GDP in July is a reassuring sign that the economy is on course to grow at a solid - perhaps even above-trend - rate in Q3,"" said Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, adding that figures ""substantially"" weakened the case for any cuts in UK interest rates ""before Britain's Brexit path is known"". ""The upside surprise came from the services sector, which displayed broad-based strength and did not seemingly benefit from any one-off stimuli,"" Mr Tombs said. Analysts also noted that August's growth figure should be boosted by car manufacturers, which were operating last month, contrary to normal practice. Many carmakers had brought their annual shutdown forward for the original Brexit date in March. ""GDP will get a further boost of about 0.2% in August, when car manufacturers will be at work when they are usually on holiday,"" said Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics. ""Overall, the economy is still fairly weak - we estimate that the underlying pace of growth is around +0.2% quarter-on-quarter - but it's not in recession. Political chaos, yes. Economic chaos, no."""
Volatility,US stocks see worst first half drop since 1970,2024-09-25,2022-07-01,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-62005360,"US stocks have seen their worst first half of a year since 1970, as concerns grow over how steps to curb inflation will affect economic growth. In the last six months, the benchmark S&P 500 index fell 20.6%, while other major US indexes also dropped sharply. Stocks in the UK, mainland Europe and Asia have also suffered steep losses. It comes as central banks around the world are trying to rein in soaring living costs, with prices of essential goods like food and fuel jumping. Some economists expect the US, which is the world's biggest economy, to go into a recession as early as this year as interest rates continue to rise. ""If the US Federal Reserve continues hiking rates the stock market will react quite negatively,"" Dan Wang, chief economist at Hang Seng Bank China, told the BBC. Shane Oliver at AMP Capital said: ""Shares are likely to see continued short-term volatility as central banks continue to tighten to combat high inflation, the war in Ukraine continues and fears of recession remain high."" Another major US stock index, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, fell by more than 15% in the first half of this year, the biggest drop for the period since 1962. At the same time the technology-focused Nasdaq Composite lost almost 30%, marking its largest percentage drop for the first half of a year. Major stock market indexes outside the US have also fallen sharply this year. The UK's FTSE 250 has dropped by more than 20%, while Europe's Stoxx 600 index has slipped by almost 17% and the MSCI index of Asia-Pacific markets has fallen by more than 18%. It comes as many of the world's biggest central banks take steps to slow the rising cost of living, including raising interest rates. Earlier this week, the bosses of three of the world's biggest central banks warned that the era of moderate inflation and low interest rates had ended. At an annual meeting in Portugal, the heads of the US Federal Reserve, European Central Bank and Bank of England said action must be taken quickly to prevent price rises from getting out of control. However, they also cautioned that measures to rein in an inflation shock caused by the Ukraine war and pandemic may have a significant negative impact on global growth. ""Is there a risk that we would go too far? Certainly there's a risk, but I wouldn't agree that it's the biggest risk to the economy,"" Fed chairman Jerome Powell said. ""The bigger mistake to make, let's put it that way, would be to fail to restore price stability,"" he added. Last month, the Fed announced its biggest rate rise in nearly 30 years as it ramped up its fight to rein in soaring consumer prices. The Bank of England also raised its key interest rate to the highest level in 13 years, from 1% to 1.25%. You may also be interested in:"
Volatility,"Shopping habits have changed for good, says Aldi",2024-09-25,2023-09-25,Emma Simpson,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-66905403,"The cost-of-living crisis has changed shopping habits for good, according to the boss of Aldi in the UK and Ireland.  Giles Hurley says shoppers are buying more own-label products than ever before and he expects this to stick. Cheaper supermarket own-label ranges are enjoying a boom as shoppers try to save money. Aldi overtook Morrisons last year to become the UK's fourth-biggest supermarket. Alongside rival Lidl it has been the fastest-growing this year. Products that are sold under a supermarket's own name now make up more than half of everything shoppers buy, by value. ""If you look in volume terms that figure is much bigger and at the moment own-label products are growing at twice the rate of branded goods,"" says Mr Hurley. ""Why would [shoppers] go back?"" The vast majority of the products Aldi and Lidl sell are own-label.  He says Aldi has added nearly a million more customers in the past 12 months and two-thirds of UK households are now shopping with the chain. Aldi has now released its financial results for the year to the end of December 2022.  UK sales were up by nearly £2bn to £15.5bn. Operating profit also increased to £178.7m, almost triple the amount it made the year before.   Other big supermarkets have reported a drop in profits. Lidl made an annual loss.  Aldi said the increase was due to an exceptional prior year when its profit margin fell to an 11-year low of 0.4% after significant Covid-related costs.  ""It's really important to stress that margins in retail are extremely tight and we are no exception,"" said Mr Hurley.   Its profit margin, the measure of how much money a company makes on its products after costs and expenses, was 1.2% last year.  ""That's just over a penny in every pound spent in an Aldi store,"" Mr Hurley points out. Aldi has now set a long-term target of having 1,500 UK stores, up from 1,200 previously. It opened its 1,000th store in Woking earlier this month and plans to invest a further £1.4bn in the UK over the next two years. Finding the right sites, particularly in the south-east of England and London, is far from easy, though.  And will shoppers stay loyal to Aldi when this cost-of-living crisis is over?  Some affluent shoppers may well decide to ""trade up"" again. Retail expert Catherine Shuttleworth says brands are the lifeblood of innovation in the food and drinks sector but thinks they're going to have to work hard through marketing campaigns to persuade shoppers that their products are worth paying more for. ""The supermarkets' loyalty card pricing schemes will encourage brand participation and brands should be very eager to showcase their products to millions of shoppers every week in the battle to get us to trade back into brands.""  For instance, earlier this month Sainsbury's offered 50% off all Heinz branded products with a Nectar card.  But Ms Shuttleworth believes our ""thrifty approach"" during the cost-of-living crisis isn't going to go away anytime soon.  ""Discount shopping is here to stay, so much so that shoppers don't even call Aldi and Lidl discounters any longer - they are their supermarkets of choice.""  On a visit to an Aldi store on the outskirts of Leicester where they are testing new ideas, including chiller doors on most of their fresh products to save energy, Giles Hurley dismissed suggestions from some in the industry that Aldi had now hit ""peak disruption""  ""There is a huge demand for our offer here in the UK... I frequently get customers writing to me asking for an Aldi store to come to their town or community.""  ""We have huge ambitions.""  His mantra is that Aldi ""will never be beaten on price.""  But bigger rivals aren't allowing Aldi, nor Lidl, to have it all their own way.  Competition in the supermarket aisles is as intense as ever with Tesco and Sainsbury's running Aldi price-matching schemes.   Food price inflation is now easing but remains stubbornly high, rising 13.6% in the year to August, according to the Office for National Statistics.  Supermarkets have been cutting prices on a wide range of products over the last few months.  At Aldi, Mr Hurley said customers would continue to see price reductions in the medium term but the future was far more difficult to judge given how volatile the last two years had been, with commodity costs, energy and fuel prices. ""That volatility is still continuing.""   Ms Shuttleworth says the key for Aldi will to be to ""stick to their knitting"" and maintain a price differential to their rivals. This which will mean having to accept lower profit margins and driving as much volume as possible.   It says it can afford to take a long-term view as a privately-owned business. "
Volatility,Eurozone rates in record rise to fight inflation,2024-09-25,2022-09-08,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-62837336,"The European Central Bank has announced a record rise in eurozone interest rates as it seeks to fight inflation. Prices in the bloc are rising at the highest pace for half a century as energy costs soar. The ECB lifted all its key rates by three-quarters of a percentage point and warned that it was likely to raise rates again later this year. The bank had raised interest rates in July, its first increase in more than 11 years. ""Price pressures have continued to strengthen and broaden across the economy,"" the ECB said after its latest decision. The ECB raised its key deposit rate - how much interest it pays on deposits - to 0.75% from zero, and lifted its main refinancing rate - how much banks have to pay when they borrow money from the ECB - to 1.25% from 0.5%. Central banks raise interest rates to increase the cost of borrowing, which should lead people to borrow and spend less, and to save more. In theory, this helps curb price rises. Inflation around the world is being driven by higher energy prices. Prices were rising more quickly as economies recovered from the effects of the coronavirus pandemic, but they jumped further due to Russia's war in Ukraine. ECB president Christine Lagarde said the central bank could not control high energy prices. ""I cannot reduce the price of energy,"" she said. ""I cannot convince the big players of this world to reduce gas prices. I cannot reform the electricity market. And I am very pleased to see that the European Commission is considering steps to that effect because monetary policy is not going to reduce the price of energy."" She added that if gas prices continue to ""skyrocket"", that would be ""recessionary"". If Russia were to cut gas supplies to the EU completely, then one scenario the ECB envisages - if it is not possible to secure alternative gas supplies from Asia, Norway and the US - is gas rationing across the whole euro area and a recession in 2023, Ms Lagarde said. With the ECB statement explicitly saying more rate hikes would be needed, markets continue to expect another half-point rise at the bank's October meeting. Euro area inflation is expected to be 9.1 % in August, up from 8.9 % in July, according to Eurostat. Janet Mui, head of market analysis at wealth manager Brewin Dolphin, said the ECB was ""playing catch up"" with the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England, which have already been raising rates. The ECB has forecast eurozone inflation of 8.1% this year, 5.5% in 2023 and 2.3% in 2024, but ""these are subject to a high degree of uncertainty given the volatility in gas prices"". With high energy prices sapping purchasing power, some economists predict a eurozone downturn. Some policymakers have talked about a recession, and the ECB's new projections also show sharply lower growth in the coming years. ""After a rebound in the first half of 2022, recent data point to a substantial slowdown in euro area economic growth, with the economy expected to stagnate later in the year and in the first quarter of 2023,"" the ECB said."
Volatility,Prepay energy customers disconnect over price rises,2024-09-25,2022-04-29,Oliver Smith,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-61270970,"Record numbers of prepay gas and electricity customers in the UK stopped topping up their meters after energy prices soared, Citizens Advice said. By the end of April, the charity will have seen more than 1,300 cases of people going without pay-as-you-go power - known as self-disconnection. It comes after a 54% rise in the energy price cap added an average £700 to annual household bills. The Treasury said energy bills were capped until the autumn.  ""We won't know yet what the size of the rise will be given the volatility of prices we are seeing now and it's right that we wait until we know how big the rise will be before we decide what the solution should be,"" a Treasury spokesman said. Citizen's Advice said its projected figures on the number of self-disconnections for April had increased eight-fold on the 162 cases it saw in the same month last year. The number of callers seeking help because they cannot afford to top up their meters is already higher than the total figure for 2021, the charity told the BBC. Citizens Advice chief executive Claire Moriarty said prepayment customers were being hit hard by the April price increases. ""This can have devastating consequences - parents with no hot water to bathe their children, families sleeping in their coats and people with chronic illnesses who can't keep warm,"" she said. ""The warning lights could not be flashing brighter and the worst is yet to come. The government must bring in more support to help people cope with this mounting crisis."" At the start of April, about 18 million households on standard tariffs saw their energy bills rise by an average of £693 from £1,277 to £1,971 per year.  But for the 4.5 million prepayment customers, often on low incomes, the increase was higher - up £708 from £1,309 to £2,017.  The energy regulator Ofgem has previously defended the difference, saying there are higher fixed costs associated with running a prepayment meter. Earlier this month, energy bosses warned MPs that millions of people could fall into fuel poverty this winter as a result of price increases.  Keith Anderson, chief executive of Scottish Power, told the Business, Energy, and Industrial Strategy committee (BEIS) that it was ""perverse"" that prepayment customers paid more than others, whilst E.ON UK's boss Michael Lewis said that April's bill increases would have ""a severe impact on customers ability to pay"". Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced a repayable £200 discount on bills for homes in England, Wales and Scotland from October, and a further £150 council tax rebate for most households in England. But Labour criticised the plan, calling it a ""buy now, pay later scheme"". Energy firm Utilita has over 800,000 customers, most of them on prepayment smart meters. At the company's headquarters in Eastleigh, Hampshire, the customer call centre has had a busy month, with a 60% increase in call volumes compared to last April, and 40% more applications for interest free loans. Sasha Dixon leads the extra care team dealing with the most vulnerable customers, and says it's been a very difficult few weeks. ""I've been with Utilita for seven years, and on this team since it started and this is the worst I've ever seen it,"" she said.""We've had so many distressing cases. So many desperate customers ringing us needing support. ""We had one customer who phoned us last week who had actually sold all their belongings, just to be able to get money to eat. They had nothing left to sell and were waiting on a benefit payment,"" she added. Utilita's founder and chief executive, Bill Bullen, said April had been a ""genuine shock"" for household budgets and that the price rises have had an immediate impact.  Like Citizens Advice, the company has seen a rising number of customers not topping up their meters because they're running out of money. He said they were doing everything they could but there was a limit. ""The reality of an energy business today is that it's not a profitable business. There's no spare cash to be spending with customers, and that's the really frustrating thing,"" he said. ""Even in a really good year, you might dream of making a 2% or 3% margin, but that's only around £20 or £30 per customer and what we're seeing here is an increase in bills of around £1,500 a year. ""There's no way that supply companies can even begin to address this problem by themselves. It's way out of our league,"" he added. Mr Bullen said it was great the government was providing energy bill and council tax rebates, but it was nowhere near focussed enough.  ""If they had spent £9bn on the 10 million lowest income households, I think they would have made a bigger dent in the problem,"" he said. ""Instead of having £200 for every household, you could have had £600 for the lowest third of households."" He said everyone in the industry was 100% focussed on how they were going to get customers through the next winter. ""I think the shock in October is going to be huge. We are definitely going to see things like unnecessary increased deaths during the winter period, and just genuine hardship. People don't have that extra £1,500,"" he said. But with high demand for gas around the world continuing as countries move away from Russian supplies, he's not optimistic that prices will come down significantly any time soon. ""Everybody's hoping this is going to be relatively short lived, but the supply and demand balance to me suggests this is something that's going to go on for years, rather than months,"" he said."
Volatility,Magnum-maker's profits soar after it raises prices,2024-09-25,2023-07-25,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-66299138,"Magnum and Marmite-maker Unilever has reported profits soared over the first six months of this year, based almost entirely on raising its prices. The consumer goods giant said that across the business, pre-tax profit rose 21% to €3.9bn (£3.34bn) but the number of goods that it sold fell.  Supermarkets, such as Tesco, have been critical of suppliers lifting their prices amid high inflation. Unilever's boss said it had not passed on higher costs to its customers. Chief executive Hein Schumacher added that he believes that inflation - the rate at which prices rise - had peaked.  ""We do see inflation moderating by the end of the year and that will lead to more moderated pricing our end. ""We've seen high volatility because of drought in Europe and rice shortages in India, as well as geopolitical issues so we've had a lot to contend with,"" he said, referring to the costs the company has to pay for raw materials. Supermarkets, who themselves have been accused of so-called ""greedflation"" - exploiting high inflation to increase their profits - have accused suppliers of hiking prices. So too have some trade unions. ""Unilever's profits are greedflation in action,"" said Sharon Graham, general secretary of the Unite union. ""This isn't about the company shifting more stock - sales volumes have fallen."" But Mr Schumacher said: ""We have not passed inflation on to customers and as you can see we have felt higher costs through lower margins as a group."" A profit margin is calculated by taking away all the costs of doing business, such as wages and energy bills, from the total sales a company generates. Unilever's profit margin edged higher to 17.1% in the six months to June compared with a year ago, but is lower than margins seen pre-pandemic. In 2019 the figure hovered around 19% for the company. According to analyst Emma-Lou Montgomery, associate director at the stockbrokers Fidelity Investment, it is clear that higher prices are boosting Unilever's profits, particularly with sales volumes largely flat.  ""All in all, the cost of living is proving profitable for this global giant, with full-year underlying sales growth expected to beat forecasts,"" she added.  A recent investigation into grocers' pricing by the regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority, said it had found no evidence of profiteering by supermarkets but said it was important to keep the market ""under review"" and would now look into the wider supply chain.  Overall, Unilever's total turnover rose by 2.7% to €30.4bn.  The number of goods - or volume - that Unilever sold fell by 2.5% in the six months to the end of June but its prices rose by 11.2%. Only its personal care, and beauty and wellbeing divisions - which includes luxury make-up brands such as Hourglass - saw volumes rise over the six months.  Food costs have been one of the biggest drivers behind high UK inflation, which measures the pace at which prices are rising. In the year to June, food and soft drink price inflation slowed to 17.4% but remains close to historically high levels. Overall UK inflation eased to 7.9% in June, said the Office for National Statistics.  Last week, Premier Foods, the maker of Mr Kipling cakes and Oxo stock cubes, said it believed recent input cost inflation was ""past its peak"". It added that it would not raise prices for the rest of the year."
Volatility,Energy prices could vary at different times of day,2024-09-25,2024-03-25,Kevin Peachey,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68655725,"Domestic energy prices could be capped based on the time of day that households use their appliances, the regulator Ofgem has said. The watchdog said it has launched early discussions about a ""dynamic"" price cap that changes as consumers became more flexible. It said it would become harder to retain a universal price cap that is suitable for everyone. So it is considering a range of options for changing the current system. At present, Ofgem fixes the maximum price that can be charged for each unit of energy on a standard - or default - tariff for a typical dual-fuel household which pays by direct debit. That affects about 29 million households in England, Wales and Scotland. The annual energy bill for a household using a typical amount of energy will fall to £1,690 from April to the lowest for two years - and down £238 a year from now. Ofgem said the price cap had worked well to protect customers from the ""loyalty penalty"", where customers on default tariffs paid higher prices, and from the worst of the recent volatility seen in the wholesale energy sector. But it said habits and the market were changing as increasing numbers of consumers changed the way they consumed energy and began using electric vehicles, heat pumps and solar panels. A new price cap would need to be flexible for tariffs that allowed price differences if appliances switched on when there is lower demand for energy such as in the night, or when there is more supply from renewables such as when the wind blows. Tim Jarvis, Ofgem's director general of retail and markets, said: ""We recognise the systems we have in place may need to change too. ""We're looking in detail at the elements of the price cap that have worked well and the challenges we've identified in recent years, while also considering how a wide range of future consumers will use and pay for energy to make sure we develop the right measures that will protect and benefit consumers across the board."" Other options included: Mr Jarvis said there would be widespread consultation and the regulator's aim was to ensure the market worked for everyone.  It is impossible to say at this stage how prices would change compared with now for different households if any of these ideas were taken on.  There has been some experimentation with tariffs that vary according to when energy is used. Some households have been offered discounts to use less electricity at peak times in an attempt to ease demand during cold snaps. Simon Virley, head of energy and natural resources at global business services firm KPMG UK, said that while the existing price cap had saved money for customers, this had ""come at a price"". He said it meant ""effective competition and innovation in the market suffering and switching levels falling off a cliff"". ""As we look to what a future retail energy market looks like - it will be key to balance proportionate consumer protection with incentives for investment and innovation in a smarter energy system that benefits all consumers,"" he added."
Volatility,When will we start seeing energy bill deals again?,2024-09-25,2023-05-25,Vishala Sri-Pathma & Daniel Thomas,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-65712145,"Since gas and electricity prices soared in the UK last year, fixed energy deals have all but disappeared as an option for households. But with bills due to drop from July, could they be about to make a comeback? Under the new price cap - which is the maximum price suppliers can charge customers per unit of gas and electricity - a typical household will pay £2,074 a year for gas and electricity from July. That is £426 a year less than what they pay now, although still far higher than what we saw before the energy crisis. So far, most big suppliers have said they will bring their tariffs in line with the new cap but none have set out cheaper fixed deals for customers. Such deals have effectively been off the table since the government stepped in to subsidise bills with its Energy Price Guarantee in October, holding them at £2,500 a year for the average household.  Suppliers have claimed they are not able to offer more competitive pricing plans, and so consumers have not been able to shop around. However, Natalie Mathie, an energy expert at the switching site Uswitch.com, believes the fall in the price cap will be ""a watershed moment"" for suppliers, ""who can now look to start offering fixed deals again given the market conditions"". ""The majority of homes are on standard variable tariffs and now subject to the volatility of price cap changes every three months,"" she says.  ""But customers should have the choice of whether to lock in the benefits of lower wholesale prices for 12 months, just as they do in the mortgage market.  ""We see no reason why energy suppliers cannot offer competitive fixed deals around the £2,000 level."" Emily Seymour, of consumer group Which?, thinks we could start seeing such deals some time this year.  ""We hope to see consumers back able to make some choices,"" she said.  ""It will be worth doing a bit of research to see if there's a deal out there that could be cost effective while also offering good customer service and low exit fees."" However, she says it will depend on where energy prices go next, with fixed deals less likely if the cap has to go up again.  Others meanwhile warn that fixed deals may not be best for everyone given the uncertainty over future prices.  For example, energy supplier Ovo launched a fixed deal for existing customers in March that was cheaper than the government's limit on household bills.  It offered a fixed 12-month tariff of £2,275 for existing customers, but anyone who signed up is now locked into that rate, meaning they will miss out when the new cap comes into effect. Martin Lewis, from personal finance website Money Saving Expert, has also questioned just how much choice consumers will get when fixed deals finally return.  ""I am expecting to see existing customer offers - where you will get a bespoke offer from your firm rather than deals offered across the market,"" he told BBC Radio 4. This could stifle competition, he warned, as the rules say companies do not have to publish the details of their existing customer offers.  ""It makes it very hard for people like me to assess,"" he said.  In any event, the energy analysts Cornwall Insight have suggested consumers should not expect to see huge savings from deals that do emerge.  That is because further substantial falls in energy prices will be unlikely, particularly if there is a cold winter in Europe, with the UK competing to buy gas and electricity with other countries. ""Our forecasts suggest until the end of this decade, higher and more volatile prices are going to be seen, and that includes the impact they're going to have on domestic bills unfortunately,"" Cornwall analyst Kate Mulvany told the BBC. Energy suppliers should be in touch in the coming weeks to let customers know what their bill will look like under the new cap. However, Ms Seymour says it is always worth having a conversation with your supplier about any bespoke deals they can offer you.  If you find yourself struggling to pay bills, consumer experts suggest speaking to your energy supplier about a payment plan that is manageable. By paying what you can - even if it's less than the amount due - your arrears will grow more slowly and your supplier is likely to be less worried about your debt. Your supplier could also check if you qualify for any government schemes.  It's also important to check the amount you pay each month if you use a direct debit.  Your monthly payment is based on your estimated usage through the year not what you actually use so keep a close eye and update your supplier with your meter readings.

Volatility,British Gas owner warns energy bills to stay high,2024-09-25,2023-06-30,Simon Jack,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-66051560,"Energy bills are likely to stay high for the foreseeable future, according to the boss of the company that owns British Gas. Centrica chief executive Chris O'Shea said while he believes the worst of the energy crisis is over, risks remain. A new price cap comes into effect this weekend which will see households with typical energy usage pay £2,074. Mr O'Shea said prices have fallen from the rise caused by the Russian war, but are higher than the long-term average. ""I think the first act of the crisis is over,"" he said. ""I think what we've got to remember is the energy prices had more than doubled before Russia invaded Ukraine.  ""Now, prices are back down to pre-invasion levels but they're still two and a half times the long run average.""  Gas and electricity bills will fall below the £2,500 level that was subsidised by the government under its Energy Price Guarantee scheme. However, under the new price cap, which is set by the regulator Ofgem, households bills will remain £800 more expensive than two years ago. Meanwhile, Cornwall Insight, a consultancy firm, estimates that changes in the price cap - which limits what companies can charge per unit of gas and electricity -  will take energy bills for a typical consumer to £1,871 per year from October.  That is then forecast to rise to £1,900 from January. Mr O'Shea was speaking to the BBC as Centrica announced it was doubling the amount of gas stored in its Rough storage facility off the coast of Yorkshire ahead of this winter.   Despite the extra storage, he said there was a danger that the UK risked being complacent about the resilience of the country's energy supplies which were still vulnerable to external shocks.  ""I think that there's a danger that we get complacent because last winter was okay and because prices are quite stable now,"" he said. ""But when we had trouble between the Wagner group and the Russian military last week we saw energy prices go up by about 20%. Chinese economic activity at the moment is relatively low. If that starts to pick up we'll see more demand for gas in the form of LNG [Liquified Natural Gas], then we'll see European gas prices go up so there could be more volatility to come.""  The UK has some of the lowest gas storage levels in Europe.   The Rough storage facility, which is 18 miles off the coast of Yorkshire, was effectively mothballed in 2016 as new gas and electricity connections to Europe meant it was considered redundant. It was brought back into partial service last October with three days' worth of the UK's average gas usage pumped in. From Friday, that will be doubled to six days' worth, bringing the UK's total reserves to 12 days.   ""There is nowhere near enough gas storage, it could be more resilient,"" said Mr O'Shea. ""But it's far better than it was. So we've doubled the capacity and we should really not lose sight of that this makes a huge difference."" In contrast, Germany has reserves of 90 days, France has 103 days and the Netherlands has 123 days' worth of gas. Centrica said it would like to see Rough's capacity increased to 27 days' worth but that would require £2bn of investment which in turn, Mr O'Shea said, would require a government subsidy through a special pricing structure.   Looking ahead to winter, the Centrica boss acknowledged that many customers would find it difficult to pay energy bills at a time of rising food and housing costs. British Gas came under fire earlier this year when The Times newspaper revealed that a contractor working for the company was force-fitting pre-payment meters in vulnerable customers' homes.  Force-fitting pre-payment meters was suspended across the industry for a time. They can now be fitted again but Ofgem said customers must be given more chance to clear debts and forced meter fittings are banned in homes with residents all aged over 85. Centrica is the subject of an ongoing Ofgem investigation. The company has brought its debt collection activities in-house but Mr O'Shea said there was still a problem in telling the difference between those who would not pay and those who genuinely couldn't. He suggested the answer was to introduce a social tariff for the neediest customers funded from general taxation.   ""The government support that was put in place with the energy price guarantee was incredibly helpful for people but it wasn't targeted,"" he said. ""So it helped the richest as much as it helped the poorest in society.  ""What we'd like to see is a social tariff put in place for those that need help most get the help most and those that don't get no help whatsoever.""

He was speaking after leaders of energy-intensive industries met with Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng. ""We can't wait until Christmas and beyond. Or even a few weeks. We need action now, it needs to be swift, decisive action,"" Mr Stace said. The government said it was exploring ways to manage high energy costs. Gas prices have risen 250% since January, pushing up costs dramatically. Mr Stace told the BBC that Mr Kwarteng had listened but had provided ""no immediate solutions or guarantees"". The UK Steel director general said he was ""baffled"" because governments in the rest of Europe had stepped in to support industry, although they faced lower energy costs than in the UK. Representatives from energy-intensive sectors including paper, glass, cement, lime, ceramics, chemicals and steel were at Friday's talks with the business secretary. The Energy Intensive Users Group (EIUG) said it hoped the government would find ways to support those sectors. Mr Kwarteng told the business representatives he would continue to work with them to tackle the problem.  His department said the government would assess the options put forward by the industry, with his spokesperson saying: ""We recognise the recent increase in global gas prices will be a cause of concern for businesses in the UK. ""We are in regular contact with Ofgem and business groups to explore ways to manage the impact of rising global prices."" Mr Kwarteng also stressed government confidence in the security of gas supplies this winter. After the meeting, EIUG chair Richard Leese said the government had made ""positive first steps to develop practical solutions"". ""EIUG will work with government to avoid threats both to the production of essential domestic and industrial products, as well an enormous range of supply chains critical to our economy,"" he said. Andrew Large, director-general at the Confederation of Paper Industries, said there were ""serious"" risks factories could stop operating as a result of the gas prices being too high. There have already been stoppages at fertiliser and steel plants due to high energy costs. However, he said the business secretary appeared to share industry's desire to avoid any potential supply chain disruption. On Thursday Mr Kwarteng said the government's strategy to shift to ""clean"" power sources by 2035, including wind, solar and nuclear, would reduce reliance on fossil fuels. ""The volatility of the gas price has shown we do need to plan strategically and net zero helps us do that,"" he said. Speaking before the meeting, Mr Stace had said if the government failed to act it could ""strangle steel production"" in the UK. A crisis in steel production as a result of high energy prices would affect the wider economy, he added, saying the government should consider taking additional action in the short term. ""We're pausing production already in terms of some steel producers in the UK.... and it's going to happen more often unless something is done, or the energy market corrects itself and I don't think that will happen any time soon."" He said the government should address the disparity in energy costs for UK steel makers who he said were paying 50-80% more for electricity than German producers. Other countries, such as Italy and Portugal, had ""committed billions of euros"" to address the rising cost of gas, he added.  ""If the government does nothing then tomorrow, there'll be a steel crisis, and given in terms of what impact that could have on jobs, then that wouldn't be good, not only for the steel sector, for those regions where steel is, but for the UK economy as a whole,"" he said. The price of wholesale gas has soared since the start of the year. And the UK has lower levels of gas stored than other European countries, which could help cushion price volatility. Domestic customers' bills are partly protected from these sharp rises by a price cap, managed by the regulator Ofgem, which limits how far and how fast bills can rise. Nevertheless, UK households have felt the impact after the price cap was raised at the start of October. Customers will see further ""significant rises"" in the spring, regulator Ofgem has warned. The cap is revised twice a year and is next due to be changed in April. It applies to households in England, Scotland and Wales this month. Households in Northern Ireland have also seen a recent sharp rise in their bills, but they are not protected by the energy price cap for Great Britain."
Volatility,Firms warn of price rises as energy costs soar,2024-09-25,2021-10-06,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-58824121,"High energy costs are forcing manufacturers to warn of higher prices for their goods as they pass on increases to consumers. Iceland boss Richard Walker said higher energy bills and other costs meant price rises were now ""inevitable"". The warning came as analysts predicted that household energy bills could rise by hundreds of pounds next year. They said the energy price cap, which protects domestic consumers, could soar by £400 in the spring. Cornwall Insight forecasts that the energy price cap will rise to about £1,660 by next summer. That is about 30% higher than the record £1,277 level for the cap set for winter 2021-22, which began at the start of October. ""With wholesale gas and electricity prices continuing to reach new records, successive supplier exits during September 2021 and a new level for the default tariff cap, the Great British energy market remains on edge for fresh volatility and further consolidation,"" said Craig Lowrey, senior consultant at Cornwall Insight. Energy regulator Ofgem said the price cap ""will ensure that consumers don't pay more than is absolutely necessary this winter"". But if gas prices stay high, the price cap will rise, Ofgem said. The regulator said its ""number one priority is to protect customers"", but acknowledged ""this is a worrying time for many people"".  But while the price cap helps households, there is no such safeguard for businesses, which have to absorb the full impact of rising global energy prices. Mr Walker warned that Iceland's energy bill would go up by £20m next year. Alongside higher salaries to address lorry driver shortages and other new costs, he said grocery prices would have to increase. ""It's inevitable that we will see price rises,"" he told the BBC. ""The UK supermarket industry is one of the most competitive in the world.  ""Our margins are very very tight and we're not an endless sponge that can just absorb all of these different cost increases."" Andrew Large, director general of the Confederation of Paper Industries, said: ""This is a highly inflationary situation for the British economy and members will clearly be in a position where they do try to pass those costs on to consumers where they can."" One paper manufacturer, the Northwood Group, said the industry had been ""left to fend for itself"" in the face of ""horrendous"" knock-on effects from the gas price rise. ""The spike [in gas prices] that we have seen since January is equivalent to a 550% price increase, which of course destroys any industrial planning,"" said chairman Paul Fecher. Laura Cohen, chief executive of the British Ceramic Confederation, said many of her member firms could even be forced to stop production ""due to uneconomic higher energy costs"". This could cause ""severe damage"" to production facilities such as brick kilns, which could not easily be turned off at short notice, she said. Meanwhile, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has said that by decarbonising the UK's power supply, the country will protect customers from volatile fossil fuel prices. ""The UK so far, as many of you know, has made great progress in diversifying our energy mix. But we are still very dependent, perhaps too dependent, on fossil fuels and their volatile prices,"" he told a conference organised by trade body Energy UK. He said that the government's recent pledge to decarbonise the electricity grid by 2035 - 15 years ahead of the previous target - would help. ""Our homes and businesses will be powered by affordable, clean and secure electricity generated here in the UK, for people in the UK,"" Mr Kwarteng said. The Energy Shop - a price comparison site - warned people to prepare themselves for even greater increases in household bills. It said that the next increase in the price cap, due to come in from 1 April 2022, could be £500 or even higher. Founder Joe Malinowski warned: ""If things don't settle down soon, increases of £600, £700 or even £800 cannot be ruled out."" Nine energy suppliers have already collapsed in recent weeks and more could be facing the same fate. They were unable to keep their price promises as the wholesale price of gas soared.  Their customers have already seen annual bill increases of hundreds of pounds when they moved to a new provider and away from whichever low-rate fixed deal their supplier had offered. Some of the heat was drawn from the crisis on Wednesday when Russia said it would increase gas supplies to Europe. UK wholesale gas prices hit a record high during the day before falling after the Russian intervention. But price volatility could continue as investors remain nervous about low stockpiles of gas across Europe. If you feel powerless against international business and politics when watching your domestic energy bill go up, you are in good company. Normally, customers are urged to get active, search and switch to save money - but not now. Until recently, the energy price cap was a backstop, protecting the vulnerable. Now it is the most competitive tariff available. The cap is shielding households from the wild fluctuation in prices seen on the wholesale markets, but that is only a crumb of comfort when bills and prices across the board are still expected to see a sharp increase. So for now, experts simply advise customers to find ways to save energy, brace themselves and budget for bigger bills. Wrap up for a financial chill that could last longer than the winter. The energy price cap sets the maximum price suppliers in England, Wales and Scotland can charge customers on a standard - or default - tariff. That includes the fixed daily amount customers pay, plus the price per unit they pay for electricity and gas. The cap was increased on 1 October, with about 15 million households facing a 12% rise in energy bills, the biggest jump, to the highest amount, seen since the backstop was introduced in January 2019. Those on standard tariffs, with typical household levels of energy use, saw an increase of £139 - from £1,138 to £1,277 a year. Prepayment meter customers with average energy use saw a £153 increase. That's a far cry from a year previously when on 1 October 2020, the energy price cap was cut by £84, to £1,042. Will you be affected by rising energy prices?

Volatility,Urgent action needed on energy prices - Ovo boss,2024-09-25,2021-12-27,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-59797224,"The government is showing ""nowhere near enough urgency"" in finding a solution to steep increases in gas and electricity prices, one energy boss has told the BBC.  Ovo's boss Stephen Fitzpatrick predicts the rise in wholesale gas prices and its impact on people will be ""an enormous crisis for 2022"". The business secretary met with Ofgem and energy firms on Monday. The government says it wants to make sure households are protected. A spokeswoman for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said the meeting was ""to discuss the ongoing effects of record high global gas prices on the sector"".   ""Throughout the meeting there was discussion of the issues facing the sector and an agreement for meetings to continue over the coming days and weeks to ensure UK consumers are protected,"" she said. It is understood that representatives from the Treasury and Number 10 were also present.  Mr Fitzpatrick, who attended the virtual meeting, said his priority was for the government and the regulator to understand how critical the situation is. He said the main worry was how consumers would be supported through price increases.   ""We've seen this energy crisis unfold now for the last three months and we've watched as energy prices have spiked, fallen back, and spiked again,"" he said. ""We've had more than 30 bankruptcies in the sector, we've had millions of customers forced to change supplier.  ""The cost to the consumer has already been more than £4bn. We haven't seen any action from the government or from the regulator. There's an acceptance that there's a problem, but nowhere near enough urgency to find a solution,"" he added. He pointed to the example of some European governments that have helped consumers in their countries. In recent months, wholesale gas prices have risen to unprecedented levels. Last week, they hit a new record of 450p per therm, which experts think could take average annual gas bills to about £2,000 next year.  On Thursday, Energy UK, the industry's trade body, warned bills could soar by another 50% unless the government intervened.  The meeting between Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng and the energy industry has taken place at a time when the sector is facing an unprecedented situation.  The prices paid by suppliers for the gas and electricity they sell on to consumers have risen dramatically in recent weeks. Because household bills are capped by the regulator Ofgem, they have been unable to pass the extra costs to their customers immediately, and dozens have gone out of business.  Nor are consumers themselves immune. The price cap is due to be raised in the spring, and very steep increases are expected. Against this background, energy firms have been demanding radical action, such as cuts in taxes and environmental levies to bring down bills for vulnerable consumers, as well as changes to the way in which the price cap itself operates.  Against this background, today's meeting is likely to be one of many over the coming days and weeks. Mr Fitzpatrick said: ""It is already households' largest single bill to pay and it is going to double that. And I think expecting consumers to shoulder that kind of volatility without any kind of support from government is just unrealistic."" More than 20 energy companies have collapsed since wholesale prices started to spike, unable to pay high prices or pass the increased cost on to consumers. Nearly four million customers have been affected. Consumers are protected from big rises in wholesale costs by a price cap set by the regulator Ofgem. However, the cap is due to change in April. Mr Fitzpatrick said it was important ""we don't waste any more time"" addressing the rising cost of household energy. ""It is a really good sign of just how urgent everything is that we're meeting between Christmas and New Year to work this out,"" he said. ""But we really have to take the opportunity today.""  Labour has urged the government to use the money raised through higher than expected VAT receipts, driven by the higher cost of food and energy prices, to cut household energy bills.  Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said Labour wanted the government to immediately announce the removal of VAT from household heating bills over winter. ""We need a sustainable and ambitious approach to energy,"" she said.  Mr Fitzpatrick also suggested the government could consider ""taking away some of the environmental social policy costs that we have seen increase over the years and it may mean that we need some kind of price smoothing mechanism from the government"". ""These are all things that we are going to be discussing today,"" he said. The government said: ""We regularly engage with the energy industry and will continue to ensure that consumers are protected through the Energy Price Cap, which is insulating millions from record global gas prices."""
Volatility,Larne Lough gas storage project 'gets green light',2024-09-25,2021-10-13,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-58896311,"A marine licence has been granted for a plan to develop gas storage caverns underneath Larne Lough, according to the company behind it. The project near Islandmagee, would see seven large gas storage caverns hollowed out under the lough. Islandmagee Energy said the project would provide security of supply during peak demand for up to 14 days. Northern Ireland's main conservation groups have previously opposed the plan on environmental grounds. Harland and Wolff Group Holdings plc, Harland and Wolff's owner, is the firm behind the project. Its chief executive, John Wood, said the latest announcement was ""good news for consumers and businesses in the UK who are currently experiencing distressing hikes in energy prices"". ""With the current energy supply crisis, everyone now understands just how important gas storage is to secure supply and protect against extreme volatility in gas and power prices in the UK,"" he said. ""We are delighted with this major step forward in the project's journey, paving the way for the construction of our facilities."" The firm said on Wednesday that 400 direct jobs will be created, during construction and that Islandmagee Energy also has longer-term ambitions to store hydrogen.  ""The existing power grid cannot always accept all of the electricity generated from wind farms during periods of surplus wind power generation,"" he added. ""It is during these frequently-occurring periods that wind farms are temporarily scaled back as there is no way to store the excess electricity produced.  ""Production of large-scale hydrogen and its storage is the long-term solution to this.  ""Excess wind generated power can be used to produce green hydrogen which can then be stored in salt caverns for future use during peak demand periods."" Last year, Mr Wood said it had completed a ""robust series of surveys and studies"", which had been sent to Stormont departments. The project would see seven large storage caverns hollowed out using solution mining. The brine solution created would be pumped across land before being discharged into the North Channel near Islandmagee in County Antrim. The sea at Islandmagee is a protected area, as is Larne Lough which supports tern colonies. An umbrella group, the Northern Ireland Marine Task Force, representing a range of conservation organisations had previously said they were against the pumping of ""super saline brine"" into the sea and that construction of the discharge pipe could displace marine life, especially the protected harbour porpoise. On Wednesday, the chairman of Marine Conservation Northern Ireland, Nigel Hamilton, expressed his ""grave concern"" over the proposal. The North Channel is considered one of the best habitats for marine life in the UK. High energy costs have led manufacturers across the UK to warn of higher prices for their goods as they pass on increases to consumers. Other firms have said they may be forced to shut down factories if the rising cost of gas and electricity makes it uneconomic for them to produce their goods."
Volatility,Winter energy bills drop slightly but remain high,2024-09-25,2023-08-24,Kevin Peachey,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-66607005,"An annual energy bill for a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity will fall to £1,923 in October under regulator Ofgem's new price cap. Bills will be £151 lower than current rates and £577 down on last winter. But many people will see little difference in what they pay despite the fall because some government support has been withdrawn. Charities said the government must protect the most vulnerable households.  Average annual gas and electricity bills remain high by historical standards. In winter 2021, an energy bill for a typical household was £1,277.  Analysts also suggest that prices could rise again at the start of next year. Ofgem chief executive Jonathan Brearley said: ""We know people are struggling with the wider cost of living challenges and I can't offer any certainty that things will ease this winter.""  Volatility in the market gave little long-term certainty to customers, he said. Ofgem's price cap affects 29 million households in England, Wales and Scotland. It sets the maximum amount that suppliers can charge for each unit of gas and electricity but not the total bill. If you use more, you will pay more. For a home using a typical amount of gas and electricity and paying by direct debit, the current annual bill is £2,074. This will fall to £1,923 between 1 October and 31 December. Specifically, the price of gas will fall from 7.5p per kilowatt hour (kWh) now to 6.89p for the final three months of the year. The price of electricity will fall from 30.1p per kWh to 27.35p. The typical bill is calculated on an estimate that the average household uses 2,900 kWh of electricity and 12,000 kWh of gas. Those who pay bills every three months, often by cheque - known as standard credit - will pay £129 more a year than those using direct debit. Domestic energy bills will be lower than the £2,500 a year paid last winter and spring, when the government stepped in to limit further rises. Prices rose following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.   But last winter's government-funded £400 discount to every household, which was paid in six instalments between October and March, has finished and will not be repeated. Adam Scorer, from charity National Energy Action, said costs would be higher for many if the weather is colder than last year. ""Millions will still face unaffordable bills this winter and we are concerned about a mood of complacency. Government must remain laser focused on the risk of vulnerable households struggling in cold homes this winter,"" he said. Citizens Advice called for more targeted government support for those who need it most. The charity said the number of people getting in contact for advice about paying energy bills jumped by 17% in the first half of this year.   Ofgem's Mr Brearley said that social tariffs, for lower-income households, should be considered as a future option. Asked about families being concerned they will again struggle to pay their bills this winter, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said the government was working ""night and day to ensure the money in people's pockets goes further"". ""I want to make sure the most vulnerable in our society do get help, even when prices are coming down,"" he said. Meanwhile, households are paying more for standing charges, which are a fixed daily payment covering the costs of supply and other levies. They are also capped and part of the typical energy bill but, because they are fixed, consumers have no way of reducing them even if they cut back on energy use. Ofgem officials said that the latest rise was the result of a higher rate of inflation. That meant suppliers' operating costs, such as running call centres, were higher. Mr Brearley said that it was difficult to shift some of these costs onto usage prices.  The average standing charge for electricity will be 53.37p per day from October. For gas customers, it will be 29.62p per day.  Jay Cross, who runs a barbers shop, said he and his wife Andrea found their direct debits were failing to cover their bills last year.  ""We ran over on the bills and then made payment plans to catch up with it,"" he said.  ""We've got no choice, we've got to have the heating on - especially with the baby. We're still in arrears but we are going to get back on top of it ready for this winter.""  Analysts suggest domestic energy bills are unlikely to fall significantly for the next decade. Shadow climate change secretary Ed Miliband said higher energy bills were ""here to stay"" and that Labour would bring in a ""proper windfall tax"". Meanwhile, Liberal Democrat MP Wera Hobhouse said high bills reflected a ""shocking failure"" by ministers. Cost-of-living payments will continue to be made to people on lower incomes and those receiving certain benefits to help with high bills.

Volatility,A million more will struggle to pay energy bills,2024-09-25,2021-10-07,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-58831110,"More than a million extra British households won't be able to afford to heat and power their homes next spring, according to a charity. Energy bills are expected to rise again in April to reflect the rising wholesale price of gas. National Energy Action says 1.2 million to 1.5 million additional households will be plunged into fuel poverty. Households that spend a high proportion of their income on energy bills are considered to be in fuel poverty. At the start of October the energy price cap, which limits the impact of rising energy prices on households in England, Scotland and Wales, was raised to take the sharply rising wholesale gas price into account. But Ofgem, the energy regulator, said the price cap would have to rise again next year if wholesale gas prices continue to go up. Analysts said this could mean a typical customer paying between £400 and £600 more per year.  Households in Northern Ireland have also seen a recent sharp rise in their bills, but they aren't protected by the energy price cap for Great Britain. If you feel powerless against international business and politics when watching your domestic energy bill go up, you are in good company. Normally, customers are urged to get active, search and switch to save money - but not now. Until recently, the energy price cap was a backstop, protecting the vulnerable.

So for now, experts simply advise customers to find ways to save energy, brace themselves and budget for bigger bills. Wrap up for a financial chill that could last longer than the winter. National Energy Action (NEA) said this month's price rises had already pushed half a million more households into fuel poverty. ""It's building into a brutal and bleak winter for millions. If the price cap goes up by £400 to £600 a year it could plunge 1.2 to 1.5 million households into fuel poverty, leaving almost 5.5 million households struggling to keep their homes warm and safe,"" said NEA chief executive Adam Scorer. NEA is calling for more support to be put in place for low income households. Ofgem, the energy regulator, said it expected prices would rise further in April.  Its chief executive Jonathan Brearley said the energy cap was ""designed to reflect fair costs and therefore will need to adjust over time"". Natural gas prices are at record highs as economies around the world begin to recover from the Covid crisis.  As a result, firms that supply gas to householders are running into trouble because they have agreed to sell energy at less than the price it now costs them to buy it. Even with the raising of the cap this month Mr Brearley said more energy firms could run into difficulties. ""Given the continued volatility in the market, it is likely more suppliers will exit the market,"" he told an energy conference on Thursday. Nine firms have already gone out of business, forcing 1.7 million customers to move to new suppliers. Those households have already seen annual bill increases of hundreds of pounds, since new providers aren't able to match lower-rate fixed deals that were on offer when gas prices were lower. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng, who was also attending the conference, said the right response to rising gas prices was to renew the UK's commitment to renewable energy. The government recently pledged to shift electricity generation away from fossil fuels entirely by 2035. ""The UK so far, as many of you know, has made great progress in diversifying our energy mix. But we are still very dependent, perhaps too dependent, on fossil fuels and their volatile prices,"" he said. Decarbonising heating and power would mean lower prices he said.  ""Our homes and businesses will be powered by affordable, clean and secure electricity generated here in the UK, for people in the UK,"" Mr Kwarteng said. However, customers will question whether the cost of the making the transition to lower carbon energy could push bills higher in the short term. The next revision to the energy price cap will be decided by Ofgem in February but will come into force in April. Analysts Cornwall Insight said that the cap could go up by £400 meaning that a household with typical energy use would pay around £1,660 a year. However the Energy Shop - a price comparison site - warned people to prepare themselves for even greater increases in household bills. It said that the next increase in the price cap could be £500 or even higher. Founder Joe Malinowski warned: ""If things don't settle down soon, increases of £600, £700 or even £800 cannot be ruled out."" Businesses are also feeling the impact of rising energy costs. Firms are warning that could lead to higher prices for their goods as increases are passed on to consumers. Richard Walker, managing director of supermarket chain Iceland, said steep rises in energy bills and other costs meant price rises were now ""inevitable"". ""The UK supermarket industry is one of the most competitive in the world,"" he told the BBC. ""Our margins are very tight and we're not an endless sponge that can just absorb all of these different cost increases."" Mark Nicholson and his business partner set up their firm Harvey George Furniture four years ago in Hull. Today they employ about 30 people making bespoke bathroom and bedroom furniture.  The past 18 months have been so good that they've moved premises to expand - and invested about £500,000 in new technology and machinery to keep up with demand. ""It's a gas guzzler - unfortunately for us it's a big gas guzzler,"" he says of their new painting machine, which is piped into the mains and is able to produce colourful furniture much faster.  ""Any business, it's about cost and quite a big component for us is energy, so it's quite a scary thought. Our last bill was £8,000 - it was a shock. ""We'll keep going. But we could just do with some stability on our costs. It feels like everything - rates, recruitment, materials, shipping - now energy... feels very up and down.""  The energy price cap sets the maximum price suppliers in England, Wales and Scotland can charge customers on a standard - or default - tariff. That includes the fixed daily amount customers pay, plus the price per unit they pay for electricity and gas. When the cap was increased on 1 October, about 15 million households faced a 12% rise in energy bills, the biggest jump, to the highest amount, seen since the backstop was introduced in January 2019.

Volatility,'Lives at risk' as energy price cap soars by 80%,2024-09-25,2022-08-25,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-62674301,"Lives will be at risk this winter, experts and charities have warned, after the energy regulator hiked the price cap on household bills by 80%. A typical household gas and electricity bill will rise to £3,549 a year from October, Ofgem announced on Friday. Save the Children said young people's health was at risk and money expert Martin Lewis predicted grave consequences without more state help. Pressure is growing on Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak to outline further support. The two Conservative Party leadership candidates have both pledged more direct support for households struggling with surging gas and electricity bills. But neither have given much detail on what they plan to do ahead of a new party leader - and prime minister - being announced on 5 September. The rise in the energy price cap - which is the maximum amount that suppliers can charge households per unit of energy - means millions of households will see their annual bills rise from about £1,971 currently. Typical prepayment meter customers will also see their bills rise to £3,608. Labour has accused Ms Truss and Mr Sunak of having ""almost nothing to say"" about the huge spike in energy cost. Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi acknowledged after the announcement of the new cap that ""we know we need to do more"", and ""more help is on its way"". He also suggested people should cut down on how much energy they used.  ""The reality is that we should all look at our energy consumption. It is a difficult time. There is war on our continent,"" he said. In his meetings with energy generation firms this week, the Chancellor also said energy companies needed to do more to support their customers, rather than relying on customers changing their behaviour or expecting the government alone to help consumers.  During these meetings, companies also acknowledged they needed to do more. The increase in consumers' bills follows sharp rises in wholesale gas largely due to the conflict in Ukraine, which has reduced supplies of Russian gas. The government announced in Spring all households will get a £400 rebate on energy bills. It means about £60 will be knocked off energy bills every month for six months. Low income and vulnerable households will receive an additional £650. However, energy prices have soared since that package of measures was revealed, and from October a typical household will see monthly energy bills of nearly £300 a month. Mr Lewis, a personal finance journalist and campaigner, warned without extra government support, some people would face health problems because they would not be able to afford to heat their homes. ""I am begging and praying and pleading that there is more government help this winter so that people do not die,"" he said. Meanwhile, Save the Children's head of child poverty, Becca Lyon, said: ""Children are at serious risk from today's announcement and could spend this winter in cold homes."" Katie Schmuecker, principal policy adviser for the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, a charity which focuses on poverty, added: ""It is simply unthinkable that the price rises announced today can go ahead without further government intervention on a significant scale."" Analysts at Cornwall Insight have predicted the price cap will climb even more, resulting in a typical annual household bill of £5,400 in January before hitting more than £6,600 in April. Jonathan Brearley, chief executive of Ofgem, said the predictions should be treated with caution as the current global volatility affecting gas prices could ""change massively"". But he agreed the next prime minister needed to ""act urgently and decisively to address this"".  He told the BBC: ""All of us, with the government, need to get ahead of this problem and manage it on behalf of customers because the outlook for winter without any action looks very difficult indeed."" Labour and the Liberal Democrats have criticised the government for failing to respond to the growing crisis.  Lib Dem leader Ed Davey said the energy price cap rise was ""nothing short of a catastrophe for millions of families and pensioners"".  Meanwhile, shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said the announcement would ""strike fear in the heart of many families, and force many to make unthinkable choices this winter"". Businesses are not covered by an energy price cap and many face cost pressures that could be passed on to consumers through higher prices. Prices have also been rising in Northern Ireland, where there is no cap owing to the limited number of suppliers. The new energy price cap will drain the disposable income of several million households.  And it is not just an issue which will transform the path of the economy. These rises are so large and so widespread that they could test the nation's social resilience too. Even the energy industry itself doesn't think these rises are possible.   At a recent meeting with the government to discuss the Energy Tariff Deficit Fund, a key takeaway was that not one energy firm believed it is feasible to charge the nation what the companies themselves are having to pay to purchase gas.  That is an amazing and remarkable situation. So that gaping hole, that is getting larger every day, week and month is now in the hands of the government. Anne Southgate is one of the four million households in the UK on a pre-payment meter; for her, Friday's news is very stressful. The 38-year-old from Manchester says the thought of her bills rising by so much this winter is taking its toll on her mental health. ""I have to keep fighting back the tears, I don't want the children to see that,"" she says. Anne is a single mum and full-time student; she's taken on a part-time job to try to make ends meet. She's already making lots of cutbacks and doesn't see what more she can do to bring the cost of her bills down. ""We're going to have to spend more time together in one room, I don't really know what more I can physically do."""
Volatility,Regulator warns of significant energy price hikes,2024-09-25,2021-10-08,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-58840537,"Households will again see ""significant rises"" in energy prices next spring, regulator Ofgem has warned. Its chief executive, Jonathan Brearley, said the price cap, which limits how much energy providers can charge per unit, would go up again because of the ""unprecedented"" rise in gas prices. The cap is revised twice a year and is next due to be changed in April. Natural gas prices are at record highs as economies around the world begin to recover from the Covid crisis.  As a result, firms that supply gas to householders are running into trouble because they have agreed to sell energy at less than the price it now costs them to buy it. Last month, nine of those companies went out of business, forcing 1.7 million customers to move to new suppliers. Ofgem's Mr Brearley told the BBC that the price cap was there to stop firms making unfair profits, but ""legitimate costs have to be passed through"". He said it was too early to say how much the rise in April would be or whether Ofgem would have to review the price cap more frequently in future. However, he added that the regulator might have to look at the formula according to which the cap was set. His warning comes as domestic customers are still reeling from the latest price cap increase, which took effect for households in England, Scotland and Wales this month. Households in Northern Ireland have also seen a recent sharp rise in their bills, but they are not protected by the energy price cap for Great Britain. The energy crisis falls into three broad stages for UK consumers and businesses. Firstly, the here and now. Domestic customers have seen a rise in direct debit demands and bills from suppliers. They are, however, protected from the extreme cost of gas on the wholesale markets by the price cap. Businesses are not. Many are seeing instant and large increases in their energy bills. Secondly, as Ofgem confirms, significantly higher energy prices in the spring are inevitable, potentially adding hundreds of pounds to an annual household bill. That is something which customers can do nothing to stop. Thirdly, a review by the regulator will consider the extent to which the price cap protects customers versus the extra burden it places on all bill payers picking up the cost if the cap causes suppliers to fold. At any point in this process, the government can step in. Thus far, it has shown little appetite to do so.  When the price cap was increased on 1 October, about 15 million households faced a 12% rise in energy bills. That was the biggest jump, to the highest amount, seen since the backstop was introduced in January 2019. Those on standard tariffs, with typical household levels of energy use, saw an increase of £139 - from £1,138 to £1,277 a year. Prepayment meter customers with average energy use saw a £153 increase. The next revision to the energy price cap will be decided by Ofgem in February, but will come into force in April. Even if wholesale gas prices were to drop significantly from now, the extra costs that suppliers have had to shoulder in the last couple of months means a steep rise in household bills in April is inevitable. Analysts Cornwall Insight said that the cap could go up by £400, meaning that a household with typical energy use would pay about £1,660 a year. On Thursday, National Energy Action, a charity, said that between 1.2 million to 1.5 million additional households could be hit by fuel poverty next year. Meanwhile, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng is to hold talks later on Friday with representatives of industries which have the heaviest energy consumption, such as steel, cement and chemicals.   While the price cap helps households, there is no such safeguard for businesses, which have to absorb the full impact of rising global energy prices. They have called for government help to control costs and keep plants open.   The UK has lower levels of gas stored than many other European countries, making it more exposed to global price volatility. Mr Kwarteng said on Twitter protecting consumers from rising global gas prices was ""his top priority"". His meeting with the Energy Intensive Users Group (EIUG) will include representative bodies UK Steel, the Chemical Industries Association, the Confederation of Paper Industries, the Mineral Products Association, the British Glass Manufacturers Federation, the British Ceramic Confederation, BOC, Air Products and the Major Energy Users Council. Ahead of the meeting, the director of UK Steel, Gareth Stace, told the BBC that the government needed to step in to help industries cope with the rising cost of energy. ""If the government does nothing, then tomorrow there'll be a steel crisis, and in terms of what impact that could have on jobs, then that wouldn't be good, not only for the steel sector, for those regions where steel, is but for the UK economy as a whole,"" he added. Last month, high gas prices forced two fertiliser factories to close, cutting supplies of carbon dioxide which is widely used in food production."
Volatility,Bill shock for millions as energy price rise hits,2024-09-25,2022-03-31,Kevin Peachey,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60943192,"Millions of people will now feel the impact of an unprecedented £700-a-year rise in energy costs - at the same time as a host of bill hikes take effect. The 54% rise in the energy price cap means a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity will now pay £1,971 per year. A further rise pushing the annual bill up to £2,600 should be expected in October, one analyst has told the BBC. Council tax, water bills and car tax are also going up for some on 1 April. Minimum wage rates are rising which, along with some financial support from the government, is partially softening the blow. The £693 a year rise in a typical energy bill will affect 18 million households, with 4.5 million customers on prepayment meters facing an even bigger increase of £708 a year. Among them is Winston Carrington, a grandfather in his 70s, who said he was growing vegetables in the garden of his Manchester home to help ease the impact of the rising cost of living. ""I'm going to grow, and I'm going to fill my freezer this year with my own produce. I'm going to have to,"" said Mr Carrington, who uses a prepayment meter. ""I can't go away this year again, not because of Covid or anything. I just can't afford to go away. The state pension that we're getting at the moment does not cover what I need."" Prices in general are rising at their fastest rate for 30 years, but the sudden increase in the cost of energy is the most significant for individuals.  New official figures suggest four in 10 bill-payers have been finding it very, or somewhat, difficult to afford their energy costs. The governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, said the country is facing the biggest single shock from energy prices since the 1970s. It is the largest increase, by far, in the energy regulator Ofgem's price cap, since it was introduced. The cap, set every six months for England. Wales and Scotland, is designed to protect domestic customers from the volatility of wholesale energy prices. However, official forecasters and analysts have warned people to be braced for another huge rise in energy bills when the next cap takes effect in October. Wholesale prices have been affected by the war in Ukraine and ongoing pressure on suppliers. This could add another £629 to a typical bill in October, according to the most up-to-date prediction, provided to the BBC from leading energy consultancy firm Cornwall Insight. If this proved to be accurate, then the average bill next winter would be double that of the winter just gone. A typical bill is expected to fall back to the current level in summer 2023, although longer-term forecasts are tricky. Are you affected by issues covered in this story?  Bill Bullen, the boss of Utilita, warned that elderly people and children were at serious risk over the next winter because of a lack of heating. ""We are going to see an extra £500 or £600 added to bills in October, and frankly the chancellor's going to have to fund that entirely for low-income households,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. ""He won't be able to afford to take this problem away for everybody... but for customers who can't respond to that price [increase], that's where the help needs to be targeted."" Chris O'Shea, chief executive of Centrica, which owns the UK's largest supplier British Gas, said his business was supporting struggling customers and was giving grants to those most in need. ""We would love to do more. The reality is that for a retail energy company, the market has gone through quite a change, and profits have reduced quite substantially,"" he told the BBC's Big Green Money Show. However, he accepted that profits had risen sharply for the heavily taxed exploration arm of the business. Council taxes and water bills are also going up for many people, added to the rising cost of food and household items.  One estimate suggests that a typical consumer is now facing a £73 a month increase in bills, of which about £58 is from rising energy costs. ""The added cost pressures set to come into play in April threatens to obliterate even the most finely tuned budgets."" said Myron Jobson, senior personal finance analyst at Interactive Investor.  The Office for National Statistics said that low earners, renters, parents, people with disabilities, unemployed people and divorcees were least able to afford a bill shock. Even before the latest increases, charity Citizens Advice said that in March, it referred 24,752 people to food banks or to other charitable support, up by 44% compared to the same month last year. The government has said it was taking ""decisive action"" to help people with the cost of living, including a £200 reduction to energy bills in October - which needs to be paid back in instalments, and a £150 reduction in council tax bills for 80% of billpayers.  Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Sir Keir Starmer, the leader of the Labour party, branded the government's response as ""pathetic"". He accused the government of forcing people to choose between heating their homes or eating. He said that the Labour party would introduce a one-off windfall tax on the profits of oil and gas companies and use the money to help households struggling to cope with rising energy bills. But Chancellor Rishi Sunak told the BBC's Newscast: ""I'm confident in what we've done. I know it's tough for people. We're facing a very difficult situation with the price of things going up and I want to do what we can to ameliorate some of that, but I'm also honest with people that we can't ameliorate all of it, sadly."""
