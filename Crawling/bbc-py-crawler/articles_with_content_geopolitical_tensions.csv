geopolitical tensions,National debt forecast to treble over next 50 years,2024-09-15,2024-09-12,Charlotte Edwards and Faisal Islam,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cewlwkg82ggo,"UK national debt is on course to treble over the next half a century due to several pressures, according to the government’s official forecaster. Those pressures include an ageing population, climate change, and rising geopolitical tensions, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) said in a report. The OBR said without extra tax revenues or a return to post-war productivity levels, the public finances were not sustainable over the long term, and ""something has got to give"". Chief Secretary to the Treasury Darren Jones said: “The OBR has laid bare the shocking state that our public finances were left in by the previous government."" Jones added that the UK was facing the ""highest debt since the 1960s, highest taxes since the 1940s, and debt on track to be almost three times our GDP"". The Conservative Party has been contacted for comment. Debt is the total amount of money owed by the government that has built up over years. It rises when there is a deficit - when the government spends more than it receives in income - and falls in those years when there is a surplus - when it spends less than it receives. The higher the debt-to-GDP ratio, the less likely a country is to pay back its debt in full. UK national debt is currently at almost 100% of GDP. The OBR says its base scenario is a national debt of 274% of GDP in 2071, with risks from war, disease, cyber-conflict and trade tensions pushing that even higher. Over the next 50 years, the government's public spending is projected to rise from 45% to over 60% of GDP. However, income generated is predicted to remain at around 40% of GDP. By 2071, the OBR projects the equivalent of a more than £200bn per year increase in public spending on health, social care, pensions and related benefits. Its Fiscal Risks and Sustainability Report claims the previous and current UK government's aspirations to raise defence spending to 2.5% of GDP could add pressure to the public finances. In addition, the cost of transitioning to net zero, battling extreme weather linked to climate change, and a falling birth rate could also lead to more spending and less revenue, it said. The bill for state pensions and social care is set to rise substantially. Some of this would be mitigated by lower education and working-age benefit spending. The public finances are already under pressure due to ""a succession of extraordinary shocks"" over the past two decades, the report notes. This includes the global financial crisis, the pandemic and the energy crisis. Based on policy settings from March 2024, the analysis warns that public finances will be put on ""an unsustainable path"". A spokesperson for the Prime Minister said the government is seeking to ""restore economic stability"". ""Work has begun to support the economy and businesses, and that's what our focus will be on"", she said."
geopolitical tensions,Why Ethiopia is so alarmed by an Egypt-Somalia alliance,2024-09-15,2024-08-30,Ian Wafula,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg415vex37o,"A military alliance between Somalia and Egypt is ruffling feathers in the fragile Horn of Africa, upsetting Ethiopia in particular - and there are worries the fallout could become more than a war of words. The tensions ratcheted up this week with the arrival of two Egyptian C-130 military aeroplanes in Somalia’s capital, Mogadishu, signalling the beginning of the deal signed earlier in August during a state visit by the Somali president to Cairo. The plan is for up to 5,000 Egyptian soldiers to join a new-look African Union force at the end of the year, with another 5,000 reportedly to be deployed separately. Ethiopia, which has been a key ally of Somalia in its fight against al-Qaeda-linked militants and is at loggerheads with Egypt over a mega dam it built on the River Nile, said it could not “stand idle while other actors take measures to destabilise the region”. Somalia’s defence minister hit back, saying Ethiopia should stop “wailing” as everyone “will reap what they sowed” - a reference to their diplomatic relations that have been on a downward spiral for months. It all comes down to the ambitions of Ethiopia’s Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, who wants his landlocked country to have a port. Ethiopia lost its access to the sea when Eritrea seceded in the early 1990s. On New Year’s Day, Mr Abiy signed a controversial deal with the self-declared republic of Somaliland to lease a 20km (12-mile) section of its coastline for 50 years to set up a naval base. It could also potentially lead to Ethiopia officially recognising the breakaway republic - something Somaliland is pushing hard for. Somaliland broke away from Somalia more than 30 years ago, but Mogadishu regards it very much as part of its territory - and described the deal as an act of “aggression”. Somalia fears such a move might set a precedent and encourage other countries to recognise Somaliland's independence, geopolitical analyst Jonathan Fenton-Harvey told the BBC. He added that neighbouring Djibouti was also worried it could harm its own port-dependent economy, as Ethiopia has traditionally relied on Djibouti for imports. In fact in an attempt to deescalate tensions, Djibouti’s foreign minister has told the BBC his country is ready to offer Ethiopia “100%” access to one of its ports. “It will be in the port of Tadjoura - 100km [62 miles] from the Ethiopia border,” Mahmoud Ali Youssouf told BBC Focus on Africa TV. This is definitely a change of tune for as recently as last year, a senior presidential adviser said Djibouti was reluctant to offer its neighbour unfettered access to the Red Sea. Attempts so far to calm tensions - by Turkey - have failed, with Somalia insisting it will not budge until Ethiopia recognises its sovereignty over Somaliland. Somalia has not only brought its Nile enemy Egypt into the mix, but also announced that Ethiopian troops would not be part of the AU force from next January. This is when the AU’s third peace support operation begins - the first one was deployed in 2007 months after Ethiopian troops crossed over the border to help fight al-Shabab Islamist militants, who then controlled the Somali capital. There are at least 3,000 Ethiopian troops under the current AU mission, according to the Reuters news agency. Last week, the Somali prime minister also said Ethiopia would have to withdraw its other 5-7,000 soldiers stationed in several regions under separate bilateral agreements - unless it withdrew from the port deal with Somaliland. Ethiopia sees this as a slap in the face for, as its foreign minister put it, “the sacrifices Ethiopian soldiers have paid” for Somalia. The withdrawal of troops would also leave Ethiopia vulnerable to jihadist attacks, Christopher Hockey, a senior researcher at the Royal United Services Institute, told the BBC. The planned deployment of Egyptian troops along its eastern border would also make Ethiopia particularly apprehensive, he added. Egypt sees Ethiopia’s Nile dam - in the west of the country - as an existential threat – and has warned in the past that it will take “measures” should its security be threatened. Egypt accuses Ethiopia of threatening its supply of water with the construction of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (Gerd). This began in 2011 on the Blue Nile tributary in Ethiopia’s northern-western highlands, from where 85% of the Nile's water flow. Egypt said Ethiopia pushed forward with the project in complete “disregard” of the interests and rights of downstream countries and their water security. It also argued that a 2% reduction in water from the Nile could result in the loss of around 200,000 acres (81,000 hectares) of irrigated land. For Ethiopia the dam is seen as a way of revolutionising the country by producing electricity for 60% of the population and providing a constant flow of electricity for businesses. The latest diplomatic efforts to work out how the dam should operate - and determine how much water will flow downstream to Sudan and Egypt - fell apart last December. Egypt sees its military deal with Somalia as “historic” - in the words of Egyptian President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi - and a possible chance to settle scores over the mega dam. Indeed the Nile dispute may well play out in Somalia, warns Dr Hassan Khannenje, the director of the Horn International Institute for Strategic Studies. It could potentially lead to a “low-scale inter-state conflict” between Ethiopia and Egypt if their troops meet at the Somalia border. Somaliland has also warned that the establishment of Egyptian military bases within Somalia could destabilise the region. Both Ethiopia and Somalia are already coping with their own internal strife - Ethiopia with low-level rebellions in several regions and Somalia, recovering from a destructive 30-year civil war, still has al-Shabab to contend with. Experts say neither can afford further warfare - and more unrest would inevitably lead to further migration. Dr Khannenje told the BBC that if a conflict broke out, it could further complicate the geopolitics of the Red Sea by drawing in other players and further affect global trade. At least 17,000 ships go through the Suez Canal each year, meaning that 12% of annual global trade passes through the Red Sea, amounting to $1tn (£842bn) worth of goods, according to shipping monitor Lloyd’s List. For this reason, countries like Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Turkey have been keen to forge partnerships with African nations like Somalia that border the Red Sea. According to Mr Harvey, Turkey and the UAE stand a better chance at mediating and finding a middle ground. The UAE has heavily invested in Somaliland’s Berbera port and holds significant influence over Ethiopia because of its investments there. All eyes will be on the next diplomatic push by Turkey, which has ties with both Ethiopia and Somalia. Talks are due to start in mid-September.

geopolitical tensions,France on charm offensive as New Caledonia simmers,2024-09-15,2024-08-30,Katy Watson,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8rx1vr83ldo,"For the Pacific Islands, climate change, geopolitics and security have often been the bread and butter of any summit. But at this year’s Pacific Island Forum Leader’s Meeting - the region’s biggest diary event - there was another hot topic thrown into the mix: that of New Caledonia and the unrest that hit the French overseas territory back in May. A controversial French proposal to extend voting rights to people who had lived on the islands for more than 10 years sparked deadly protests. Eleven people have since died – nine civilians and two French gendarmes - and there are still French police on the ground. President Emmanuel Macron visited New Caledonia and, in June, halted the reform.  But tensions remain high, with a growing push towards independence among the Indigenous Kanaks, who make up 41% of the population. The French have said they want to set the record straight. They were on a PR mission in Tonga, where leaders from all 18 island nations and territories gathered this past week, including New Caledonia’s President Louis Mapou. But small island nations were sceptical - the violence in New Caledonia had seen support for the French wane. And many saw it as an attempt by France to hold on to a strategic part of the world where the US and China were fighting for sway. “We’ve seen lots of nice press about the French delegation throughout this week,” Véronique Roger-Lacan, France’s ambassador to the Pacific, said on Thursday, breaking into an ironic laugh. She was holding a press briefing that had been heavily publicised, her team consistently encouraging media to attend. She made it clear they were there to answer questions and show transparency in what had been a bruising few months not just for New Caledonia but for France’s reputation in the region. The French delegation attended as a ""dialogue partner"" - one of 21 such countries with interests in the region, inlcuding Washington and Beijing. As an overseas French territory, New Caledonia's defence, foreign affairs and policing are coordinated by France. To many here, it looked like France was chaperoning the pro-independence leader. “Being a country in the Pacific we can feel that we are part of a community of challenges,” François-Xavier Léger, the French Ambassador to Fiji, said at the briefing. And before that, Ambassador Roger-Lacan said that ""New Caledonia is France"". These comments ruffled feathers at the forum, where there was much discussion of decolonisation and independence. “In making this kind of statement, it’s not really helping the discussion,” said Reverend Billy Wetewea, a pastor at the Protestant Church of Kanaky who also attended the forum. Reverend Wetewea has worked with many of the Kanaky youth in New Caledonia who led the protests. “I don’t justify the violence, but I think it can be explained through social dynamics,” he said, adding that years of inequality in education, health and social issues had taken their toll. New Caledonia is on the United Nation’s list of non-self-governing territories - countries the UN monitors in their progress towards independence. France has been clear it is following the steps towards decolonisation. The Nouméa Accord, signed in 1998, put the territory onto a path of more autonomy. The intention was that over a 20-year period, a more independent New Caledonia would emerge. Three referendums were also tabled. In the first, held in 2018, voters rejected independence by 56.7%. Then in 2020, there was a narrower victory for the anti-independence side - 53%. In 2021, independence parties boycotted the final referendum, arguing that the vote was being rushed through. The Covid pandemic had made campaigning impossible and Indigenous Kanaks were still taking part in rituals to bury their dead. Unsurprisingly, the pro-France side won with an overwhelming majority. That last referendum has set the tone for the past few years of strain between France and the Kanaks, who feel that France playing isn't fair in their path to decolonisation. When asked by the BBC what France could do to change that view, Ambasssador Roger-Lacan was resolute they are doing everything by the book. “This is the ongoing job in New Caledonia with you all in the press,” she said. “Things have to be portrayed in a neutral manner, everywhere, disinformation has to be stopped, right information has to be put to the people on this self-determination and democratic process.” While France may blame the media for not reporting their side, many here blamed France’s tone – and questioned their interests. “They want to maintain their presence in the Pacific geopolitically [with] the fear of China taking over the Pacific,” Reverend Billy Wetewea said. China sent its largest-ever delegation to the forum this year. And the US delegation was led by Kurt Campbell, President Joe Biden’s Deputy Secretary of State, widely credited as the architect of Washington’s recent alliance-building in Asia. France’s position in the Pacific was brought into sharp focus in 2021, when Australia cancelled a multi-billion dollar contract with a French firm to build nuclear submarines. Instead it signed a new, key defence pact with the US and the UK. This, researcher Benoît Trépied said, altered France’s approach with New Caledonia: “Suddenly there was a huge new interest of French officials in the Pacific. [The] colonial, imperial reflex which was – no, if we want to be powerful in the Pacific, New Caledonia has to stay French. Period.” Despite the stand-off, this week’s meeting was fruitful. Leaders endorsed a planned fact-finding mission to visit New Caledonia, which was meant to happen earlier but disagreements over who was in control of the mission made the timing slip. But for Reverend Wetewea, there needs to be more dialogue. “They cannot take decisions without consulting the people,” he said. “If they make their own decisions, it will be really tense again. Now the youth want their voice to be heard.”"
geopolitical tensions,Russia accuses six British diplomats of spying,2024-09-15,2024-09-13,Hafsa Khalil,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpw8wp0w29vo,"Russia has revoked the accreditation of six British diplomats it has accused of spying. The country's security service, the FSB, said in a statement it had received documents indicating Britain's involvement in inflicting ""a strategic defeat"" on Russia.  The UK Foreign Office said the accusations against the diplomats were ""completely baseless"".  While the BBC understands the diplomats involved left Russia many weeks ago, the announcement coincides with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's visit to Washington, where he is expected to discuss whether to allow Ukraine to fire Western long-range missiles at targets inside Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin has suggested Moscow will regard this as a serious escalation in the war which equates to the ""direct participation"" of Nato countries. ""If that is the case, we will take corresponding decisions based on the threats that will be created to us,"" he said on state TV. The UK Foreign Office said that Russia revoked the diplomatic accreditations last month, following action the UK had taken against Russian state-directed activity in the UK and Europe.  ""We are unapologetic about protecting our national interests,"" a spokesperson said. Former national security advisor Lord Peter Ricketts said the allegations levelled at the six diplomats were ""trumped up"".  He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was a retaliatory punishment for the UK's continued military support of Ukraine ahead of the meeting in Washington. He added that it was Putin's way of trying to ""intimidate western politicians"".   Diplomatic accreditation is given by the host nation to recognise a person’s diplomatic status, as set out by the UN.  Without it, a person does not have official diplomatic status. Announcing the decision on Friday, the FSB said the diplomats had shown signs of conducting intelligence gathering and were tasked with inflicting a ""strategic defeat on our country"". In a Telegram post, Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Moscow ""fully share[s] the assessments"" made by the FSB on the activities of the diplomats. ""The British embassy has gone far beyond the limits outlined by the Vienna Conventions [UN treaty on diplomatic relations],"" she said. An FSB officer told Russian media ""hints"" to ""stop this practice [of gathering intelligence]"" were not heeded. The security service added that it would revoke accreditation from more British diplomats if they are found to be involved in similar activity. Noele Crossley, an associate professor in international security, told the BBC it was a ""worrying sign that bilateral relations are deteriorating further"". The University College London professor said ""the diplomatic crisis reflects wider geopolitical and strategic tensions"", adding that there may be ""hostile rhetoric"" still to come from Russia. Prof Mark Galeotti, an expert on modern Russia at the Rusi think tank, told the BBC the revocation was bad news for an embassy already ""pared to the bone"" in a country the UK needed to maintain diplomatic connections. He said that while former Soviet Union leaders would occasionally expel diplomats, they ""understood that it was important to have robust diplomatic connections"".  President Putin, he said, had gone further, which was ""alarming"". The diplomats involved were named and pictured on Russian state TV earlier on Friday. Expulsions of diplomats have become increasingly common since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Earlier this year, British diplomat Capt Adrian Coghill was given a week to leave Russia, days after the Russian defence attaché was expelled from London for alleged espionage as an ""undeclared military intelligence officer"". On Wednesday, UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy said the UK would provide £600m ($780m) in aid to Ukraine to support the country's ""humanitarian, energy and stabilisation needs"". Last week's summit in Germany also saw the UK commit to sending hundreds more short-range missiles to Ukraine, with the US pledging a further $250m (£189.9m) in military aid.

geopolitical tensions,Shop prices fall for first time in nearly three years,2024-09-15,2024-08-27,Nick Edser,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz07n5v99xmo,"Summer sales by fashion retailers trying to shift stock helped shop prices to record their first annual fall for nearly three years, research suggests. Prices in August were down 0.3% from a year ago, the lowest rate since October 2021, according to the British Retail Consortium (BRC). The drop in prices was driven by non-food goods, such as clothing and furniture, with retailers offering discounts after wet weather and continued cost-of-living pressures hit sales. Food prices continued to rise, but at a slower pace, the BRC industry body said. Fresh food inflation, such as fruit, meat and fish, had seen the biggest monthly decrease since December 2020, it said, thanks to falling costs from suppliers. But the BRC said non-food retailers had been ""discounting heavily to shift their summer stock, particularly for fashion and household goods"". ""This discounting followed a difficult summer of trading caused by poor weather and the continued cost of living crunch impacting many families."" The BRC said prices of non-food goods were 1.5% lower in August than they had been a year ago. Food prices were up 2%, but this was down from July's figure of 2.3%. BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said that while households will be ""happy"" to see the prices of some goods falling, there was no guarantee this trend would continue. ""The outlook for commodity prices remains uncertain due to the impact of climate change on harvests domestically and globally, as well as rising geopolitical tensions,"" she said. ""As a result, we could see renewed inflationary pressures over the next year.”  Lindsay James, investment strategist at Quilter Investors, said the wet summer weather had really hit clothing sales. She told the BBC's Today programme that while there were ""encouraging signs that inflation is coming under control"", the figures were also a ""reminder that this economic recovery is fragile"". The most recent official inflation figures - which indicate how fast prices are rising overall - showed the rate rose to 2.2% in July, the first increase this year. The rise in July had been widely predicted and was due to prices of gas and electricity falling by less than they did a year before. The Bank of England has predicted the inflation rate will rise to about 2.75% in the coming months before falling below 2% next year. Inflation soared in 2022 mainly due to a sharp jump in energy prices. Oil and gas were in greater demand after the Covid pandemic, and prices surged again when Russia invaded Ukraine. The recent slowdown in inflation meant the Bank of England felt able to cut interest rates to 5% from 5.25% earlier this month - the first cut since the start of the pandemic in March 2020. However, the Bank's governor, Andrew Bailey, said at the time that it needed ""to make sure inflation stays low and be careful not to cut interest rates too quickly or by too much"". Andrew Murphy, chief executive of toy retailer The Entertainer, which has 165 UK stores, told BBC that some of the cost pressures it has been facing over the past 18 months ""have started to ease just a little"". However, he added that the biggest cost not related to the products it buys was  wages, which have risen by about 10% this year due to increases in the national living wage and ""that one will continue to grow"".

geopolitical tensions,N Korea releases rare photos of Kim at uranium facility,2024-09-15,2024-09-13,Jean Mackenzie,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly9ypzq8qeo,"North Korea has for the first time offered a glimpse into a uranium enrichment facility which produces material for its nuclear weapons. Photographs showed its leader Kim Jong Un, who had earlier vowed to ""exponentially"" increase the country's stash of nuclear weapons, inspecting the area.  The state's Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said in a report on Friday that he had similarly called for the uranium facility to increase its production.   Enriched uranium is essential in the manufacturing of nuclear warheads.  The photograph shows Mr Kim walking past rows of centrifuges and talking to military officials. Their publication comes amid heightened tensions on the Korean peninsula. ""[Mr Kim] went round the control room of the uranium enrichment base to learn about the overall operation of the production lines,"" KCNA reported, adding that he ""felt strong"" to see the site. The South Korean government has said it strongly condemns the North's plans to increase production.  North Korea did not reveal when Mr Kim made the visit, nor which facility he visited – whether this is part of its sprawling Yongbyon nuclear complex, or another undisclosed site. Experts have long suspected that North Korea is covertly running at least one uranium enrichment facility, in addition to its well-known Yongbyon site. Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul said North Korea has disclosed the facility to ""boast of its nuclear development and signal that its weapons program is irreversible"". ""The Kim regime may also be flaunting that it still enjoys diplomatic and economic support from Russia and China, despite its nuclear buildup,"" Prof Easley told the BBC.  Hong Min, a senior analyst at the Korea Institute for National Unification, had told news agency AFP that the photographs could be a ""message"" to the upcoming US presidential election, meant to show the next administration that it would be ""impossible to denuclearise North Korea"". ""It is also a message demanding other countries to acknowledge North Korea as a nuclear state,"" Mr Hong said. South Korea's Ministry of Unification has condemned the North for publicising the facility, adding that the illegal deployment of nuclear weapons violates several resolutions set by the UN Security Council. ""Any nuclear threat or provocation by North Korea will be met with an overwhelming and strong response from our government and military, based on the solid extended deterrence of the South Korea-US alliance,"" the unification ministry said. It is not known how many nuclear weapons North Korea has, but one recent estimate puts the number at 50, with sufficient material to produce another 40. "
geopolitical tensions,Typical household energy bill up £149 a year in October,2024-09-15,2024-08-22,Kevin Peachey,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9qgy11w5dyo,"A typical household's annual energy bill will rise by £149 in October under the new price cap. People using an average amount of gas and electricity will pay £1,717 a year, a 10% rise compared with now. The cap, set by the energy regulator Ofgem, affects the price paid for each unit of gas and electricity used in 27 million homes in England, Wales and Scotland. Although prices are still lower than last winter, the rise in bills comes as some support for bills has been withdrawn, and the new government has announced it will halt winter fuel payments for 10 million pensioners in England and Wales. Energy prices have fallen twice this year - in April and July - but will head back up in the run-up to winter, by about £12 a month for a typical user. To calculate the effect on what households will pay this autumn, billpayers can add 10% to their current annual bill. The rise in the price cap is the result of higher prices on the international energy market, Ofgem said, owing to increasing geopolitical tensions and extreme weather driving competition and demand for gas, which determines the price of wholesale electricity. Bills will remain about £117 a year cheaper for a typical household than in October last year, but analysts say another rise in prices is likely in January. Standing charges are rising by one penny a day for gas and also for electricity, but the regulator is considering reforming the system. Energy consumer minister Miatta Fahnbulleh has invited the heads of the energy suppliers for a meeting on 28 August to discuss how to support the most vulnerable with their bills as a result. In specific terms:  Prices are much lower than their peak, but they remain well above pre-Covid pandemic levels, and financial support from the government has either been wound down or is being cut. The final cost-of-living payment was made to eight million people on means-tested benefits in February, and the new government has announced it will stop winter fuel payments for 10 million pensioners in England and Wales.  The payment is a devolved matter in Scotland and Northern Ireland and the Scottish government confirmed it will also no longer provide winter fuel payments to all pensioners. Billy and Sylvia Cunningham, a couple aged in their 70s from Warrington, are two people that will be hit by the benefit changes. ""We did get the help last year, but we still felt the cold, we still had to wrap in blankets and watch the smart meter shooting up,"" said Mrs Cunningham. Her husband has Parkinson’s and struggles when he gets cold. ""It’s hard work sometimes,"" he said. ""If your fingers are freezing, you can't do nothing."" The couple are just £100 above the threshold to qualify for pension credit, a state pension top-up, and so will also miss out on the winter fuel payment worth another £200. One unexpected bill, they said, could push them into an overdraft as higher prices had already eroded their savings buffer. Some households are already in debt to their supplier and now face increased prices in the run up to winter.  Latest Ofgem figures show that £3.3bn is owed to suppliers by customers behind on, or not paying, bills. That figure is expected to rise when the next data is published in September. Ofgem chief executive Jonathan Brearley said prices would be ""volatile"" in the long-term and so building a low-carbon, homegrown energy system was a sensible policy. Energy secretary Ed Miliband said the increase in prices would be ""deeply worrying"" for families. ""We will also do everything in our power to protect billpayers, including by reforming the regulator to make it a strong consumer champion, working to make standing charges fairer, and a proper warm homes plan to save families money,"" the Labour MP said. Conservative Claire Coutinho, shadow energy secretary, criticised the government's decision to make the winter fuel payment benefit means-tested. Although the price cap is changed every three months, it is illustrated by Ofgem in terms of an annual bill for a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity. People in larger properties will tend to pay more overall due to higher energy usage, while those in smaller properties likely use less so pay less.  As well as announcing the new price cap, Ofgem also outlined options to change the standing charge billing system. Standing charges are the fixed daily fees paid for being connected to the system, but they are unaffected by how much people use. The short-term options presented by the regulator include a potential plan to move between £20 and £100 from the standing charge to the price paid for every unit of energy used, giving customers the opportunity to save money by lowering their usage. But many vulnerable people do not have the opportunity to do so, as they might need to keep the heating on, or use electricity to run medical equipment. Mr Brearley said there was ""no silver bullet"" when it came to altering standing charges. Greg Jackson, the boss of supplier Octopus Energy said it was ""crazy"" that standing charges were so high and varied by region. An estimated 880,000 low-income pensioner households eligible for pension credit currently fail to claim it. The government says it is worth an average of £3,900 a year and claiming it can qualify people for other financial support such as winter fuel payments. You can check your eligibility for pension credit via the government's online calculator. Information is also available on how to make a claim. There is also a phone line available on weekdays - 0800 99 1234. Guide to benefits, when you qualify and what to do if something goes wrong, are provided by the independent MoneyHelper website, backed by government. Benefits calculators are also run by Policy in Practice, and charities Entitledto, and Turn2us."
geopolitical tensions,Rising grocery prices fail to dampen wine sales,2024-09-15,2024-08-13,Faarea Masud,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2n35483gmo,"Grocery price inflation has risen for the first time in more than a year - but this did not stop shoppers splashing out on booze to celebrate a summer of sport, new figures suggest. Wine sales were up 35% on the day of the Olympic opening ceremony - with 4.6 million bottles sold - alongside £10m worth of beer bought on the day of the Euro football final, according to market research firm Kantar. That came despite a 1.8% rise in grocery price inflation in the four weeks to August, 0.2% higher than the prior four weeks. The rate of supermarket price rises had previously fallen for 17 months in a row, Kantar said. It is getting slightly ""easier to go shopping at the supermarket than this time last year"", Fraser McKevitt, Kantar's head of retail and consumer insight told the BBC. ""We’ve moved well away from those days of double digit grocery price inflation,"" he said, but said consumers should shop around to get the best value for money. Kantar data suggested products which saw the fastest price rises included vitamin and mineral supplements, fruit juices and chocolate. Meanwhile toilet tissues, bottled cola and dog food saw the slowest price rises. It added that the return to better weather meant barbecue food sales were boosted in the weeks to August. Sales of cough lozenges rose by 28% as people battled Covid-19 and summer colds too, Kantar said. Supermarkets are locked in a fierce competition for customers, evidenced by lots of promotions and discounts being offered at the moment, Mr McKevitt added. Compared with last year, there was also an uptick of 3.8% in the amount people were taking home from supermarkets. The British Retail Consortium (BRC) warned that further inflation could be expected as climate change damages harvests after unusually wet weather in England. Extreme heat in other parts of the world has also destroyed crops which has reduced supply, pushing prices up. Combined with rising geopolitical tensions, further inflationary pressures could be ""lurking just over the horizon,"" said Helen Dickinson of the BRC. Overall inflation in the UK held at the Bank of England's target rate of 2% in June, although economists expect July's data to show a rise when it is released on Wednesday. This is partly because energy prices are not expected to have dropped as sharply this year compared to falls in 2023. The Bank of England key interest rate was this month lowered to 5% from 5.25%, marking the first cut since the start of the pandemic in March 2020. It had been raising the interest rate in a bid to cool inflation, which had been running at record levels in recent years. Kantar's latest data also showed among Britain's best-known supermarkets, Asda was rapidly losing its grip on market share. Its share of the groceries market was down 1.1% compared with last year, while rivals such as Sainsbury's recorded its largest year-on-year gain since July 1997.  Asda now has a 12.6% share of the UK grocery market, versus Tesco's 27.6%.  It reported a fall in sales of more than 5% in its latest financial results, prompting its chairman Lord Stuart Rose to suggest that co-owner Mohsin Issa should step back from running the firm.  He told the Telegraph newspaper he was ""embarrassed"" by the supermarket's recent performance. Increasing competition from the discount supermarkets is reportedly eating into Asda's successes, but chief financial officer Michael Gleeson said: ""It is important to highlight that switching losses to the discounters, Aldi and Lidl as well, have receded""."
geopolitical tensions,Why the world's anti-doping agency feels stuck between US and China,2024-09-15,2024-08-01,Kelly Ng,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cv2gygj1d28o,"The World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) says it is ""unfairly caught"" in a row between the US and China, with their geopolitical tensions spilling onto the Olympic stage.  China's top swimmers have been in the spotlight after a slew of doping allegations, followed by contentious US claims that Wada was covering it up.  Chinese swimmers headed to Paris were drug-tested twice as much as some other nations, which, in turn, has fuelled accusations of a conspiracy to disrupt their performance.  Wada said in its statement on Tuesday that it had been caught in ""the middle of geopolitical tensions between superpowers but has no mandate to participate in that"".  ""Certain individuals [in the US] are attempting to score political points purely on the basis that the athletes in question are Chinese,"" Wada head of media relations James Fitzgerald told the BBC. ""The result is that it has created distrust and division within the anti-doping system."" A trade war, geopolitical rivalries and Beijing's friendship with Russia have soured relations between the world's two largest economies.  It's little surprise that some of those tensions play out in competitive sports but now they appear to be driving a harder - and harsher - wedge. Last week, Wada had said it was considering legal action against its US counterpart, Usada, over ""defamatory"" accusations.  The latter had accused Wada and China's anti-doping agency, Chinada, of being among the ""dirty hands in burying positive tests and suppressing the voices of courageous whistleblowers"".  US lawmakers, too, have accused Wada of failing to investigate doping allegations against Chinese swimmers properly. And on Tuesday they introduced a bill that would give the White House power to cut funding to the agency.  ""When members of congress and senators are inserting themselves into the largely technical world of anti-doping, it ceases to be about scientific and legal analysis, and it drifts into the political realm,"" said Mr Fitzgerald. Wada's statement on Tuesday followed reports in the New York Times about a previously undisclosed case involving two Chinese swimmers - including one on this year’s Olympic team - who were investigated for doping.  They had tested positive for a banned steroid in 2022, but they were cleared to compete. China's anti-doping agency concluded that the athletes had most likely consumed the steroid unknowingly while eating contaminated burgers. Usada accused Wada of letting China ""compete under a different set of rules, tilting the field in their favour"".  But Wada defended the decision. It said the athletes’ nutritional supplements and hair tests had returned negative results, and that both swimmers also provided control samples that were negative in the days before and after the one test that was positive. It added that the two swimmers were suspended for more than a year and then their cases were closed.  Their cases are part of a ""wider series of cases involving [Chinese] athletes from different sports"",  the agency said, adding that, ""based on the number of cases, clearly there is an issue of contamination in several countries around the world"". In a statement in June, Wada noted that athletes who eat meat sometimes test positive for drugs if they have ingested clenbuterol, a banned substance which is used as a growth promoter for farm animals.  That statement, in response to questions from the New York Times, said the agency  was investigating instances of contamination in China as well as Mexico, Guatemala and other countries.  The agency's boss Olivier Niggli pointed out at the time that US media had ""only asked questions about China when meat contamination is an issue in many countries"", and referred to ""attempts to politicise anti-doping"". All of this follows a bigger controversy in April, when the New York Times reported that 23 Chinese swimmers had tested positive for a performance-enhancing drug months before the 2021 Tokyo Olympics.  But they were cleared to compete after Chinese officials found the results were caused by contamination. The 30-member team went on to win six medals, inlcuding three golds in Tokyo. Eleven of those who tested positive were also picked to be part of the Chinese swimming team for the Paris Olympics. US swimmer and 11-time Olympic medalist Katie Ledecky had said her confidence in anti-doping regulators was at an ""all-time low"" after the news about the 23 Chinese swimmers. Wada's investigation, however, found that it was ""not in a position to disprove the possibility that contamination"" was the source of the drug, heart medication trimetazidine (TMZ).  It said the contamination theory was supported by ""the combination of the consistently low concentrations of TMZ as well as no doping pattern"" among the tested athletes. That is, their test results over several days were not consistent, veering between negative and positive.   An independent investigation found that Wada did not mishandle the case or show bias towards the Chinese swimmers.   The scandals upped the pressure on anti-doping officals and by the time the Chinese swimming team arrived in Paris, they were being tested far more than is standard.   Since January,  each of the team's 31 members have been tested, on average, 21 times by various anti-doping organisations, according to World Aquatics, which oversees water sports. In comparison, Australia's 41 swimmers have been tested an average of four times and the 46 US swimmers, an average of six times. The flurry of tests has sparked another set of allegations. The state-run Chinese newspaper the Global Times blames Western powers for ""abusing doping tests to disrupt [the] Chinese swimming team"".  Speaking to the Global Times, an international politics professor in Shanghai, accused the US of dominating anti-doping rules. Shen Yi suggested that the ""relentless and unethical testing"" had disrupted the Chinese team's training, which she called a ""disgrace to the Olympics"".  Chinese swimmer Qin Haiyang, who holds the world record for the 200m men's breastroke, said this testing ""proves that European and American teams feel threatened by the performances of the Chinese team in recent years"".  ""Some tricks aim to disrupt our preparation rhythm and destroy our psychological defence. But we are not afraid,"" he said on Chinese social media platform Weibo. Qin, who won golds in the 50m, 100m and 200m breaststroke at the world championships last year, finished in seventh place in the men's 100m breaststroke final on Sunday.  This criticism was echoed by former Chinese diving champion Gao Min who said the rigorous testing had ""disrupted our Chinese swimming team"" and called Qin's performance ""the worst in any competition over the past two years”.   China's current medal tally stands at one gold, two silver and two bronze.  China's “butterfly queen”, Zhang Yufei, who won a silver in the 100m event in Tokyo, was in tears over her bronze finish on Monday but said the doping tests did not have a big impact on her. While they were a ""bit annoying"", she said it was the pressure that was ""far greater"" than she had imagined. Additional reporting by Annabelle Liang "
geopolitical tensions,Americans freed in Russia prisoner swap reunite with families,2024-09-15,2024-08-02,Will Grant & Cai Pigliucci,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cv2g2dx7d9wo,"Three Americans who were freed in a prisoner swap deal with Russia, including Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, have arrived back on US soil. Mr Gershkovich, 32, was one of 16 people swapped for eight Russian prisoners in what has been described as the biggest exchange since the end of the Cold War between Russia and the West. The exchange at an airfield in Turkey also included the release of former US marine Paul Whelan and Russian-American journalist Alsu Kurmasheva. After touching down at Joint Base Andrews, in Maryland, Mr Gershkovich, Ms Kurmasheva and Mr Whelan emerged from the jet to cheers from those on the tarmac. All three were greeted by US President Joe Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris before they embraced their families. They lingered on the tarmac for photographs and conversations before leaving the air base within an hour, as did Mr Biden and Ms Harris's motorcades. Speaking ahead of their return, Mr Biden welcomed their release and declared: ""Their brutal ordeal is over."" He praised the role played by America's allies, particularly Germany and Slovenia, and hailed the release of Mr Whelan, Mr Gershkovich and Ms Kurmasheva, as well as leading Kremlin critic Vladimir Kara-Murza, as a ""feat of diplomacy"". The three released Americans were then sent to the Brooke Army Medical Centre in Texas for a medical check-up.  The deal had been more than 18 months in the making and appears to have hinged on Moscow's demand for the return of Vadim Krasikov, who was serving a life sentence in Germany for carrying out an assassination in a Berlin park. He is now back in Russia. Krasikov always maintained in captivity that the false identity he went under was real, but the Kremlin has admitted since his release that he was an agent with the FSB security service. In total, 24 people jailed in seven different countries were exchanged in Ankara, Turkey's presidency said. The prisoners were held in the US, Germany, Poland, Slovenia, Norway, Russia and Belarus, it said in a statement. Ten people, including two minors, were relocated to Russia, 13 prisoners to Germany, and three to the US, the statement added. The eight prisoners who returned to Russia were serving sentences on a variety of criminal charges in the West. Charges against the 16 held in Russia and Belarus included espionage and treason, but were generally considered by Western governments and rights organisations to be politically motivated. Of the 13 staying in Germany, most either have German citizenship or are former Russian political prisoners.  The fate of the latter group seems unclear, as they have in effect been expelled from Russia. At least one of them, Ilya Yashin, has said in the past he did not want to be involved in a swap. Another, Andrei Pivovarov, was due to be released within Russia in September after completing his sentence, his mother told the Insider website in an interview. Oleg Orlov, 71, is a veteran Russian human rights campaigner and a founder of the long-standing and recently banned Memorial organisation. The 13 also seem to include Mr Kara-Murza, who has dual UK-Russian citizenship and is resident in the US. It is thought he may return to the US separately. In Russia, President Vladimir Putin personally greeted the Russians released from Western jails with bouquets of flowers at Moscow's Vnukovo Airport. He embraced them warmly on a red carpet and said they would be given state awards. Among those returned to Moscow in addition to Krasikov was a Russian couple, convicted of spying in Slovenia, who returned to Russia with their two children. German citizen Rico Krieger, who was sentenced to death in Belarus before being  pardoned by the country's leader Alexander Lukashenko earlier this week, has also been released. Earlier prisoner swap discussions had included jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, but the offer collapsed when he died in unclear circumstances in an Arctic penal colony in February. His widow Yulia Navalnaya welcomed the swap, describing it as a ""joy"". Three of the released dissidents were former regional leaders of Navalny's anti-corruption network, now branded extremist in Russia. Mr Yashin was also a close associate. The exchange comes after days of speculation about a major swap between various countries, which increased after several dissidents and journalists jailed in Russia were moved from their prison cells to unknown locations. Although secret prison transfers are common in Russia, the multiple disappearances of well-known prisoners was unusual. The last high-profile prisoner swap took place in December 2022, when US  basketball star Brittney Griner was exchanged on the tarmac at Abu Dhabi airport  for notorious Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout, who had been held in an American prison for 12 years. The last comparable one occurred in Vienna in 2010, when 10 Russian spies held in the US were swapped for four alleged double agents held in Russia. One of them was Sergei Skripal, a former military intelligence officer, later poisoned by nerve agent Novichok in Salisbury in 2018. Tensions between Moscow and the West have been high in recent years, especially since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. And Chatham House expert James Nixey told the BBC that while this was a rare good day in relations and a victory for diplomacy, it should not be seen as Russia showing its ""softer side"". It merely showed that Russia was determined to get its own people back, whatever crimes they had committed, he said. ""From the Kremlin point of view, it merely confirms that hostage-taking and extortion is a successful tool in its wider geopolitical struggle,"" he added."
geopolitical tensions,Iron Age hill fort was six times bigger than thought,2024-09-15,2024-07-18,Andy Giddings,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm528je0yr7o,"An Iron Age hillfort in south Shropshire was six times larger than originally thought, archaeologists have discovered. The group, from the Time Team television programme and universities of Chester and York, carried out research using sensors mounted on aircraft to map the area around Bodbury Ring. They said it appeared that the previously identified earthworks were only a small part of a much larger settlement. The remains of what could be a Roman Iron Age settlement have also been uncovered. The research was led by University of Chester Visiting Professor, Stewart Ainsworth. He said the known earthworks were probably the ""more easily defended fort at the southern tip of the original hillfort, possibly in the Middle Iron Age"". He believes the larger settlement, near Church Stretton, may have been downsized at some point, possibly as a result of ""increased tension in the region, reflecting possible changes in the geopolitical landscape of the times"".  The survey work was carried out without any digging being necessary. The sensors mounted on the aircraft created ""high-resolution laser scan data"", the team said, which was later studied to provide the insights. Follow BBC Shropshire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

geopolitical tensions,Exploring the role of ordinary Scots during the Cold War,2024-09-15,2024-07-12,Oliver Coe,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4ngeg4r3yno,"""From 1961, when the US submarines arrived, Scotland became a legitimate target for nuclear attack,"" says Dr Meredith Greiling, the woman in charge of a new exhibition on the Cold War. The decision to allow the Americans to base their Polaris submarines - and the nuclear missile system they carried - at Holy Loch near Dunoon put Scotland on the frontline of a stand-off between the world's great superpowers - the US and the Soviet Union. The new exhibition at the National Museum of Scotland is looking at the role ordinary Scots played in the Cold War - the name given to the decades of deadlock that saw the US and the USSR constantly on the edge of nuclear Armageddon. It explores the legacies which linger in Scottish politics, culture and memory. In the wake of World War Two, the nuclear age presented the opportunity for jobs and cheap power generation but it also carried the looming threat of nuclear annihilation. The standoff between the US and Soviet Russia resulted in the largest arms race in history, with both sides increasing their nuclear arsenals at an alarming rate.  During these years of geopolitical tension, Scotland played a key role. ""Scotland's geography made it strategically really important, especially when the US Navy brought the Polaris submarines, the 1960s Nato nuclear deterrent,"" Dr Greiling said. Scotland was perfectly placed to detect Russian communications and submarines in the seas between the US and the USSR. Military bases, some under US control, were set up across Scotland, including RAF Edzell.  This base was home to the US Army and part of its High Frequency Direction Finding (HFDF) Network, which was used to track targets worldwide.  One of the most controversial installations was the US Navy's ballistic missile submarine base at Holy Loch. This base housed US nuclear submarines during the Cold War, allowing the US to patrol waters 1,500 miles from the USSR. Kim Foden, from Kirkwall in Orkney, was one of the people who helped the museum with the exhibition - named Cold War Scotland. She said: ""I was brought up in a household where I was very aware of nuclear energy and power - and the destruction that could be caused by nuclear bombs."" When she left school in 1968, she worked for the Royal Observer Corps and was trained to carry out a very specific task in the event of nuclear weapons being launched. If the alarm was raised, her job was to take specialist equipment to an underground outpost and establish communication with other sites around the country. She was trained to take readings, such as radiation levels, and send them to scientists and other military personnel if nuclear bombs were ever dropped. ""Getting information could be the key to saving lives,"" she said. Another major part of the exhibition is the stories of those who protested against the nuclear installations in Scotland. Kristin Barrett was a dedicated advocate for nuclear disarmament for more than 60 years. She started campaigning at the age of 17 while studying at the University of Aberdeen in 1960, joining protest marches on RAF Edzell and Aldermaston, the site of the UK government's atomic weapons programme. The exhibition features photos of Ms Barrett including ones with her daughter's pram that she converted into a stall to distribute Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) leaflets and badges in her hometown of Blairgowrie. In 1982, she took part in the Peace March Scotland from Inverness to Edinburgh.  During the march, she was given a protest rattle made from an old laundry detergent bottle, emblazoned with the CND logo, by a Church of Scotland minister. It is one of the items on display in the exhibition. The Cold War ended with the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s but in the previous four decades the prospect of nuclear war was a very real threat. The exhibition also features items such as the steel blast doors of an Anti-Aircraft Operations Room (AAOR) in East Kilbride. These underground bunkers formed a network established in the 1950s to protect high-value targets from potential aerial attack.  Other striking remnants on display include the control panel from the Hunterston Nuclear Power Station, built on the North Ayrshire coast and opened in 1964. It was the largest nuclear power station of its kind in the world at the time and the first in Scotland dedicated to civilian use. An earlier plant at Chapelcross, opened in 1959, was primarily used for generating weapons-grade plutonium for nuclear weapons. Cold War Scotland will run until 26 January in the National Museum of Scotland at Edinburgh. Admission will be free and include a programme of events such as tours and talks by curators and museum experts."
geopolitical tensions,What are the big security threats coming down the track?,2024-09-15,2024-07-14,Frank Gardner,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cv2g4pjj2gwo,"On the face of it, this past week’s Nato summit in Washington has ticked the boxes. The alliance can show it is bigger and stronger than ever, its military support for Ukraine appears undiminished and it has just sent a robust message to China to stop secretly supporting Russia’s war on Kyiv. Sir Keir Starmer’s new government has had a chance to position itself as a linchpin in the transatlantic alliance at a time when political uncertainty hovers over the White House and much of Europe. Back home in Britain, the priorities for this new government are pressing: the economy, housing, immigration, the NHS, to name but a few.  Yet unwanted threats and scenarios can often have a habit of turning up and upsetting the best laid plans. So what could be coming down the track during the life of this new UK government?  No surprises here, this one is on everybody’s radar. But that does not make it any less dangerous, for Lebanon, Israel and the entire Middle East. ""The possibility of a large-scale Israeli invasion of Lebanon this summer should be at the top of the new government’s geopolitical risk register.""  That’s according to Professor Malcolm Chalmers, the Deputy Director-General of the Whitehall think tank, the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI).  With the conflict continuing in Gaza and the Houthi attacks on Red Sea shipping continuing, Prof Chalmers believes ""we could be entering a period of sustained multi-front warfare in the region, for which neither Israel nor its Western partners will be prepared."" Ever since the Hamas-led raid into southern Israel on 7 October last year, there have been fears that Israel’s subsequent military campaign in Gaza could escalate across borders into a full-scale regional war. Israel’s troubled northern border with Lebanon is where such a war is most at risk of igniting.  The daily exchange of fire across this border, between the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) and Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed Shia militia, have already resulted in hundreds killed, mostly in Lebanon.  More than 60,000 Israelis have been forced to abandon their homes and livelihoods in the north and an even greater number of people on the Lebanese side.  Domestic pressure is mounting for the Israeli government to ""deal with"" Hezbollah by pushing its forces north of Lebanon’s Litani River, from where they would have less chance of sending rockets into Israel. ""We don’t want to go to war,"" says Lt Col Nadav Shoshani of the IDF, ""but I don’t think any country could accept 60,000 of its citizens displaced. The situation has to end. We would like it to be a diplomatic solution, but Israeli patience is wearing thin.""  There are strong reasons for both sides not to go to war. Lebanon’s economy is already fragile. It has barely recovered from the 2006 war with Israel and a renewed full-scale conflict would have a devastating impact on the country’s infrastructure and its people. Hezbollah, for its part, would likely respond to a major Israeli attack and invasion with a massive and sustained missile, drone and rocket barrage that could potentially overwhelm Israel’s Iron Dome air defences.  Nowhere in Israel is beyond its reach. At this point, the US Navy, positioned offshore, could well join in on Israel’s side. Which then begs the question of what Iran would do.  It too has a sizeable arsenal of ballistic missiles as well as a network of proxy militias in Iraq, Yemen and Syria that could be mobilised to intensify their attacks on Israel. One way to take the heat out of the tension on the Israel-Lebanon border would be for the conflict in Gaza to come to an end. But after nine months and a horrific death toll, a lasting peace has yet to be achieved. The Iran nuclear deal, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), designed to contain and monitor Iran’s nuclear programme, was the crowning foreign policy achievement of the Obama administration in 2015.  But it has long since fallen apart.  One year after President Trump unilaterally withdrew from it, Iran stopped abiding by its rules.  Buried deep beneath gigantic mountains, ostensibly beyond the reach of even the most powerful of bunker-busting bombs, Iran’s nuclear centrifuges have been spinning frantically, enriching uranium to well beyond the 20% needed for peaceful civil purposes. (A nuclear bomb requires highly enriched uranium.) Officially, Iran insists its nuclear programme remains entirely peaceful, that it is purely for generating energy.  But Israeli and Western experts have voiced fears that Iran has a clandestine programme to reach what is known as ""breakout capability"": achieving a position where it has the capacity to build a nuclear bomb, but does not necessarily do so. It will not have escaped Iran’s notice that North Korea, an isolated, global pariah, has been steadily amassing an arsenal of nuclear warheads and the means to deliver them, constituting a major deterrent to any would-be attacker. If Iran gets the Bomb, then it is almost inevitable that Saudi Arabia, its regional rival, would also go after acquiring it. So would Turkey and so would Egypt.  And suddenly there is a nuclear arms race all across the Middle East. This depends on what you define as ""winning"".  At its maximalist, it means Russian forces overwhelming Ukraine’s defences and seizing the rest of the country including the capital Kyiv, replacing the pro-West government of President Volodymyr Zelensky with a puppet regime appointed by Moscow.  That, of course, was the original plan behind the full-scale Russian invasion of February 2022, a plan which failed spectacularly. This scenario is currently thought unlikely.  But Russia does not need to conquer the whole of Ukraine to be able to declare some kind of ""victory"", something that it can present to its population to justify the astronomically high casualties it is sustaining in this war. Russia already occupies around 18% of Ukraine and, in the east, its forces are slowly gaining ground.  Although more Western weapons are on their way, Ukraine is critically short of manpower. Its troops, fighting bravely, often heavily outnumbered and outgunned, are exhausted.  Russian commanders, who seem to care little for the lives of their men, have mass on their side. Russia’s entire economy has been placed on a war footing, with close to 40% of the state budget now devoted to defence. President Vladimir Putin, whose recent ""conditions for peace talks"" equated to total capitulation by Ukraine, believes he has time on his side. He knows there is a high chance that his old friend Donald Trump will be back in the White House within months and that Western support for Ukraine will start to crumble. Russia needs only to hang on to the territory it has already seized, and to deny Ukraine the chance of joining Nato and the EU, to declare a partial victory in the war it has portrayed as a fight for Russian survival. Again, there are plenty of warnings that this one might be coming.  China’s President Xi Jinping and his officials have stated on numerous occasions that the self-governing island democracy of Taiwan must be ""returned to the Motherland"", by force if necessary. Taiwan does not want to be ruled by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in Beijing. But China considers Taiwan a renegade province and it wants to see it ""reunited"" well before the centenary of the founding of the CCP in 2049. The US has adopted a position of what it calls ""strategic ambiguity"" over Taiwan.  It is legally bound to help defend Taiwan, but Washington prefers to keep China guessing as to whether that means sending US forces to fight off a Chinese invasion. China would almost certainly prefer not to invade Taiwan.  It would be hugely costly, in both blood and treasure. Ideally, Beijing would like Taiwan to give up on its dreams of full independence and volunteer to be ruled by the mainland.  But as that currently looks unlikely – the Taiwanese have watched with horror the crushing of democracy in Hong Kong – Beijing has another option up its sleeve.  If and when it decides to move on Taiwan, it is likely to try to seal it off from the outside world, making life unbearable for its citizens, but with the minimum of bloodshed so as to avoid provoking a war with the US. Does Taiwan matter? It does.  This is about more than lofty principles of defending a democratic ally on the other side of the world.  Taiwan produces more than 90% of the world’s top-end microchips, the miniscule bits of tech that power almost everything that runs our modern-day lives. A US-China war over Taiwan would have catastrophic consequences for the global economy that would dwarf the war in Ukraine. Not exactly, but there are some moderating factors here. For China, trade is all-important. Beijing’s ambitious plans to squeeze the US Navy out of the western Pacific and dominate the entire region may well be tempered by its reluctance to trigger damaging sanctions and a global trade war. In Ukraine, President Putin may be making slow, incremental territorial gains but this comes at a horrendous cost in casualties.  When the Red Army occupied Afghanistan in the 1980s, it suffered around 15,000 killed over a decade, triggering protests at home and hastening the demise of the Soviet Union.  In Ukraine, in just one quarter of that time, Russia has suffered many multiples of that death toll. To date, protest has been limited - the Kremlin largely controls what news Russians see - but the longer this war goes on, the greater the risk that the Russian public will eventually baulk at the mounting number of their fellow citizens getting killed. In Europe, where worries abound over a future Trump presidency withdrawing its historic protection, a new UK-led security pact is being prepared.  As the US presidential election in November draws closer, plans are accelerating to try to  mitigate any possible downsides to the continent’s security."
geopolitical tensions,'Protectionism eroding global business' - world trade chief,2024-09-15,2024-07-07,Jonathan Josephs,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce93n7lgw5qo,"Global trade “is not having the best of times at the moment”. That is the admission of the director general of the World Trade Organization (WTO), Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala. “We are seeing increasing protectionism, some undermining of the WTO rules, and some of this is leading to fragmentation,” she tells the BBC. “Global trade is really part of the lifeblood for making countries resilient - and also for underpinning growth, so we are concerned about that.” In recent weeks and months these fragmentations have come to the fore with the EU imposing provisional tariffs of up to 37.4% on imports of Chinese electric vehicles (EVs). It followed after the US in May introduced 100% tariffs on Chinese EVs. Both Brussels and Washington accuse the Chinese government of unfairly subsidising its EV sector, allowing producers to export cars at unfairly low prices, and threatening jobs in the West. President Biden has also increased import taxes on a range of other Chinese products that he said formed ""the industries of the future"". These include EV batteries and the minerals they contain, the cells needed to make solar panels, and computer chips. Meanwhile, the US has been pouring billions of dollars of government money into green technology, through its Inflation Reduction Act, which aims to reduce a reliance on Chinese imports. EU trade commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis tells the BBC that Europe does not want to close the market for EVs. “We welcome imports, we welcome competition, but this competition must be fair,” he says. Last year, the volume of global trade fell for just the third time in 30 years, according to the WTO. It says the 1.2% decline was linked to higher inflation and interest rates, and is forecasting a recovery this year. However those factors have their roots in events that are continuing to fundamentally reshape the global economy,  the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF’s) first deputy managing director Gita Gopinath explained in a recent speech. “What we've seen in the last few years, I would say, especially when it comes to global trade relations, is nothing like we've seen since the end of the Cold War.""  “The last few years, you've had numerous shocks, including the pandemic. We had Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and following these events, increasingly, countries around the world are guided by economic security, and national security concerns, in determining who they trade with and who they invest in,” she said. That’s affecting countries as far apart as Peru, Ghana and Vietnam as they increasingly find themselves having to choose between strengthening economic ties with the western powers, or a China-Russia axis. “We're also concerned about the emerging fragmentation that we see in the trade data,” says the WTO’s Dr Okonjo-Iweala. “We're seeing that trade between like-minded blocks is growing faster than trade across such blocks.” She warns that “it will be costly for the world” to continue down this path. WTO research has estimated that price at 5% of the global economy, whilst the IMF has suggested it could be nearer to 7% or $7.4tn (£5.8tn) of lost output in the long run. The EU’s introduction of tariffs on Chinese-made EVs follows a surge in their exports to Europe over the last few years. Exports jumped from $1.6bn in value in 2020 to $11.5bn last year, according to one study, which said they now made up 37% of all EV imports into the EU. BYD, Geely and SAIC are some of the Chinese EV makers said to have benefitted from billions of dollars worth of government help. After many years of support Chinese EV companies no longer need that help, says Jens Eskelund, president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China. “They are today simply very competitive on their own terms. I think the introduction of tariffs is a symptom that something is out of balance.” When it comes to broader relationship, Mr Eskelund says it’s “mind boggling” that since 2017 the volume of goods that the EU has sold to China has fallen about a third, even though China’s economy has been growing steadily. Citing Chinese restrictions around market access for overseas firms, and tough security regulations, he adds: “I think it's fair to say that that Europe still remains a significantly more open market to Chinese companies, then the other way around. And that is obviously something that needs to change.” The chamber’s recent survey showed that members have the lowest confidence on record for investing in China. It comes as the EU is trying to lower its economic dependence on China. European Commission President  Ursula von der Leyen last year described the need to “de-risk not de-couple” its relations with China. Brussels' concerns include Beijing using sensitive technology for military purposes, and its support for Russia as it continues its offensive in Ukraine. Companies including Ikea, Nike and Apple are also trying to become less reliant on China. Whilst the EU and China are set to hold talks about the potential EV tariffs, Chinese state media has reported that retaliatory measures are being considered on EU goods including pork, cognac and luxury cars. However, there are other barriers for global trade to overcome, including in two of the most important arteries for moving goods around the world. This year Panama Canal officials had to reduce the number of ships allowed to traverse the waterway. This is due to a lack of rainfall to fill the lake that feeds the canal. Meanwhile, the Suez Canal is effectively cut off because of ongoing attacks on commercial ships by Houthi rebels in the Red Sea. Traffic through the canal is down 90%, according to logistics firm Kuehne+Nagel. Rolf Habben Jansen, chief executive of the German shipping giant Hapag-Lloyd, says this disruption means that the rates his firm charges are up between 30% and 40%. Whilst shipping costs are a small part of retail prices, Mr Habben Jansen says “these extra costs in the end get passed on” to consumers. That could end up pushing inflation up just as central banks are showing signs of getting it under control. That would be “detrimental to consumers,” says the WTO’s Dr Okonjo-Iweala. Despite all the tensions, she says trade has shown signs of resilience, and she adds that her organization can help countries solve their differences. Meanwhile, Dr Okonjo-Iweala admits that some WTO rules will need to change to help meet the challenge of climate change.  “I strongly believe that some of our [global trade] rules, we do need to look at them,"" she says. “When they were put in place, decades ago, we were not confronting the kind of climate change threats we confront today.” Regarding the increased use of tariffs, she adds: “We hope we don't have a repeat of what we saw in the 1930s. We had retaliatory tariffs, and it was downhill from there and everyone lost. “So I do hope we will not enter into that kind of era again”. "
geopolitical tensions,"A year after mutiny, Kremlin controls Wagner remnants",2024-09-15,2024-06-23,Matt Murphy,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4nn1p81q59o,"Russia has effectively dismantled and replaced the Wagner Group in the year since the mercenaries shocked the world by launching a mutiny against President Vladimir Putin’s government, experts have told the BBC.  Yevgeny Prigozhin – the late leader of the paramilitary force – crossed from Ukraine on 23 June 2023 and seized the southern city of Rostov after months of increasing tensions with military leaders in Moscow. His forces then began a brief charge towards the capital, meeting virtually no resistance. The “march for justice”, as Prigozhin called it, came to an abrupt end the following day after he called off the advance. Just two months later, Prigozhin's plane crashed and he was killed along with several other senior Wagner members, throwing the group’s future into uncertainty. Dr Sorcha MacLeod, a member of the UN's working group on mercenaries and lecturer at the University of Copenhagen, said ex-Wagner troops had fragmented across the Russian state.  ""[Wagner] may not exist in exactly the form it did previously, but a version - or even versions - of it continue to exist,"" she told the BBC. ""There's been this sort of dispersal amongst the Russian state so there is no one overall controller."" ""The Wagner Group was incredibly important geopolitically and economically to Russia, so it was never going to disappear as some people suggested,"" she added.  For years, Prigozhin’s forces had been a valuable and deniable tool for Russian operations across Africa and Syria. But it was in Ukraine – as Moscow’s conventional forces struggled to dent Kyiv’s defences – that Prigozhin and Wagner came into the open. Throughout late 2022 and early 2023, Wagner was key to Russia’s few battlefield victories. Its forces – largely made up of ex-prisoners – managed to take the eastern city of Soledar, before it became entrenched in months of intense fighting in the meat-grinder of Bakhmut. At its peak Wagner had around 50,000 mercenaries in Ukraine, according to the US National Security Council. Now, experts say Wagner’s operations in Ukraine have been subsumed by other Russian state and paramilitary units. One ex-Wagner commander recently told BBC Russian that the mercenaries had been ordered to “join the ministry of defence” or to go away. UK intelligence officials have suggested that some of the group's infantry units have been subsumed by the Rosgvardia, or National Guard. The unit, established in 2016, has been described as Mr Putin’s “private army” and is controlled by his former bodyguard Viktor Zolotov. The UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) has said elements of the Wagner Group started coming under the National Guard’s control in October 2023. Referred to as “volunteer formations”, the ex-Wagner troops were to be deployed to Ukraine on six-month contracts and to Africa on nine-month contracts, it said. Anton Yelizarov – a long term Wagner operator who is said to have commanded the mercenaries' bloody operations in Bakhmut – appeared to confirm the integration days later. In a video posted to a Wagner-linked Telegram channel, he said he was present at the construction of a camp where Wagner troops would “work for the good of Russia” and join with National Guard units in a new formation. UK officials said the “incorporation of former Wagner assault detachments into Rosgvardia’s Volunteer Corps highly likely indicated that Wagner has been successfully subordinated into Rosgvardia, increasing the Russian state control over the Wagner Group”. Other ex-Wagner forces have signed up to fight with Vladimir Putin’s strongman in Chechnya – Ramzan Kadyrov – and his Akhmat forces, a recent BBC Russian investigation found. A tangible example of the group’s decline came when its logo was reportedly stripped from the tower block it had occupied in Russia’s second city of St Petersburg. In the days after the mutiny, Prigozhin was said to have cut a deal with Mr Putin to focus his group’s operations in Africa, propping up regimes and securing resources for Russia.  Following Prigozhin's death, deputy Defence Minister Yunus-Bek Yevkurov reportedly toured African capitals, assuring officials that the services provided by the group would not dissipate. Earlier this month the Polish Institute of International Affairs (PISM) think tank observed that in the wake of Prigozhin's death ""the Russian state’s attention in [Africa] not only did not weaken, but strengthened"".  In February, the BBC obtained documents revealing that Moscow was offering a “regime survival package” in exchange for access to strategically important natural resources – an approach previously favoured by the Wagner Group. The plan was being offered by a so-called Russian “expeditionary group” – nicknamed the Africa Corps – and commanded by former GRU Gen Andrey Averyanov. He previously oversaw secretive operations specialising in targeting killings and destabilising foreign governments. Experts told the BBC that the Africa Corps has effectively replaced Wagner in West Africa. On Telegram, the unit boasted of offering recruits salaries of up to 110,000 roubles a month ($1,250; £990) and service “under the leadership of competent commanders with extensive combat experience”. In January, it announced its first deployment of 100 troops to Burkina Faso. Another 100 reportedly arrived in Niger in April. Ruslan Trad, a security analyst with the Atlantic Council, told the BBC that, in effect, Wagner ""became the Africa Corps and now serves the full purposes of military intelligence"" and the ministry of defence.  ""In Africa, these soldiers are doing much the same thing - guarding trade routes, securing resources that Moscow uses to circumvent sanctions, and more - serving local juntas and directing the flow of migrants,"" he observed.  The PISM noted that the Africa Corps is intended to be used ""more openly"" than Wagner was on the continent with the intention of replacing Western - and particularly French - influence in Africa.  BBC Russian reported that only in the Central African Republic (CAR) is Wagner still operating in any shadow of its former shape, allegedly controlled by Prigozhin’s son Pavel. ""Moscow has given the heir the go-ahead to continue doing what his father did in Africa, on condition that it does not contradict Russia's interests,"" a source who used to work with Yevgeny Prigozhin told BBC Russian. Last week, Le Monde reported that around 1,500 Wagner troops had assisted local security forces in attacks on rebel-held areas.  However, the PISM observed that the overall importance of the CAR in Moscow's strategic thinking ""is diminishing"".  Dr MacLeod suggested that Wagner's original goal in the CAR had been to show ""proof of concept"" that mercenary groups can be ""used as a successful counter-terrorism actor"", a goal Moscow may now view as having been achieved.  But she added that Wagner was ""utterly enmeshed"" within the CAR, making it harder to replace it with the new, developing Africa Corps.  Despite the threat posed by Prigozhin's mutiny, Sunday's anniversary largely passed without incident in Russia.  Dan Storyev of the OVD-Info monitoring group told the BBC that Prigozhin's legacy mostly lay with those aligned with the Kremlin.  ""Generally speaking the Wagner mutiny hasn’t had much, if any, real grassroots support for there to be, say, mass rallies marking the anniversary - perhaps because it had no genuine anti-war messaging,"" he noted.  ""There are people who organise protests in Russia, but they’re focused on anti-war activism and don’t have anything to do with [Prigozhin]."" "
geopolitical tensions,The new top nation for tourism in 2024,2024-09-15,2024-06-17,Lindsey Galloway,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20240617-why-the-us-is-the-top-country-for-tourism-in-2024,"A new report published by the World Economic Forum highlights the nation's promotion of natural and cultural resources and commitment to sustainability and tourism. Though it's been a bumpy four years for the travel industry, international tourist arrivals are finally set to reach pre-pandemic levels in 2024. But continued global travel growth is far from a sure thing, thanks to inflation, climate change and geopolitical tensions, which keep the sector in a tenuous spot. Yet, certain countries and governments have done a better job minimising those risks and maximising their travel and tourism potential, according to the Travel & Tourism Development Index 2024, which was published last month by the World Economic Forum. The index ranks countries around the world based on factors like safety and security, prioritisation of travel and tourism, air and ground travel infrastructure, natural and cultural resources and sustainability. This year's rankings saw Spain, Japan (last year's winner), France and Australia ranked in the top five, and a newcomer at the top of the list: the United States, which outperformed the global competition with its scores for its business environment, air transport infrastructure and natural resources. The high scores are a reflection of the country's robust infrastructure, ease of travel between cities, diverse natural and cultural destinations and traveller-friendly resources – such as guides to cities, parks and other attractions.   ""While obvious reasons for this accolade exist, such as its diverse landscapes, natural beauty and cultural richness, the US also boasts a well-developed infrastructure supporting the travel and tourism sector,"" says Anna Abelson, an adjunct instructor at New York University's SPS Tisch Center of Hospitality. That infrastructure bolsters a lot of spending power. According to the United States Travel Association's (USTA) biannual US travel forecast, prior to the pandemic, international visitors spent $180bn in the US in 2019, generating nearly $2 trillion in economic output. To put that in perspective, France – the world's most-visited country, which received 90 million visitors in 2019 compared to 79.4 million in the US – saw roughly $61bn (€56bn) in revenue from international tourism that year. While that $180bn number dipped during the pandemic, the USTA notes that visitor levels are set to recover by 2025. Compared to other countries, the US federal government provides broad support for travel and tourism, especially in maintaining and regulating the strong airport infrastructure and airline industry. Yet, experts say much of the country's travel and tourism success can be traced back to the diversity of its cities – both big and small – and the time and financial investment they've each made in crafting long-term sustainable tourism plans. With bigger budgets and staff, the US's largest cities have made strong pushes to stay on the minds and the maps of international travellers – and those big bets are paying off. ""For decades, major cities in the US like [Las] Vegas and New York have taken a proactive and aggressive approach to marketing their destinations with strong branding in a way that lasts and resonates with consumers,"" said Taryn Scher, founder of TK Public Relations, that represents destinations like Greenville, South Carolina, and Macon, Georgia. ""You know the taglines. There's no question this leads to increased tourism in their respective cities."" The US's global mega events – think Coachella, the Super Bowl and Mardi Gras – also draw visitors from around the globe, says Scher. The vast US National Parks System, whose 63 parks and 54 million acres (which is nearly as large as the entire United Kingdom), can't be overstated in terms of its global appeal. ""The USA is blessed with more variety of landscapes and interesting cities than any country on the planet, from mountains, desert, tropics, swamp,"" said Tim Leffel, author of the book and online resources The World's Cheapest Destinations. ""New Orleans, New York City, Santa Fe, Alaska and Florida are more different than most countries are."" Big or small, the US travel industry doesn't see tourism as a zero-sum game. The top 10 countries for tourism Source: World Economic Forum's Travel & Tourism Development Index 2024 ""One of the driving factors to the success of the travel industry in the United States is the collaborative efforts between the local, regional and state tourism organisations,"" said Danielle Borja, President/CEO of Visit Conejo Valley. More like this:  • Five standout cities making the world a better place  • Why does Canada have three of the world's most liveable cities? • The world's most gender-equal countries For instance, Borja notes that Visit California recently launched The Ultimate Playground campaign to showcase its outdoor, cultural and wellness activities across the state. But it gave the opportunity for industry partners, like Visit Conejo Valley, to highlight more playful activities like a new Star Wars exhibit at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library & Museum. Tourism entities like this often also partner with private businesses like restaurants and privately owned attractions, which serves as a positive aspect of the US tourism industry. According to the World Travel & Tourism Council, a clash between the governmental ""enforcer"" role and privately owned businesses can hinder collaboration and misalign priorities, but this problem is less pronounced in the US. Scher also notes how the rise of US cities that have traditionally received fewer international tourists have seen their visitor numbers grow. ""More recently, places like Tampa, Savannah, Cincinnati, Indianapolis [and] Louisville have found a way to craft their messaging to bring brand awareness and do so in an aggressive yet strategic fashion,"" she said. As a 20-year industry veteran, Scher believes that the US has been able to maintain its strong travel growth trajectory because each bureau in each state and city prioritises its marketing efforts. ""We've seen a huge rise in interest in these smaller and lesser-known destinations,"" said Scher. ""They became popular during the pandemic when people were looking for less-populated places to visit, and now the smart destinations who saw that rise realise there is real money in tourism."" The investment doesn't always happen overnight, but places like Charleston and Napa Valley have both benefited from a long-term strategy, and how it can impact a city's entire economy. ""More visitors means more spending in local restaurants, shops and hotels,"" said Scher. ""Every $1 visitors spend locally is multiplied and stays in the community, therefore leading to a dramatic direct economic impact. Tourism booms lead to more jobs and opportunities in communities."" According to Leffel, some of the US's tourism success just comes from good old-fashioned work ethic, organisational efficiency and reliable communication. ""USA tourism boards reply to journalists, they follow through on marketing campaigns, they go to conferences to get better at their job and find people to collaborate with,"" he said. ""They look at ROI [return on investment] and what's working so they can improve their campaigns the following year. They benchmark and look at what others are having success with. They look outward beyond their borders regularly and don't stay content with marketing to a captive domestic traveller base."" Leffel points to the growth of the annual IPW conference, one of the world's largest inbound travel trade shows, that takes credit for billions of future travel dollars by tracking sales of US travel products like accommodations, destinations and attractions to travel buyers like international tour operators. According to Abelson, US-based visitor bureaus and destination management organisations also tend to have robust information hubs that are supported by a strong digital presence. ""Training and education for tourism professionals have been evolving in response to industry needs and trends,"" she said. The pandemic accelerated trends like travel tech adoption (think: room service robots), and new technologies like AI are expected to change how travellers research and book travel – and the US typically has an edge as an early technology adopter and risk-taker when compared to other countries. Training has also been bolstered by industry support, especially by organisations like Brand USA and the USTA, which work to promote the United States as a top travel destination and communicate visa and entry policies. The US has never been known for its subtlety or for doing things on a small scale, and when it comes to its tourism offerings, this formula has proven to be a strength. ""When the USA latches onto a trend, it doesn't stop until it's saturated. Witness wine, craft beer and coffee, or museums, concerts, and activities for children in cities,"" said Leffel. ""We don't stop until we've passed everyone else in quality or variety."" -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

geopolitical tensions,Eurozone cuts interest rate for first time in 5 years,2024-09-15,2024-06-06,Lucy Hooker,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c511jy6z41vo,"The EU has become the second major global economy to cut its lending rate this week, saying it had made progress in tackling inflation. The European Central Bank (ECB) announced a cut in its main interest rate from an all-time high of 4% to 3.75%. That follows Canada's decision on Wednesday to cut its official lending rate. The ECB's move comes as voters head to the polls for EU-wide elections over the next four days, with the outcome expected to reflect people's unhappiness over cost-of-living pressures. Christine Lagarde, president of the ECB said the outlook for inflation had improved ""markedly"", paving the way for the rate cut. However, she warned that inflation was likely to remain above the bank’s 2% target “well into next year”, averaging 2.5% in 2024 and 2.2% in 2025. The ECB would keep interest rate policy ""sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary"" to bring inflation down to the Bank's 2% target, she said. However, she added: ""We are not pre-committing to a particular rate path."" Lindsay James, investment strategist at Quilter Investors said the rate cut had been widely anticipated but would nevertheless come as a relief to consumers and businesses on the continent. “The ECB has stolen a march on the Bank of England and [US] Federal Reserve – who are both potentially still a few months away from cutting – and will breathe life into an economy that desperately needs some form of stimulus,"" she said. Central banks have kept rates high for the past two years to bear down on the rate at which prices are rising, with most targeting an annual inflation rate of 2%. But higher interest rates tend to dampen economic growth. A cut in interest rates should boost economic activity by making it cheaper for consumers and businesses to borrow. Meeting in Frankfurt on Thursday, the EU's rate-setting body decided to cut rates, despite a slight uptick in inflation in May. Inflation rose to 2.6%, from 2.4% in April in the 27-nation bloc. The ECB's decision followed Canada's rate cut on Wednesday which brought its headline rate down from 5% to 4.75%, after inflation there fell to 2.7%. Sweden and Switzerland have also trimmed rates. Ms Largarde gave a broader assessment of the eurozone's economic outlook. She said: ""Our overall confidence in the path ahead — because we have to be forward looking — has been increasing."" But she also warned of potential “bumps in the road” ahead for the region. “The risks to economic growth are balanced in the near term, but remain tilted to the downside over the medium term,” she said, citing conflict in Ukraine and the Middle East. Geopolitical tensions could weigh on growth, while extreme weather events and the climate crisis more broadly could drive up food prices, she warned. However, Katherine Neiss, chief European economist at investment firm PGIM said she was ""reasonably confident"" that the ECB would cut rates further over the summer or autumn, resulting in eurozone rates that were at 3.5% or lower by the end of the year. ""Growth is encouragingly recovering from the recession that the euro area went through towards the end of last year, but it's still sluggish,"" she told the BBC's Today Programme.  That factor, combined with slowing inflation and easing wage growth, would justify another rate cut, she said.  UK rates have yet to start coming down, although there is some speculation the Bank of England could trim them as early as this month.  UK inflation has fallen to 2.3%, a long way down from its peak of over 11% in late 2022. Last month, the International Monetary Fund suggested the Bank of England should cut rates from their current 5.25% to 3.5% by the end of next year. However, George Godber from Polar Capital said the upcoming election in the UK would ""complicate"" the Bank of England's next decision on 20 June.  The Bank is politically independent, but the Conservative government had made falling interest rates part of their promise to voters, which could influence ""mindsets"", Mr Godber said. ""If they cut it'll be political, if they don’t cut it'll be political,"" he said. The US Federal Reserve is also expected to cut rates in the coming months, although the latest US inflation figure is higher, at 3.4%. The Fed was likely to make its first move on rates ahead of the immediate run-up to voting in November, Mr Godber said."
geopolitical tensions,Why is Nvidia boss the 'Taylor Swift of tech'?,2024-09-15,2024-06-07,Annabelle Liang,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq55ek28z98o,"These days, wherever Jensen Huang goes, crowds chant his name and scramble for selfies and autographs. He is not your usual celebrity - rather, the 61-year-old electrical engineer is the chief executive of Nvidia, the chip powerhouse whose value just surged past $3tn (£2.3tn), briefly overtaking Apple as the world's second-most valuable company, before pulling back. “He is literally being treated like a rock star,” says technology analyst Bob O’Donnell. “Jensen sees this opportunity to build on Nvidia. He’s obviously enjoying the moment."" His new-found status, complete with an embossed $9,000 Tom Ford biker jacket, was on display this week at Computex in Taiwan - the annual tech conference draws the world's biggest companies to the island.    Mr Huang, who was born in Taiwan but left when he was just five years old, posed for countless pictures and even scrawled his name on a woman's top at the conference, wondering aloud if this was a ""good idea"". It was, in the words of local media, pure ""Jensanity"". This comes as US regulators are reportedly planning to open an investigation into big tech, including Nvidia, over its dominance over the AI industry.  The interest Mr Huang has stirred has not been lost on his peers - Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, responding to a social media follower who did not know who Mr Huang was, described him as “Taylor Swift, but for tech”. Mr Huang is at the forefront of a technology boom, and his rise has coincided with Nvidia's emergence as the leading designer of AI chips. Taiwanese chipmaking giant TSMC is the sole production partner for Nvidia’s cutting-edge AI chips. And Nvidia's success has been a boost for TSMC, whose shares hit a record high on Thursday. High-end chips, including those used for AI, have become a source of geopolitcial tension as the US and China race to master production. But it's Taiwan that currently sits at the top of that game - it makes nearly all of the world's most advanced chips.   All of this has generated a lot of buzz around Mr Huang and the company he founded decades ago. His success is also a matter of pride for Taiwan, a self-ruled island which Beijing claims.  As those claims have become more aggressive, Taiwan's chip exports have both become a lifeline and a tool of soft power.  ""In Taiwan, he’s also the local boy done good. That is something people can rally around,"" Mr O'Donnell said.  Although he lives in Santa Clara in California where Nvidia is headquartered, Mr Huang frequently visits Taiwan. He has always emphasised that Nvidia would continue investing in the island.  Just this week, he told reporters that the company plans to build regional headquarters in Taiwan, which is welcome news for the island. It has been concerned about chip production moving overseas as manufacturers look for alternative supply routes that would be safe in case of a Chinese invasion.      And of course, there is the success of Nvidia itself. Shares have gone up by more than 200% over the last year.  The firm has been catapulted into tech stardom as AI and the chips that power it become as cool as any fancy new gadget.  Mr Huang knows this well. He has been fronting Nvidia's chip launches and they have been likened to massively-watched Apple events.  In Taiwan, where he launched new products, he spoke for two hours about the company's history.  “Nvidia’s last big conference in San Jose was in a stadium. It was jam-packed and huge lines of people couldn’t get in. It was like a rock concert,” Mr O’Donnell said. “This time, he spoke in a sports stadium in Taiwan. I joked that he was on his arena tour.” For one, Mr Huang loves his leather jackets. He credits his wife and daughter for making it his signature style.  A spokesperson from Nvidia says he been wearing one for more than two decades now. His latest pick from Tom Ford is from the fashion house's 2023 season - and he has kept it on even during visits to humid Singapore. “Leather jackets can signal an edge: a willingness to break rules, do things differently and challenge the status quo,” says fashion stylist Sera Murphy. “Jensen’s signature style gives him a casual, approachable energy,” she adds. Signature styles are not uncommon among tech CEOs. Apple co-founder Steve Jobs was known for the outfit he wore all the time - black St. Croix mock turtleneck sweater, blue Levi's 501 jeans, and New Balance 991 trainers. Mr Zuckerberg is usually in plain sweaters and t-shirts from luxury fashion brands.  “Uniform dressing” can help entrepreneurs create an image of stability around their companies, Ms Murphy says.  “People need consistency from leaders. Dressing in a uniform makes things predictable in a market that is volatile and unpredictable.""  His leather jacket aside, Mr Huang fits the description of a tech geek.  He was nine years old when his family moved to the West Coast in the US. He graduated as an electrical engineer from Oregon State University, and then with a masters degree in the same field from Stanford University.  He married his college sweetheart and lab partner, Lori Mills, also an electrical engineer. The couple have two children.  He worked at US chip firm AMD before co-founding Nvidia in 1993. The company was originally known for chips that process graphics, particularly for computer games. Eventually it changed focus to AI, a field it now dominates. Interest in AI skyrocketed after the 2022 launch of ChatGPT. The chatbot was trained using 10,000 of Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs), clustered together in a supercomputer. This propelled Nvidia to the elite club of US companies worth at least $1tn last May, joining the likes of Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Microsoft.  Nvidia is now the world's third-most valuable company, after Microsoft and Apple.  Mr Huang himself has a net worth of around $106bn, according to Forbes, making him the 14th richest person in the world. Mr O’Donnell says Mr Huang is likely to keep appearing at events, seeking to drum up Nvidia's brand.  “At technology conferences, everyone wants Jensen on stage and he’s happy to join. What he has done makes him appear everywhere. He’s positioned himself as the figurehead of generative AI,” Mr O’Donnell says. “The issue is the industry does not like monopolies. Nvidia has a huge market share, but competitors like AMD and Intel are starting to catch up."""
geopolitical tensions,Google to make Pixel phones and drones in India,2024-09-15,2024-05-24,Cherylann Mollan,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq55z7ynjyro,"Tech giant Google will soon begin making its Pixel smartphones in India, sources aware of the development have told the BBC. Google is set to manufacture the phones at an existing Foxconn facility in the southern state of Tamil Nadu. The firm is also set to independently manufacture drones in the state. India has emerged as a key destination for global firms looking to diversify supply lines outside China in the midst of geopolitical tensions with the West. Last year, Google had announced plans to make Pixel smartphones in India, beginning with the Pixel 8. ""India is a priority market for Pixel smartphones, and we’re committed to bringing the best of our hardware and underlying built-in software capabilities to people across the country,"" it said in a blog post. On Friday, sources told the BBC that Alphabet's Google would make advanced versions of Pixel smartphones at the Tamil Nadu facility and that manufacturing would begin within this calendar year. Google and Foxconn have signed a contract to this end, the source said. Foxconn currently has two facilities in Tamil Nadu. At one of its facilities near Chennai city, it assembles Apple's iPhones.  Google's decision to make Pixel phones in Tamil Nadu came after state officials met company executives recently. According to a statement from the Tamil Nadu government, officials from Google are also set to meet state Chief Minister MK Stalin in Chennai soon."
geopolitical tensions,Council to ask government to 'spread out' solar farms,2024-09-15,2024-05-22,Sophie Parker,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c144l20rnjwo,"A council has agreed to write to the government asking it to make sure solar farms are spread ""more evenly"" across the UK. Many councillors in Wiltshire feel the county has taken more than its fair share, with more than 40 solar farms, and villages such as Whitley, Potterne and Broughton Gifford, feeling ""surrounded"". Cabinet member for strategic planning Nick Botterill, who brought the motion to make the call on government, said they are not being ""alarmist"" with the request. Last week the government said planning authorities must consider the cumulative impact when several proposals come up in the same area. Council members voted on Wednesday to call on the government to ensure that solar farms are “more evenly spread across the UK” and “not concentrated in specific areas effectively industrialising the countryside"". Council leader Richard Clewer emphasised that they are not opposed to solar farms, but agreed they need more detail and a better explanation of what the government means by ""cumulative impact"". The debate was held weeks after a public consultation on what would be one of the biggest solar farms in the country ended. The Lime Down project would see solar panels on 2,000 acres of farmland across six villages in Wiltshire. Sir Michael Pitt, a former CEO of the Planning Inspectorate, spoke on behalf of the Stop Lime Down group, which supported the motion to write to the government. He called the Lime Down proposal a ""highly damaging assault on the county's landscape and way of life"" and added that ""future generations would wonder why we haven't taken greater care of the county"". While most of those attending the meeting said they supported solar power overall, they said the panels should be placed on brownfield sites or rooftops. Peter Richardson, a parish councillor for Whitley near Melksham, said that if Lime Down were to go ahead, the village would ""be completely surrounded by solar farms and associated infrastructure"". The battery storage for the proposals would be in the village, with residents also concerned about the possibility of battery-related fires.  Meanwhile, Chippenham town councillor and part of the Wiltshire Climate Alliance, Matthew Short, said that while he agreed there should be more solar on rooftops, this would not ""match the scale of the problem"". He added that solar could actually benefit the soil and wildlife on poorer quality farmland and that supporting solar projects is ""critical for energy security"". The developer behind the Lime Down scheme, Island Green Power, told the BBC that it ""recognises the importance of carefully balancing renewable energy initiatives with the need to preserve the aesthetic and environmental integrity of the areas where we operate"". It added that it wants to ""minimise negative impacts and maximise positive impacts on the local environment and local community as far as is possible"". Energy Security Secretary Claire Coutinho told Parliament on 15 May that with growing geopolitical tension, the best agricultural land must be protected for food security. She also reinforced the weight of planning policy and the need for solar to be delivered in a sensible way – ensuring developers and planning authorities consider the cumulative impact solar projects can have on local communities.

geopolitical tensions,Solar farms 'avoid quality farmland' - trade group,2024-09-15,2024-05-19,David Macmillan,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cll4yl1rqymo,"Solar farms are only built on good quality farmland when ""absolutely needed for the connection to the grid"", a trade association has insisted. Plans in County Durham have encountered controversy, in the week the government announced it was planning to tighten rules on where they could be built. A planning application for a major solar farm in Burnhope was quashed after a resident, who said the land should be used to produce food, won a legal challenge against it. Solar Energy UK, which represents solar farm businesses, said the industry's targets for solar by 2035 only require a ""very tiny proportion of the UK's land"". Burnhope is one of several areas in County Durham where there are plans to build a major solar farm. Lightsource bp said its farm would cover 215 acres and generate 49.9MW of electricity, which would be enough to power nearly 14,000 homes for a year. It said it was ""disappointed"" by the decision but respected the court’s decision. The plans are currently on hold. Burnhope resident Ian Galloway won a legal challenge against the solar farm. Mr Galloway said: ""They're industrialising the environment, they'll destroy the soil, it'll be a nightmare."" His wife Heather said the plans were ""too big"" and ""in the wrong place"".  She added: ""Solar power is one way to generate electricity but you can put it in brownfield sites, this [Burnhope] is beautiful green and if we lose that, it's not coming back."" A spokesperson for Lightsource bp said it had ""worked hard to tailor the design to the environment and to mitigate any concerns"". ""The land selected for the Burnhope solar project includes brownfield land that was previous an open-cast mine. The landowners report that the productivity of the land has been exceedingly low."" Chris Hewett, from Solar Energy UK, said industry targets for solar by 2035 will only require a ""very tiny proportion of the UK's land"". ""In fact, in County Durham, we're only looking at 0.03% of total land area, so it's a very small amount,"" he added. Last week, the energy security secretary told Parliament that with growing geopolitical tension, the best agricultural land must be protected for food security. Mr Hewett insisted the solar industry supported food security. ""If you're a farmer and you have solar on your land, that gives you an extra revenue stream which often allows you to maintain investing in food production in other parts of your land,"" he added.

geopolitical tensions,EU lodges complaint with Eurovision over flag ban,2024-09-15,2024-05-13,Nadia Ragozhina,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cw4dd9lzx02o,"The European Union has lodged an official complaint with the organisers of the Eurovision Song Contest over its refusal to let participants wave the bloc's flag at last Saturday's final.  ""Such actions cast a shadow over what is meant to be a joyous occasion for peoples across Europe,"" European Commission Vice-President Margaritis Schinas wrote to the European Broadcasting Union (EBU). The complaint comes after politician Dorin Frasineanu from the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party said he had been ""denied entry to Eurovision with the EU flag"". According to EBU rules only flags of ""participating countries and the rainbow/pride flags"" are allowed inside the contest venue.  A spokesperson for the EBU said the flag policy this year was ""the same as 2023"".  ""With the EU being targeted by malicious and authoritarian actors, EBU's decision contributed to discrediting a symbol that brings together all Europeans,"" said Mr Schinas in his complaint. He demanded the broadcaster ""explain the rationale behind this decision and attribute responsibility where it is due"". ""The incoherence in the EBU's stance left myself and millions of viewers wondering for what and for whom the Eurovision Song Contest stands,"" Mr Schinas added. Speaking to reporters on Monday afternoon, European Commission spokesperson Eric Mamer said it was ""completely regrettable that the flag of all the EU members taking part in the competition... could not be shown"". The European Commission will ""make the point very clearly that there's no reason not to allow this flag, in fact we would encourage the EBU to allow and ensure it is shown"", Mr Mamer said.  He also clarified that as the Eurovision Song Contest was not organised by the EU, they could only make their views known and encourage the EBU to ""understand it was a mistake"". In an interview with Politico, Mr Schinas said the EBU's decision to ban EU flags during Saturday's Eurovision final was a gift to ""the enemies of Europe"".  “Who wins from banning the EU flag from Eurovision?” the commissioner added. “Only the Eurosceptics and the enemies of Europe.” In a statement to the BBC, the EBU said the flag policy had been agreed with SVT, the Swedish broadcaster and host of this year's contest, but stressed this did not feature an explicit provision to ban EU flags.  ""As in previous years such as 2023, SVT's policy was to allow the flags of the participating countries and the rainbow flags.  ""There has never been an express ban on the EU flag in the written policy,"" an EBU spokesperson said.  ""Due to heightened geopolitical tensions, the flag policy was more rigorously enforced by security at this year's event."" MEP and former Belgian Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt wrote on X: ""As the EU flag is banned from Eurovision, people risk being beaten to demand a European path for Georgia.  ""Freedom, democracy can never be taken for granted!"" The row follows a string of controversies that marred this year's song contest, including the last-minute expulsion of Dutch entrant Joost Klein, the withdrawal of a contestant from rehearsals and another contestant breaking the rules with an on-stage speech calling for peace.  There were also tensions over Israel's presence in the competition and pro-Palestinian protests outside the venue. The EU flag was not the only one under scrutiny, with the contest's winner Nemo - a 24-year-old Swiss musician who uses they/them pronouns - said they had to smuggle their own non-binary flag into the venue because Eurovision had refused to allow it. Nemo said they ""did it anyway"", before calling out the ""double standards"" of the organisers who were reported to have forced some fans to throw away their non-binary flags before being allowed in.

geopolitical tensions,Tensions grow as China ramps up mining for green tech,2024-09-15,2024-04-29,By Global China Unit,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-68896707,"Earlier this year, Ai Qing was woken up in the middle of the night by angry chants outside her dormitory in northern Argentina.  She peered out of the window to see Argentine workers surrounding the compound and blockading the entrance with flaming tyres.  ""It was getting scary because I could see the sky being lit up by the fire. It had become a riot,"" says Ms Ai, who works for a Chinese company extracting lithium from salt flats in the Andes mountains, for use in batteries.  The protest, sparked by the firing of a number of Argentine staff, is just one of a growing number of cases of friction between Chinese businesses and host communities, as China - which already dominates the processing of minerals vital to the green economy - expands its involvement in mining them.   It was just 10 years ago that a Chinese company bought the country's first stake in an extraction project within the ""lithium triangle"" of Argentina, Bolivia and Chile, which holds most of the world's lithium reserves.  Many further Chinese investments in local mining operations have followed, according to mining publications, and corporate, government and media reports. The BBC calculates that based on their shareholdings, Chinese companies now control an estimated 33% of the lithium at projects currently producing the mineral or those under construction.  But as Chinese businesses have expanded, they have faced allegations of abuses similar to those often levelled at other international mining giants.  For Ai Qing, the tyre-burning protest was a rude awakening. She had expected a quiet life in Argentina, but found herself involved in conflict mediation because of her knowledge of Spanish.  ""It wasn't easy,"" she says.  ""Beyond the language, we have to tone down many things, like how management thinks the employees are simply lazy and too reliant on the union, and how locals think Chinese people are only here to exploit them.""  The BBC Global China Unit has identified at least 62 mining projects across the world, in which Chinese companies have a stake, that are designed to extract either lithium or one of three other minerals key to green technologies - cobalt, nickel and manganese.  All are used to make lithium-ion batteries - used in electric vehicles - which, along with solar panels, are now high industrial priorities for China. Some projects are among the largest producers of these minerals in the world.   China has long been a leader in refining lithium and cobalt, with a share of global supply reaching 72% and 68% respectively in 2022, according to the Chatham House think tank.  Its capacity to refine these and other critical minerals has helped the country reach a point where it made more than half of the electric vehicles sold worldwide in 2023, has 60% of the global manufacturing capacity for wind turbines, and controls at least 80% of each stage in the solar panel supply chain.    China's role in the sector has made these items cheaper and more accessible globally.  But it's not only China that will need to mine and process minerals needed for the green economy. The UN says that if the world is to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, their use must increase six-fold by 2040.  The US, the UK and the European Union have all developed strategies, meanwhile, to reduce their dependence on Chinese supplies.   As Chinese companies have increased their overseas mining operations, allegations of problems caused by these projects have steadily risen.  The Business and Human Rights Resource Centre, an NGO, says such troubles are ""not unique to Chinese mining"" but last year it published a report listing 102 allegations made against Chinese companies involved in extracting critical minerals, ranging from violations of the rights of local communities to damage to ecosystems and unsafe working conditions.   These allegations dated from 2021 and 2022. The BBC has counted more than 40 further allegations that were made in 2023, and reported by NGOs or in the media.   People in two countries, on opposite sides of the world, also told us their stories.   On the outskirts of Lubumbashi in the far south of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Christophe Kabwita has been leading opposition to the Ruashi cobalt mine, owned by the Jinchuan Group since 2011.  He says the open-pit mine, situated 500m from his doorstep, blights people's lives by using explosives to blast away at the rock two or three times per week. Sirens wail when the blasting is about to start, as a signal for everyone to stop what they are doing and take cover.   ""Whatever the temperature, whether it's raining or a gale is blowing, we have to leave our homes and go to a shelter near the mine,"" he says.  This applies to everyone, including the sick and women who have just given birth, he adds, as nowhere else is safe.  In 2017 a teenage girl, Katty Kabazo, was reportedly killed by a flying rock on her way home from school, while other rocks are said to have punched holes into the walls and roofs of local houses.  A spokesperson from the Ruashi mine, Elisa Kalasa, acknowledged that ""one young kid was in that area - she was not supposed to be there and was affected by the flying rocks"".     She said that since then ""we have improved the technology, and now we have the sort of blasting where there are no flying rocks any more"".   However, the BBC spoke to a processing manager at the company, Patrick Tshisand, who appeared to give a different picture. He said: ""If we mine, we use explosives. Explosives can cause flying rocks, which can end up in the community because the community is too close to the mine... so we had several accidents like that.""     Ms Kalasa also said that between 2006 and 2012 the company compensated more than 300 families to relocate further away from the mine.  On Indonesia's remote Obi Island, a mine jointly owned by a Chinese company, Lygend Resources and Technology, and Indonesian mining giant Harita Group has rapidly swallowed up the forests around the village of Kawasi.    Jatam, a local mining watchdog, says that villagers have been under pressure to move and accept government compensation. Dozens of families have refused to relocate, saying what is on offer is below market value. As a result, some say they have been threatened with legal action for allegedly disrupting a project of national strategic importance.    Jatam says old-growth forests have been logged to make way for the mine and they've documented how the rivers and ocean have been filled with sediment, polluting what was once a pristine marine environment.     ""The water from the river is undrinkable now, it's so contaminated, and the sea, that is usually clear blue, turns red when it rains,"" Nur Hayati, a teacher who lives in Kawasi village, says.      Indonesian soldiers have been deployed to the island to protect the mine and when the BBC visited recently, there was a noticeable, increased military presence. Jatam claims soldiers are being used to intimidate, and even assault, people who speak out against the mine. Ms Nur says her community feels the army is there to ""protect the interests of the mine, not the welfare of their own people"".  The military's spokesperson in Jakarta said allegations of intimidation ""cannot be proven"" and that while the soldiers were there to ""protect the mine"" they were not there to ""directly interact with locals"".   In a statement, he claimed the relocation of villagers to make way for the mine had been overseen by the police in a ""peaceful and smooth manner"".   Ms Nur was among a group of villagers who travelled to the Indonesian capital, Jakarta, in June 2018, to protest against the impact of the mine. But a local government representative, Samsu Abubakar, told the BBC no complaints had been received from the public about environmental damage.     He also shared an official report that concluded Harita Group had been ""compliant with environmental management and monitoring obligations"".     Harita itself told us that it ""adheres strictly to ethical business practices and local laws"" and it is ""continuously working to address and mitigate any negative impacts"".  It claimed it had not caused widespread deforestation, it monitored the local source of drinking water, and independent tests have confirmed the water met government quality standards. It added that it had not carried out forced evictions or unfair land transactions and had not intimidated anyone.     A year ago, the Chinese mining trade body, known as CCCMC, started setting up a grievance mechanism, intended to resolve complaints made against Chinese-owned mining projects. The companies themselves ""lack the ability - both cultural and linguistic"" to interact with local communities or civil society organisations, says a spokesperson, Lelia Li.   However, the mechanism still isn't fully operating.  Meanwhile, China's involvement in foreign mining operations seems certain to increase. It's not just a ""geopolitical play"" to control a key market, says Aditya Lolla, the Asia programme director at Ember, a UK-based environmental think tank, it also makes sense from a business perspective.   ""Acquisitions are being made by Chinese companies because, for them, it's all about profits,"" he says.  As a result, Chinese workers will continue to be sent to mining projects around the world and for them, these projects mostly present a chance to earn good money.  People such as Wang Gang, who has worked for 10 years in Chinese-owned cobalt mines in DR Congo. The 48-year-old lives in company accommodation and eats in the staff canteen, working 10-hour days, seven days a week, with four days' leave per month.   He accepts the separation from his family in Hubei province, because he earns more than he could at home. He also enjoys the clear skies and tall forests of DR Congo.   He communicates with local mine workers in a mixture of French, Swahili, and English, but says: ""We rarely chat, except for work-related matters.""   Even Ai Qing, who speaks the language of her host country fluently, has little interaction with Argentines outside work. She's started seeing a fellow Chinese worker, and they mostly hang out with other people like themselves - being thousands of miles from home pulls everyone closer.   A highlight for her is visiting the salt flats high up in the Andes where the lithium is mined and life is ""chill"".    ""The altitude sickness always gets me - I can't fall asleep and I can't eat,"" she says. ""But I really do enjoy going up there because things are much simpler, and there are no office politics.""   Ai Qing and Wang Gang are pseudonyms  Additional reporting by Emery Makumeno, Byobe Malenga, Lucien Kahozy"
geopolitical tensions,UK forecast to have slowest growth in G7 next year,2024-09-15,2022-04-19,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-61142906,"The war in Ukraine will ""severely set back"" the global economic recovery with the UK hit harder than most, the International Monetary Fund has said.  The conflict is driving up prices for food and fuel which the international body expects to slow growth globally. It has cut its global forecast and also downgraded its outlook for the UK. This means the UK will no longer be the fastest growing economy in the G7 group of leading Western nations, and will be the slowest in 2023, it says. The body says that UK growth will slow as price pressures lead households to cut spending, while rising interest rates are expected to ""cool investment"". The UK's economy is now predicted to grow by 3.7% this year, down from the previous forecast of 4.7% made in January. However, next year, the UK is expected to have the slowest growth in the G7 and across Europe's main economies, at just 1.2%, a near halving from the 2.3% expected previously. The 2023 UK figure is the slowest apart from heavily-sanctioned Russia in the wider G20 grouping, which includes nations such as China and India. The IMF said that the UK was the fastest growing G7 economy in 2021, and is forecast to be the second fastest in 2022. The low UK growth rates forecast in 2023 are in part due to the UK rebounding more quickly from the pandemic than some of its G7 peers. However, the UK is also wrestling with high inflation, which will hit growth in 2023, as people cut spending as their real income shrinks, the IMF said. The organisation expects inflation to peak in late 2022 at 9%. It said rising interest rates will also slow the UK economy in 2023 and 2023, while government policies such as getting rid of certain tax breaks will reduce business investment at that time. In addition, Brexit will hold back export growth, the IMF said, and it will continue to make pandemic-related labour supply ""scarring"" worse by reducing immigration. ""However, the impact of Brexit is spread over several years and is not the primary driver of the slowdown in 2023,"" a spokesperson for the organisation added. The IMF works with its 189 member countries to try to stabilise the global economy, including issuing short-term loans and assistance to countries who are struggling. It said inflation was now a ""clear and present danger"" in many countries and the situation has added to supply strains from the coronavirus pandemic. ""In the matter of a few weeks, the world has yet again experienced a major, transformative shock,"" IMF director of research Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas wrote in the organisation's 2022 World Economic Outlook. ""Just as a durable recovery from the pandemic-induced global economic collapse appeared in sight, the war has created the very real prospect that a large part of the recent gains will be erased.""  The organisation said it expected global growth of just 3.6% this year, down nearly a percentage point from its forecast before the war.  The World Bank also said it was lowering its growth forecast from 4.1% to 3.2%.  The conflict has already devastated the economies of Ukraine and Russia, which the West cut off from key trade and financial networks with sanctions following the invasion. Ukraine is facing a severe contraction of 35% or more this year, while Russia's economy is expected to shrink by 8.5%, the IMF said. But with Russia a major energy producer and key supplier of staples such as wheat and corn alongside Ukraine, the consequences will ripple far beyond their borders, the IMF warned. There have been two acute shocks to the world economy in quick succession - the pandemic and the Ukraine war. The latter is building on the problems created by the former, tripping up what had been a healthy recovery, and sending prices rising at an even faster rate. Food and energy prices were already being hiked by the supply bottlenecks after the pandemic, before one of the world's biggest energy suppliers invaded one of the world's biggest food exporter. But now there are new bottlenecks emerging from the stringent Covid lockdowns in some regions of China. Rising prices risk social stability in poorer countries, dependent on food imports. Fears about inflation becoming entrenched are leading the world's central bankers to raise interest rates. In turn that is raising the cost of borrowing for the record debts many nations racked up during the pandemic. So all this requires some skill and cooperation among the old and new financial powerhouses of the world. But that has been another commodity in short supply in recent times. ""The economic effects of the war are spreading far and wide - like seismic waves that emanate from the epicenter of an earthquake,"" it said. In Germany, where the economy is especially closely entwined, the war is likely to lower growth by 1.7 percentage points, it said. Even in countries with little direct trade with Russia and Ukraine, households will feel the effects of the war, as central banks respond to the more rapid inflation by raising interest rates, making borrowing more expensive, the IMF said. In the US, for example, the organisation lowered its forecast for growth in 2022 by 0.3 percentage points to 3.7%, citing the prospect of more aggressive interest rate rises.  Overall, inflation pressures are significantly worse than they were when the IMF issued its previous forecast in January. It now predicts inflation in ""advanced economies"" will hit 5.7% this year, while it is likely to reach 8.7% in emerging markets.  UK inflation is expected to be 5.3% next year - the highest in the G7, and higher than all EU members, and only exceeded in the G20 by crisis-ridden Argentina, Turkey and Russia. ""Inflation has become a clear and present danger for many countries,"" Mr Gourinchas wrote in a blog. A few countries, such as oil exporters, are benefiting. The IMF expects growth in Saudi Arabia, for example, to be stronger than it did in January. But the risks are not purely economic, the IMF added.  It said the war had also created a refugee crisis and aggravated political tensions, risking a ""more permanent fragmentation of the world economy into geopolitical blocks with distinct technology standards, cross-border payment systems, and reserve currencies"".  ""Such a 'tectonic shift' would cause long-run efficiency losses, increase volatility and represent a major challenge to the rules-based framework that has governed international and economic relations for the last 75 years,"" the IMF said. A Treasury spokesperson said the IMF forecasts ""will be concerning for many people and families"" in the UK. ""However the support we provided over the past two years has put our economy in a good position to deal with these headwinds, including through record numbers of employees on payrolls and a strong economic recovery from the pandemic,"" the spokesperson said. Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said the IMF forecast ""shows the extreme challenges facing the UK economy"". ""While it is true that global forces play a role, the fact that the UK is forecast to have the slowest growth of any G7 economy next year plus the highest inflation, shows the uniquely bad situation the UK is in. ""Inflation spiralling out of control this year has created a cost of living crisis hitting families across the country, needing decisive and urgent action,"" she said, repeating Labour calls for a windfall tax on oil and gas firms. Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Christine Jardine said the UK government had ""failed to shield the UK from spiralling energy bills and soaring inflation, but they have gone ahead with raising people's taxes to their highest point in 70 years""."
geopolitical tensions,Holiday Inn hotels hit by cyber-attack,2024-09-15,2022-09-06,By Shiona McCallum,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-62814943,"Holiday Inn owner, Intercontinental Hotels Group (IHG), has confirmed the company has been hit by a cyber-attack. IHG, which has some of the world's largest hotel chains, issued a statement saying it was investigating ""unauthorised access"" to a number of its technology systems. The UK-based company said its ""booking channels and other applications"" had been disrupted since Monday. It manages the Holiday Inn, Crowne Plaza and Regent hotels.   ""IHG is working to fully restore all systems as soon as possible,"" the company said. IHG confirmed it was assessing the nature, extent and impact of the incident and had implemented its response plans, including appointing external specialists to investigate the breach. The company is also in the process of notifying regulatory authorities. In a statement, the company said: ""We will be supporting hotel owners and operators as part of our response to the ongoing service disruption. IHG's hotels are still able to operate and to take reservations directly."" But many people trying to book accommodation have been complaining. IHG did not say there had been any loss of customer data.  It also did not specifically say it was a ransomware attack, but most of the speculation points in that direction. Last month, a Holiday Inn in Istanbul was breached by LockBit, which released data stolen from the company.  It is not known if there is a connection between the attacks. The hotel chain was also the target of a three-month security breach in 2017 when more than 1,200 of its franchised hotels in the US were affected. The hack comes amid increased scrutiny on appropriate defences against cyber-attacks, particularly on Western financial institutions, in the wake of heightened geopolitical tensions following Russia's invasion of Ukraine early this year."
geopolitical tensions,Why Western nations fear India-Canada row,2024-09-15,2023-09-19,By James Landale,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66856568,"Western ministers and officials will be working hard to try to ensure the diplomatic row between Canada and India does not bleed into other international relationships.  The last thing the United States and other western powers want now is a row that divides them from India.  On the grand geopolitical chess board, India is a key player.  Not only is it a growing power - the most populous country in the world, the fifth-biggest economy. But it is also seen by the West as a potential bulwark against China.  This was apparent at the recent G20 meeting in India when Ukraine's Western allies agreed a final communique which did not condemn Russia by name for its invasion.  They chose to protect their relationship with India by avoiding a row over the statement, a choice which angered some in Kyiv. The other fear among Western diplomats will be the risk that countries start taking sides in the Canada-India dispute. Tensions between the two nations deepened considerably this week when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accused India of being behind the assassination of a Sikh activist in western Canada in June.  In recent months India has been trying to pitch itself as the leader of developing countries - sometimes called the Global South. Many of these countries have refused to condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  The US and some European countries have been making real diplomatic efforts to win over these countries, telling them the war matters to them and their economy.  Diplomats will not want this row to upset those efforts if it is somehow spun as a North v South battle between two Commonwealth countries, a confrontation between a transatlantic power and a developing nation. Canada's foreign ministry said Mr Trudeau had raised the issue with US President Joe Biden and British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. For now Canada's allies are staying loyal but cautious.  The White House said the US was ""deeply concerned"" about the allegations of the murder, saying it was ""critical that Canada's investigation proceed and the perpetrators be brought to justice"". For countries like the UK and Australia, which both have large Sikh communities, there is always the potential for a diplomatic row like this to have domestic political consequences. UK Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said Britain would ""listen very, very carefully to the serious concerns that have been raised by Canada"".  He told the BBC he had spoken to Canadian Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly about the allegations on Monday, and the UK took ""very seriously the things that Canada are saying"". He refused to say if Britain would suspend trade talks with India - but said the UK would wait until the Canadian investigation was complete before deciding what further action to take. ""Both Canada and India are close friends of the UK, they're Commonwealth partners,"" Mr Cleverly said.  A spokesperson for Australia's foreign ministry said Canberra was ""deeply concerned' by the allegations, and had ""conveyed our concerns at senior levels in India"". So for now, the West will wait and watch as the investigation progresses.  Some allies may be given access to what Canadian intelligence knows. What would change the situation is if firm proof was established.  If that happened, Western powers would have to make a choice between backing Ottawa or New Delhi, a choice between supporting the principle of the rule of law or the hard necessity of realpolitik. In the past, Western nations have condemned alleged extraterritorial assassinations carried out by countries such as Russia or Iran or Saudi Arabia.  They will not want India to join that list."
geopolitical tensions,What will it take to get inflation under control?,2024-09-15,2022-05-18,By Faisal Islam,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-61490614,"Today's astronomical rise in inflation is no less shocking, even though it was predicted.  UK inflation is simply not supposed to hit levels such as 9%, and the statisticians have had to go back in time to remodel historical data, as inflation has not been this high while the Consumer Prices Index has been in existence. As the Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey has said, these sorts of rises hit the poorest the hardest. 9% is an average across the population. The older Retail Prices Index measure is already at 11%.  But Mr Bailey's institution has a battle on now to get this under control. The really painful issue is that this rate will sustain and is on course to get higher over the course of this year.  And only this week he acknowledged that there was ""not a lot"" the Bank could do about four-fifths of the anticipated rise, as it is being imported from globally rising prices for energy and food. The question now is how quickly will inflation come down from these highs over the next two years.  Economics is a prisoner of geopolitics here. But as inflation gets to double digits, workers, consumers and companies are more likely to start factoring a big fat round number into their expectations of future price rises. Those projections reveal an uncomfortable truth. The last time inflation hit these levels, it took years, not months, to get it back down again. Only today, petrol and diesel prices hit new records, even after the impact of the chancellor's 5p cut on fuel duty.  While unions are less powerful than they were back then when it comes to wage bargaining, there are some signs around the world that given the circumstances, organised labour will assert itself.  So, numbers of this magnitude create acute social issues. The price rises are highest for goods and services that form the largest part of the spending of the poorest. Poverty will go up, hunger will go up, homelessness will go up, destitution will go up.  But when the price rises are so widespread and visible in the energy direct debits and prepayment meters of households, they also create a macroeconomic problem, draining the economy of spending power and slowing it down to a halt, or worse.  So the government will face pressure to do more, and yet an inflation rate this high creates instant multibillion pound problems that make that job harder. A-real terms pay rise for the frontline workers that everyone clapped for during the pandemic? Increasing pensions by 9% next year after the peak of the inflation? Rail fares? Student loan repayments? It would all add up.  It is notable that the UK now has the highest annual inflation of the G7 group of major economies. That could change, but right now prices in France, which capped energy bills ahead of the presidential election, are rising half as fast as they are here.  The combination of economic stagnation and high inflation is what is known as stagflation. A hopefully brief bout of it is on the way. The textbook response to it is higher interest rates from the central bank, and higher spending or lower taxes from the government.  The signs are that the Treasury is developing a further package. The overall hit to disposable income from energy price rises is the equivalent of a rise in the basic rate of income tax of several pence. An expanded Warm Homes Discount grant scheme, more repayable discounts to lower bills, or tax cuts are all on the cards.  The chancellor has said further support won't come until autumn, but when I put to him last week that he had the information he needed to act sooner, he did not really object. He set a high bar during the pandemic in terms of extending furlough support, and the scheme explains the near-half century lows in unemployment we are seeing now.  In this energy crisis his instincts have been that too much further borrowing and spending will add to the inflationary problem. It is ""whatever we can afford"" rather than ""whatever it takes"". But with dark clouds gathering beyond the energy markets, in the value of assets on the stock market, and concerns over the impact of rate rises on the property markets, the headwinds are getting stronger, bumpier and more unpredictable for households and the economy as a whole."
geopolitical tensions,Why the UK might hang up on 'high risk' Huawei,2024-09-15,2020-07-10,By Leo Kelion,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-53341080,"These are tense times for Huawei and the UK's telecoms providers. The prime minister will shortly review use of the Chinese company's equipment, with MPs set to be informed of his decision on Tuesday. It seems likely that Boris Johnson will set a deadline by which time the firm should stop being involved in the country's 5G network. But what's unclear is whether he'll also order it to be stripped out of other mobile and fixed-line broadband systems too. The decision will not only have an impact on the rollout of high-speed data services but could also encourage other countries to rethink their own relationships with Huawei. In January, the government ordered that Huawei's market share of 5G and fibre-to-the-premises (FTTP) broadband be capped at 35%, and that it also be removed from the most sensitive part of mobile networks, known as the core. Since then ministers have said that ""over time"" they want high-risk vendors - including Huawei - to be excluded outright, but have not said by when. Some of the UK's mobile networks have already spent large sums installing Huawei masts and other equipment to connect smartphones to their 5G networks. They have said they want about seven years to replace it with another option if they must, and at a push could do it in five. But some Tory MPs say the deed must be done before 2024's general election. The networks claim this would be difficult, not least because today's 5G base stations are often upgrades of existing 4G kit. So the swap to another supplier is a bigger job than it might seem as it involves replacing much of their 4G infrastructure too. In regard to broadband, BT's Openreach division will bear the brunt of any decision. It currently aims to meet the cap by using two other vendors to build new FTTP capacity rather than by replacing any existing Huawei equipment, which would involve extra cost and effort. And then there's the nuclear option.  If Mr Johnson wants Huawei out of the telecoms network altogether, then 70,000 roadside cabinets used to provide existing broadband connections would also need to be refitted.  At that point, the sums and work involved start to become colossal. Geopolitical tension between the US and China is the reason behind the review into the use of Huawei's technology. Washington claims Huawei poses a national security risk and has unfairly benefited from government support. Whether these claims are true - and Huawei denies them - the Trump administration clearly sees the company as a totem for the spread of Chinese influence, and is trying to push back. Its latest move is sanctions designed to prevent the firm from being able to get its own chips manufactured. Neither Huawei nor the third-party fabricators it relies on would be allowed to use American electronic design automation (EDA) software - which is used to design, simulate and produce the firm's processors - or any other tool based on American intellectual property, At present there is no quick way to get round this, leading one of the world's biggest chip producers - TSMC - to stop taking new orders from the Chinese company. With enough time, Huawei might convince manufacturers to run ""de-Americanised"" production lines.  But in some cases there are no easy substitutes. In particular, it would lose the ability to make chips as densely packed with transistors as is currently the case, meaning they would not work as efficiently. As a result, Huawei may have to let others design and make the chips at the heart of its products. However, UK security chiefs are concerned that this would prevent them being able to vet its equipment as thoroughly. And it is believed GCHQ's National Cyber Security Centre has told politicians the balance of risk has shifted as a consequence. One option that had been considered was for the government to advise - but not order - networks to stop using Huawei's kit. But dozens of Tory MPs have made clear they would rebel unless a tougher line is taken. Bob Seely - a member of the Huawei Interest Group of Conservative MPs - told the BBC he believes the government will announce that no new 5G Huawei kit can be installed after 2021, and all such equipment must be removed by the end of 2025. ""Not everyone would be satisfied by that,"" he said, but added that it would be enough to prevent the government losing a parliamentary vote. For now, the firm seems to be hoping it can sway the prime minister's mind at the eleventh hour. Huawei can make the case that it has built up stockpiles of its chips and the sanctions allow foundries outside the US to continue making more until mid-September. Moreover, it could promise to set aside some of that supply specifically to fulfil UK orders, and thus guarantee that it would not need to ship kit using third-party components to the country for at least two or three years  - by which point the US sanctions might be over. That might satisfy immediate security concerns, but the decision is also a political one. Huawei hopes any new restrictions are accompanied by a pledge to carry out a follow-up review, leaving the door open to a further U-turn. But in the light of tensions with China over its treatment of Hong Kong, Boris Johnson might not be in any mind to offer such a concession. Huawei could still try to mount a legal challenge. When asked about this possibility, its UK chief Victor Zhang said now was ""not the right time to make the case"" . Ericsson already supplies many of the UK networks with 5G kit and has said it can take on extra demand at a competitive price. ""Commercially, will it cost more? I can guarantee you no,"" the firm's European chief Arun Bansal told the BBC. Nokia is another existing supplier that could pick up the slack. And - in time - there's also talk of bringing Samsung and NEC on board too. But Vodafone has warned that unless operators are given at least seven years to pull Huawei out, then the further rollout of 5G will be slower than planned. Likewise, Openreach believes it would struggle to meet the prime minister's 2025 target of ""gigabit broadband for all"" if it has to replace existing Huawei broadband gear. There would also be wider ramifications. Huawei would presumably rethink promises it has made to invest in R&D in the country, including plans for a £1bn development near Cambridge. Furthermore, China's ambassador to the UK has said it would damage Britain's reputation for being a business-friendly, open nation. ""When you get rid of Huawei, it sends it a very wrong message. You punish your image as a country that can conduct independent policy,"" said Liu Xiaoming. On the flipside, a ban might encourage the Trump administration to give the UK a free trade deal that would aid its post-Brexit fortunes."
geopolitical tensions,Danish journalists are advised not to use TikTok,2024-09-15,2023-03-09,By Joe Tidy,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-64906881,"Denmark's public-service broadcaster has advised staff not to have TikTok on their work phones, because of security concerns. DR said the decision followed a security review and warnings from Denmark's Centre for Cyber Security. Journalists needing access to the app for research must now ask for permission to use what staff are calling special ""TikTok phones"". DR is the first news organisation to issue such advice. TikTok is run from Singapore but its parent company, ByteDance, is based in Beijing, leading to growing fears, in Europe and the United States, the Chinese government could compel it to spy on users or hand over their data. TikTok and ByteDance have always denied those accusations. But those denials have failed to reassure DR, which has also announced it is ending a project to use the hugely popular social-media app as a platform for its content. ""All employees are now advised against using and installing TikTok on work phones,""  executive Niels Ammitzbøll told DR staff. ""In order to ensure that you can continue to work journalistically with the media when necessary, separate mobile phones are now purchased for TikTok use.""  The BBC has not issued any advice on TikTok and is in fact expanding its use of the app as a platform for news coverage.  On Wednesday, TikTok's European arm announced detailed plans it hopes will enhance trust in its data-privacy practices. Project Clover would see data centres built in Ireland and a separate security company ""monitor data flows"", the company said. And it would make it harder to identify individual users in the data it collects. A similar plan, Project Texas, is under way in the US. But the day before Project Clover was announced, US President Joe Biden lent his administration's support to a bill - promoted by Democrat Mark Warner, who chairs the senate intelligence committee, and Republican John Thune - granting powers to ban foreign-owned technology. Since December, several high-profile organisations have announced action against TikTok: TikTok has said such bans are ""misguided and do nothing to further privacy or security"". And China firmly opposes the action. ""How unsure of itself can the world's top superpower like the US be to fear young people's favourite app like that?"" China foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said. TikTok chief executive Shou Zi Chew will appear before the US Congress later this month. On Tuesday, TikTok told BBC Radio 4's World Tonight programme it feared becoming a ""pawn"" in diplomatic tensions between the US and China. ""It would be hard to deny that we're caught up in those very broad geopolitics that really have nothing to do with us,"" its US head of public policy Michael Beckerman said. ""Almost all the major tech companies also have engineers in China,"" he said, and TikTok was not the only one to gather significant amounts of user data."
geopolitical tensions,EU leaders attempt to dodge Putin's divide and rule,2024-09-15,2022-02-08,By Katya Adler,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-60297736,"They say there's safety in numbers.  Europe, Nato and the US find themselves looking nervously over both shoulders these days.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 A) At China: the ever-present shadow over Shoulder Number One, with its economic might and expanding global influence. And increasingly: B) At Moscow, looming over Shoulder Number Two. Not ""only"" the threat to Ukraine's national sovereignty, but also concern about President Vladimir Putin trying hard to shift the balance of power in Europe. Geopolitics is very much on the mind of Western leaders. They fear the Kremlin is using tensions over Ukraine to divide and rule. It's a mark of just how seriously they view the situation, that oft-bickering allies are suddenly, and very publicly, in a determined ""we're all in this together, singing-from-the-same-hymn-sheet"" mode.  The fortunes of prominent EU leaders are also being affected, in the frenzied shuttle diplomacy we're witnessing across Europe, to Moscow and Washington, as Western powers try to calm the situation and avoid a military invasion into Ukraine. I'll get to that in a moment. Firstly, there are plenty of well-known divisions between Western allies for President Putin to try to exploit, should he so wish. President Macron infamously dismissed Nato as ""brain dead"" not that long ago. He's been the loudest EU advocate of what he calls Europe's ""strategic autonomy"". Since President Donald Trump, EU-US relations have been tense over Nato defence funding and more. EU-UK relations have been strained since Brexit. And EU member states regularly quarrel amongst themselves over all sorts of things. Very much including foreign policy. But in recent off-the-record briefings I've had with high level EU diplomats - usually good for gleaning the real low-down - I've noticed a conscious change in tone. Co-operation with the US is ""better than it has been in decades"", I'm told. EU countries are working ""extremely well with the UK within Nato"" on how to deal with Moscow, and everyone is ""100% on board"" with a plan for tough economic sanctions on Moscow and Putin allies, should Russia take military action in Ukraine. In fact, the European Commission is engaged in sustained internal diplomacy - as it was during the Brexit negotiations at the time - in an attempt to keep the 27 member states united over sanctions. It's whispered in EU corridors, that one of the reasons a precise, written ""menu"" of Russia sanctions for differing potential scenarios does not exist, is that Brussels hopes less detail means less fodder for member states to haggle over and complain about. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson commented in a UK newspaper article on Tuesday that, while the West was united in threatening sanctions, there were still ""shades of opinion"" between allies over what those penalties should be. ""We want our friends to have sanctions ready to go,"" writes the prime minister. ""We will continue to press for this."" The European Commission too has insisted that sanctions will only work if allies take a common position. Yet on Monday, that seemed a struggle for the German chancellor and US president at their joint press conference in Washington. Yes, there was lots of talk of unity. Both men publicly supported the idea of tough sanctions against Moscow if needed. But Olaf Scholz conspicuously declined to confirm a pledge heard from Joe Biden, that Germany's direct gas pipeline from Moscow would not go ahead should Russia invade Ukraine.  EU countries are often divided over Russia. Poland and other former communist countries in Eastern and Central Europe tend to want to be tough on Moscow, which they constantly view as a potential security threat. They see the UK as being of the same mind, and openly still mourn the UK's departure from the EU because of this. Italy, France and Germany have often been accused by fellow EU members as being too ""soft"" in their dealings with Moscow; too keen on schmoozing President Putin, hungry for Russian business and - especially in the case of Germany, which has all but phased out nuclear power - Russian gas. Right now, the Kremlin insists it has no plans to invade Ukraine. But the build-up of its and Russian-allied troops on the Ukrainian border, is viewed as the biggest military build-up in Europe since World War Two. Germany raised irritated eyebrows in and outside the EU recently for refusing to send weapons to Ukraine. It was mocked by many for promising Kyiv helmets, a field hospital and 350 soldiers to be sent to Lithuania. And it's hardly helped Germany's reputation that former German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, just became nominated as a board member of Gazprom, a majority Russian state-owned energy giant.  But this week, even amongst the EU's biggest Russia-critics, I was hearing that while it would be ""helpful"" for Germany to have a stronger, clearer line on Russia, Berlin was ""doing its best"" . A publicly united front to present to President Putin is clearly uppermost in EU minds. We've only just started the week, and already we've seen a whirlwind of high-level bilaterals, planned trilaterals and quadrilaterals to discuss rising tensions with Moscow. On Monday alone, the French president was with Vladimir Putin in Moscow, the German chancellor met Joe Biden in Washington and the foreign ministers of Slovakia, Austria, Germany and the Czech Republic headed together to Kyiv.  On Tuesday evening the so-called Weimar Triangle meets in Berlin. It's a loose grouping of France, Germany and Poland, designed to boost co-operation between the three countries in crisis zones. It was originally set up in 1991 to support Poland's emergence from communist rule. The three leaders meeting - Polish President Duda, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz - are clear examples of how international crises - in this case, Russia-Ukraine concerns - can affect the reputation of countries and prominent politicians. Emmanuel Macron is known (and disliked at times by some EU leaders) for seeming ever-keen to boost France's standing on the international diplomatic stage - even while he speaks of the importance of strengthening the EU's global presence. But, before heading to Moscow on Monday, Mr Macron made sure to speak to London, Washington and Brussels. EU diplomats I chatted to were approving of his attempts to try to de-escalate the situation.   France currently holds the rotating presidency of the European Union and President Macron will have been well-aware that a ""successful"" trip to Moscow would hardly harm his bid for re-election as France's president in April. Although he has yet to officially announce his candidacy. After their meeting, President Putin said the talks had been useful and substantive and that some of Mr Macron's ideas were ""realistic"" and could form the basis of further joint steps. Germany's Olaf Scholz is faring rather less well in the court of (inter)national opinion. German media headlines scream that the honeymoon period of this still relatively new chancellor is now over, because of the way he's handled the Ukraine crisis so far. Mr Scholz faces a domestic conundrum: German business and energy links with Russia are huge, and his Social Democrat Party is famously split over relations with Moscow.  Mr Scholz is also in a weak position in the German parliament. He only just squeezed into the Chancellery by the slimmest of margins. And while he and his closest adviser are known to be passionate Europhiles and transatlanticists, the German chancellor clearly felt he needed to tread carefully.  While his predecessor Angela Merkel was respected on the world stage in crisis situations, Olaf Scholz has made, at best, a hesitant impression. At worst, Germany has been depicted by some, as an unreliable ally during the crisis over Ukraine. The EU's richest and most powerful nation now defensively boasts that it is the largest single donor to help stabilise Ukraine, to the tune of approximately $2bn, since the Crimea crisis in 2014. But, in the current standoff with Russia, Chancellor Scholz heads to Moscow and Kyiv in person only next week.  And what about President Duda?  Poland currently holds the rotating chair of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, the OSCE. Back in December, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, a keen Nato member and transatlanticist, told me his country could guide and advise the West over Russia and its geopolitical intentions, as it was a country Warsaw knew very well indeed.  Poland borders Russia's exclave of Kaliningrad to the northeast, Germany to the west and fellow EU countries Slovakia and the Czech Republic to the south. It sees itself as straddling and understanding two very different worlds: east and west.  The role Poland is seen to play in the Russia-Ukraine crisis probably comes as a relief to Warsaw. It had been garnering a reputation, in quarters in and outside the EU, as a backsliding democracy, with allegations of press manipulation, not respecting the rights of minorities, or of women or guaranteeing an independent judiciary. Poland denies the accusations. For a long time now, it's been locked in a bitter battle with Brussels over what the EU calls ""the Rule of Law"" it demands all EU member states respect. That is an intra-EU tussle that will almost certainly continue, whatever transpires with Russia-Ukraine. EU-US tensions too will still simmer away over Big Tech and Nato funding, and the EU and post-Brexit UK remain pretty far from solving their differences over Northern Ireland. Despite shared concerns about the Kremlin, the longevity of the current show of unity between Western allies isn't guaranteed."
geopolitical tensions,Apple boss makes surprise China visit,2024-09-15,2023-10-17,By Chris Vallance,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-67133155,"Apple chief executive Tim Cook has made a surprise visit to China. Though in an upbeat mood as he met gamers in the city of Chengdu, the company faces flagging iPhone demand in the country, analysts suggest. It is his second trip to China this year - in March he said Apple had a ""symbiotic"" relationship with China, a key manufacturing base. But the firm's operations in the country have been complicated by Covid and US-China tensions. Mr Cook's visit included a trip to Apple's Taikoo Li store to meet young players of Tencent's Honour of Kings online battle game. ""The energy tonight was off the charts!"" he wrote on the Chinese social media platform Weibo. Honour of Kings started in Chengdu but was now ""a global phenomenon on the App Store"", he told the state-run China Daily newspaper.  He hoped that Chinese developers could repeat this success with software for Apple's new Vision Pro augmented reality headset, which would also use a Chinese manufacturer, the report said. This year marks Apple's third decade in the country.  Mr Cook, who has been CEO since 2011, is regarded as the architect of Apple's embrace of Chinese manufacturing, but the relationship has had its ups and downs in recent years.  Covid restrictions hit production in China, and geopolitical tensions with the US have added to supply chain concerns. Recently the company has sought to increase production in India.  Sales of its latest iPhone have not matched previous models, according to analysts who spoke to Bloomberg. They blamed sinking demand in China, and intensifying competition from rivals. Tough US export controls on advanced technology have made it hard for Chinese firms such as Huawei to produce models that can match the iPhone. But the launch in August of Huawei's sell-out Mate 60 Pro phone, which contained advanced Chinese-made chips, suggested rivals were catching up. Mr Cook's visit coincides with news of other Chinese tech advances. Chinese tech giant Baidu revealed on Tuesday that it had released the latest version of its Ernie AI model. Ernie 4.0 was, it claimed, a match for OpenAI's GPT-4 system At a launch event led by Baidu chief executive Robin Li, the AI was shown writing a martial arts novel and creating advertising posters and videos. China now has a number of domestically developed large language models, but AI developers face tight restrictions. And when the BBC tried out an earlier version of Ernie the bot deflected questions about sensitive subjects such as the date of the Tiananmen Square crackdown (4 June 1989), or the name of a jailed former senior Communist Party figure (Bo Xilai), with the response: ""Let's talk about something else."""
geopolitical tensions,What does Biden win mean for Brexit Britain and Europe?,2024-09-15,2020-11-09,By Katya Adler,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-54868002,"Fevered, divisive and emotional. These words accurately describe the US presidential election. But should they define the reaction of media pundits and politicians in Europe to the result? Will Joe Biden be good or bad for Brexit Britain? Might Washington now favour France and Germany? Could the UK be ""punished"" for Boris Johnson's amicable relationship with Donald Trump? These questions swirl around the UK press and social media. They are black and white questions, suggesting black and white answers. And we may have forgotten this after four years of Donald Trump in the White House and after the emotional Brexit vote in the UK - but mainstream politics are normally about shades of grey. Not acrimonious extremes. It is quite normal to work alongside former opponents or associates of opponents in the world of politics. Not long ago, Kamala Harris ran against Mr Biden to be the presidential candidate for the Democrat Party. Now she's his high-profile vice president-elect. Yes, the prime minister seemed to court President Trump and yes, Mr Biden spoke out against Brexit. But Mr Johnson and the US president-elect have many common priorities: the fight against climate change; a desire for the UN-backed Iran nuclear deal, or similar, to succeed; and for Nato to be bolstered. OK, Mr Johnson has never met Mr Biden but then, nor has Emmanuel Macron.   Perhaps we need to sit down with a cup of tea or whisky in hand, and take a deep breath. Mr Biden - with his strong reputation as a cross-party dealmaker - is a pragmatic internationalist who will likely continue (albeit in a far quieter way) his predecessor's mantra to put America first. His groaning domestic in-tray means neither a trade deal with the UK, nor repairing relations with the EU will be a top priority. When he does turn his attention to these issues, he is very, very unlikely to seek to punish the UK for Brexit or for the government's good relations with Donald Trump. Why? A lot to do with not cutting off a nose to spite a face.  Self-interest is also - contrary to the belief of some in the UK - the reason the EU is not setting out to punish the UK in post-Brexit trade talks. The EU stands to benefit economically from a decent trade deal with a stable, financially robust UK. The US values its relationship with the UK highly, in terms of security and geopolitics. Both Brussels and a Biden White House will want to work with the UK on the world stage - for example, keeping China and Russia in check and in the fight against climate change. As we've heard already from Biden allies, the new president won't put Brexit Britain ""at the back of the queue"" of trade talks, as President Barack Obama once warned. The fact is - as Mr Johnson has himself admitted - striking trade agreements with the US is tough. The Americans drive a very hard bargain. That is why there's not a whiff of that ""massive"" deal in sight, despite President Trump being a vocal cheerleader of the idea. It's now thought possible the US and UK will both eventually join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) - currently a free trade agreement between Canada and 10 other countries in the Asia-Pacific region.  As for the idea that the Biden administration will focus primarily on Paris and Berlin, rather than London, since the UK can no longer serve as a useful bridge between the US and EU, those close to the president-elect say he'll want to nurture all those relations - and those with Brussels directly too. It's not a matter of one more than the other.  There is a collective sigh of relief in the EU that this Trump era is coming gradually to a close. His administration wasn't exactly a fan of the bloc. Even loud supporters of President Trump, like Hungary's Victor Orban, seem content. Hungarians are proud Mr Biden chose beautiful Lake Balaton for his honeymoon in 1977. The Baltic states, meanwhile, are delighted Mr Biden is a strong supporter of Nato. Russia's European neighbours were ill at ease with President Trump's unpredictable attitude both towards the transatlantic security alliance and Russian President Vladmir Putin.  And Ireland, of course, is proud as proud to call the president-elect one of its own. When my US-based colleague, Nick Bryant, called out to Joe Biden to make a comment for the BBC on his apparent victory at the polls, he replied - with a grin - ""I'm Irish!"" While he said this in a light-hearted way, this does impact post-Brexit relations. Mr Biden stands with other law-makers in the US who worry about any negative impact on the Good Friday Agreement. The government insists the EU poses the greatest threat to the peace process and that it fully respects the Good Friday Agreement. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab repeated this assertion on Sunday.  But Mr Biden openly opposes the clauses in the government's Internal Market Bill, that could override the post Brexit provisions for Northern Ireland, agreed with the EU last year. Back in September he said peace on the island of Ireland must not ""become a casualty of Brexit"". According to the government, the controversial clauses in the legislation are a safety net to protect internal UK trade, but they're fiercely contested by some inside the Conservative Party too.  The House of Lords is expected to vote to remove the clauses on Monday. Downing Street must then decide whether to re-insert them - and risk real tensions with Mr Biden - when the Bill returns to the House of Commons early next month.    From Brussels' perspective, if the clauses do make a re-appearance, the European parliament has threatened to veto an EU-UK trade deal, even if one is agreed in the next couple of weeks. Interestingly, France and Germany don't envisage plain sailing with a future Biden administration either.  He already has lots of contacts in Europe from his years as Barack Obama's vice-president. EU leaders welcome his multilateralist mindset. They appreciate his calm and collegiate manner. They never got used to Donald Trump's angry outbursts and his unpredictability.  That said, they're unsure about Joe Biden's precise intentions. Foreign policy didn't get much of a look-in during the presidential campaign. Under President Trump, Germany was often in the line of fire. He obsessed about Berlin's trade surplus and railed against German military spending. He threatened punitive tariffs against German car makers. Will Mr Biden change all that?  The French economy minister commented last week that the US hadn't been a ""friendly trade partner for years"". And European military spending has been a bugbear of US presidents way before Donald Trump. A poll by Pew Research Group this September suggested only 26% of Germans and 31% of French citizens viewed the US favourably.  Another Pew survey found only 2% of Germans asked thought their country had a very good relationship with the US. Like the UK, Berlin and Paris have now grasped at climate change as dead-cert topic where there'll be close co-operation with Team Biden. He's promised that re-joining the global Paris Climate Accord will be a top priority when he gets to the White House. Emmanuel Macron and a number of other key EU figures argue that Donald Trump was a lesson for Europe. Going forward, they say, the continent should be less reliant on Washington - economically, in terms of the environment, and on security. President Macron wants the EU to create its own defence force, to work alongside Nato. But that project is fraught with political and practical difficulties. And while there is a real desire in Europe to become more self-reliant, you'd be hard pushed to find an EU leader who won't admit they're far happier when they know they can reliably count on the American president.

geopolitical tensions,What does ‘from Russia with love’ really mean?,2024-09-15,2020-04-02,By BBC News Russian,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-52137908,"Russia's latest gesture in the coronavirus crisis came in the form of medical supplies arriving in New York - part of an operation dubbed ""from Russia with love"" by the Kremlin.  In late March a similar cargo was flown to Italy - the worst-hit country in the crisis - along with 100 Russian military medics. Russian media speak of widespread gratitude for this generosity, but how much of that is fact, how much fiction? Is Russia exploiting this crisis? US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted that the US had paid for the Russian supplies, and that ""we have to work together to defeat #COVID19"". The US says the delivery was agreed in a phone conversation between President Donald Trump and President Vladimir Putin a few days ago.  The Russian foreign ministry says the US paid for half of the supplies, and the other half was donated by Russia. But Russian TV channels call the cargo ""aid"" and make no reference to payment.  A report by Gazprom Media's NTV described how excited JFK airport staff filmed the Russian plane, took selfies next to it and thanked the pilots and President Putin. New York is a coronavirus hotspot and the US death toll has risen above 5,000, according to Johns Hopkins University. Russia has imposed a lockdown similar to those in the US and Europe, to limit the spread of Covid-19 disease.  In the past 24 hours, Russia registered 771 new infections - its highest figure so far - bringing the total to 3,548 current cases and 30 deaths.  Russians have been sent home from work, but will still be paid - a measure now extended by President Putin until 30 April.  The medical aid for Italy certainly received official thanks, but there was some scepticism too about Russia's intentions. Italian newspaper La Stampa said, according to its sources, the aid had little practical value and was more like a geopolitical opportunity for Mr Putin. It went so far as to brand 80% of the delivery ""useless"". When asked about that, Russia's ambassador to the US, Anatoly Antonov, reacted angrily, saying ""groundless criticism and lack of trust for the assistance that Russia provides to Italy is cynical, immoral and cruel to those who are fighting for their lives"".  Russia's defence ministry also hit back, saying the article was fuelling anti-Russian fake news and its authors were hiding behind the ideals of free speech. Back in Russia, the media have applauded the aid to Italy with headlines like ""Thank you for extending a helping hand"" and ""USA and Europe should learn a lesson"". Cold War tensions, like those in the 1963 James Bond spy movie From Russia With Love, have clearly not gone away. Italian Defence Minister Lorenzo Guerini did thank Russia officially as did, unofficially, former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, a friend of Vladimir Putin. An Italian pop singer spoke a few words of Russian, when interviewed by Tass news agency. Another one sang a popular Russian song in a Facebook video.  But Russian state media conveyed the impression of mass support for Russia in Italy.  State channels, pro-Kremlin websites and Telegram channels talked about ordinary Italians replacing EU flags with Russian ones and singing the Russian anthem on balconies.  To prove that, however, there was just one video and one man: Federico Cane. BBC Russian spoke to Mr Cane. He is an engineer, who says he is personally fond of Russia and of President Putin.  He has done some business with Russian companies and he put up a Russian flag as personal thanks for the medical aid. Another claim in Russian state media was about widespread singing of the Russian national anthem in Italy.  Interestingly, Chinese media had earlier faked Italian balcony-singing of the Chinese anthem. An Italian media outlet debunked the video - one of many showing Italians crowding on their balconies in the lockdown.  Russian state media used two videos of a recording of the Russian anthem being played (not sung). In one instance, it was linked to Italian trade union UGL. The anthem seems to blast from a building housing the neo-fascist CasaPound organisation in Rome. The UGL trade union is historically linked to CasaPound, and the head of UGL has visited Russia several times. Another video was filmed from inside a flat, with the Russian anthem heard in the background. It was initially posted by Alena Sivkova, head of Daily Storm, a Russian news website. The video was widely used by Russian news channels and online media such as RenTV, Izvestia, TV Tsentr and Russia-1. BBC Russian found out that the video was filmed by one of the journalist's relatives, who lives in Italy and is married to an Italian. He apparently played a recording of the anthem.  Sivkova insisted that this was not a one-off occurrence and that other Italians joined in regularly in the town of Imola. There is no independent proof of that and BBC Russian was unable to get any comment from the Imola mayor's office. Ilya Shepelin runs a project called Fake News on Russia's opposition TV Rain channel. For him, the manipulation of fact and fiction in this instance is a perfect example of hybrid fake news. When fact and fiction are so tightly intertwined they can hardly be separated, he says. Yet Russian authorities themselves are now warning about fake news.  Under new emergency laws, anyone spreading false information about the coronavirus crisis in Russia can face up to five years in prison."
geopolitical tensions,Why South Korea and Japan have fallen out,2024-09-15,2019-08-22,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-49330531,"The ongoing trade and political dispute between South Korea and Japan is tied to lingering wounds dating back more than 100 years. However, as the countries are two of the world's largest economies and giants in technology, the tit-for-tat dispute also has global implications.  At the centre is South Korea's demands that Japan pay what they consider to be appropriate reparations for atrocities committed during the Japanese occupation of the Korean peninsula from 1910 to 1945, particularly the use of forced labour.  But Japan considers the issue to be settled. So what exactly is going on? The two nations share a complicated history. They have fought on and off since at least the 7th Century, and Japan has repeatedly tried to invade the peninsula since then.  In 1910, it annexed Korea, turning the territory into a colony.  By the late 1930s, Japan was starting to mobilise for war. It began to force people to work in the factories and mines, or enlist as soldiers. It also sent tens of thousands of women from across Asia - many of them Korean - into military brothels to service Japanese soldiers. The victims became known as ""comfort women"". Japan's rule of Korea ended in 1945 when it was defeated in the war. But it took another 20 years before South Korean President Park Chung-hee agreed to normalise relations with the country in exchange for hundreds of millions of dollars in loans and grants.  Tokyo argues that the 1965 treaty that restored diplomatic ties and provided more than $800m (£620m) in Japanese financial help, has settled the matter.  However, it remains far from resolved.  Yoo Euy-sang, a diplomat and author of the book Diplomatic Propriety & Our Interests With Japan, told the South China Morning Post the row was ongoing for two reasons: one, the 1965 deal did not ""settle all the problems related to our colonial past"", and two, that it ""took away citizens' individual rights to ask for reparations"". The issue of ""comfort women"" remained particularly contentious: in 2015, Japan apologised and promised to pay 1bn yen ($9.5m; £7.9m) - the amount South Korea asked for - to fund victims.  ""Japan and South Korea are now entering a new era,"" Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told reporters at the time. ""We should not drag this problem into the next generation."" But activists say they were not consulted, and rejected the deal. President Moon Jae-in, elected in 2017, suggested it be altered. The historic dispute rumbles on, with neither country looking likely to bend. The issue reared its head again in 2018, when South Korea's top court ordered a Japanese firm to compensate Koreans it used as forced labour. Mitsubishi Heavy, one of the firms involved, has reportedly refused to comply with the court order, while two other companies have had their assets seized in South Korea. The issue has angered many in South Korea, with people boycotting Japanese goods. One man smashed up his Japanese-made car.  It's also led to a flare up in tensions over a group of islands claimed by both countries.  The Japanese government, meanwhile, stuck to its line, saying all reparation issues had been settled by the 1965 treaty. Then, in August 2019, Japan announced it was going to remove Seoul's favoured trade partner status and imposed export controls on its important electronics sector - vital for South Korean companies like Samsung. Seoul then announced it had decided to end the country's intelligence-sharing pact because of the decision. It said it caused a ""grave"" change in security co-operation between the two countries. Japan's Foreign Minister Taro Kono called it a ""complete misjudgement of the current regional security environment"" and said Tokyo would ""strongly protest"" to Seoul about it. There has been no response yet from Washington, which had pushed for the pact three years ago, in part to help track North Korea's missile activity. Stock markets slipped amid fears that the trade spat could badly affect electronics around the world. However, there were perhaps signs tensions may be calming in November, when South Korea announced it had decided to continue a military intelligence-sharing pact."
geopolitical tensions,RBS warns of Brexit harm as profits double,2024-09-15,2019-02-15,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-47250174,"Royal Bank of Scotland has reported profits of £1.62bn for 2018, more than double the £752m it made a year earlier. RBS chief Ross McEwan called the results ""a good performance in the face of economic and political uncertainty"". Mr McEwan said the UK economy faced ""a heightened level of uncertainty related to ongoing Brexit negotiations"". He told the BBC that Brexit could have a bigger impact on the economy than the Bank of England has suggested.  Mr McEwan said: ""Larger corporations are pausing on their investments. And this cannot be good for the economy long-term because those large corporations then employ smaller businesses and individuals. ""If this goes on for a long period of time we're going to see the economy slowing down more than the Bank of England suggested. ""We have a very small period of time left until the end of March and it's time that our politicians got to the conclusion so that we can get some certainty going forward."" He said that 2018 saw benign economic conditions continue, with low defaults by customers on their loans.  But the bank's statement noted the potential impact of ""ongoing political uncertainties and geopolitical tensions"" which could affect its customers, and, as a result, defaults were expected to increase this year. Asked how the bank is preparing for a no deal Brexit, Mr McEwan told the BBC: ""For those businesses that are a bit concerned they may have to pre-buy a number of raw materials for their production, we've put aside £3bn for what we call a Growth Fund"". RBS said NatWest had lent or approved £1.9bn to UK businesses to deal with Brexit (out of a possible £3bn). This could be to stockpile, find new suppliers or to secure trade financing. The bank was rescued by the government in 2008 in the aftermath of the financial crisis at a cost of £45bn and it still owns 62% of the company. In October, RBS paid its first dividend to shareholders since its bailout. In its latest results, the bank announced a final dividend of 3.5p per share, and also a 7.5p special dividend, which means the Treasury is set to receive £977m. While the government is still RBS's main shareholder, it also has about 190,000 private investors. The government has been selling off blocks of shares it owns in the bank, and aims to have sold all of its stake by 2024. But it realises a loss every time it does this as it paid 502p a share and they have not yet returned to that level. RBS shares are currently trading at about 240p. Analysis: Rob Young, BBC business correspondent After RBS's near-death experience a decade ago, this looks like a very different bank. It's a lot smaller, having sold off large chunks. It also seems to have largely dealt with the financial consequences of its past bad behaviour.  RBS hasn't had to set aside more cash to pay for PPI compensation this year. The boss of RBS, Ross McEwan, says the bank is pretty much fixed.  That doesn't mean taxpayers are about to get all of their £45bn bailout cheque paid back. Despite the bank's rising profits, we'll probably still own part of it for a few more years yet. And even when we no longer have a stake in RBS, few expect the Treasury to break even.  There's also the chance that political events could knock plans to sell off the public stake. The bank is warning of the economic consequences of a no deal Brexit.  Mr McEwan says a deal needs to be done by the end of March. If not, he says the economy would take a hit. That could mean a rise in bad loans for the bank. That wouldn't be good for RBS's recovery. RBS has continued with its plan to shrink itself. Its assets, which in banking largely means its outstanding loans, shrank from £738.1bn to £694.2bn. Before the financial crisis, it was briefly the largest bank in the world by assets. The bank said the switch from physical to digital services was continuing to grow rapidly with 6.4 million customers now regularly using its mobile app, a 16% rise from 2017.  But it gave a severe assessment of the risks presented by cyberattacks. It said such attacks were increasing in frequency, sophistication, impact and severity.   Competition in the mortgage market meant profit margins remained thin, it said. Its net interest margin - the difference between what it pays for deposits and what it charges for loans, and a key measure of a bank's ability to make money - shrank to 1.98% from 2.13%. Analysis: Kevin Peachey, BBC personal finance reporter Profits may have doubled, but there is little to cheer for RBS in the latest official customer satisfaction rankings. The Royal Bank of Scotland brand was the bottom of 16 banks for overall service quality for personal customers in Britain, and 13th out of 14 for satisfaction among small business account holders. Stablemate NatWest, also part of the RBS group, was in the bottom half of both league tables.  The rankings are drawn from the views of 16,000 people (1,000 from each bank) and nearly 20,000 small businesses asked how likely they would be to recommend their personal current account provider to friends and family. Fewer than half (47%) of Royal Bank of Scotland personal current account customers said they would recommend the bank. The results are revealed by the Competition and Markets Authority every six months, with the latest published on Friday. The aim is to encourage competition between banks on customer service. Metro Bank topped the league for personal customers and Handelsbanken was ranked the best by small businesses."
geopolitical tensions,FTSE 100 dips as N Korea fears persist,2024-09-15,2017-09-04,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-41146396,"The FTSE 100 started the week with a stumble amid fears over unrest in Asia, following North Korea's test of a nuclear bomb at the weekend. The index ended Monday's trading down 27.03 points or 0.36% at 7,411.47. Mining stocks were some of the biggest risers, with Fresnillo up 2.9% and Randgold Resources gaining 2%. Analysts said the rise was driven by a rush to safe-haven stocks in the wake of the geopolitical tensions, with the price of precious metals up sharply. The underlying gold price is at its highest level in almost a year.  Traditionally precious metals such as gold and silver are seen as safe investments when there is financial or political turmoil.  Nonetheless, Connor Campbell, financial analyst at spread betting firm Spreadex, noted the FTSE had managed to stay above the 7,400 level it had reached again last week.  ""North Korea's latest nuclear naughtiness has sent another ripple of fear through the markets this Monday - as has the US threat of a 'massive military response' and South Korea's own show of (simulated) force,"" he said. ""However, with the increasing regularity of such tests, and the USA's Labor Day holiday, the edge has been taken off the European losses.""  On the currency markets, the pound was flat against the dollar at $1.2952 and also 0.42% lower against the euro at 1.0875 euros."
geopolitical tensions,Will N Korea compete in Winter Olympics?,2024-09-15,2018-01-03,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-42550446,"North and South Korea both seem keen for the North to take part in the 2018 Winter Olympic Games in the South. But there are still hurdles to overcome before North Korean skaters can take to the ice in Pyeongchang, writes North Korean leadership specialist Michael Madden. Next week, one day after Kim Jong-un's birthday, there is a very good chance that representatives of North and South Korea's unification departments will meet in the truce village in Panmunjom.  Their aim will be to discuss whether the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), the official name of North Korea, sends a delegation to the 2018 Winter Olympics, taking place in February in Pyeongchang, South Korea.  While their attendance wouldn't resolve the long-standing crisis on the Korean peninsula it would, as both sides have said, be a gesture of peace.  But before we start waiting for North Korean athletes (two figure skaters, so far) and its VIP delegation (which might include Kim Yo-jong, the younger sister and close aide of the North Korean leader) to appear in Pyeongchang, and before they even meet on 9 January, the two Koreas will need to participate in a series of careful interactions, and there's much that could yet go wrong.   The fact that South Korean President Moon Jae-in even proposed the meeting, in response to remarks Kim Jong-un made during his New Year's Day address, has sent some analysts into making overwrought and heavy handed pronouncements. They're talking about appeasement of the North, of Pyongyang using its potential participation in the Olympics as a way to extract concessions on issues of geostrategic concern, and to give voice to a ""sky is falling"" perspective that Pyongyang is attempting to drive a wedge in the South Korean-US alliance.  But it's important to note that Mr Moon's proposal and Mr Kim's remarks about the Olympics were the result of two secret meetings between South and North Korean sports officials, which took place in China in late December.   The two Koreas agreed to participate in sports exchanges during 2018.   From the North Korean side, a vice minister of athletics was sent to interact with his South Korean counterparts, who may or may not have been acting on President Moon's instructions.  Seoul and Pyongyang appeared to have leveraged this secret contact and a general agreement about sports exchanges to a potential meeting on 9 January. Based on this, and both leaders' statements, it's clear there's a high degree of enthusiasm for making this happen, and both sides are proceeding cautiously. The first step will be to have telephone conversations to plan the delegation and agenda for next week's meeting.   One hang up on this was that the North has not been answering the inter-Korea hotline when the South has dialled.   But Kim Jong-un has now ordered the reopening the North's part of the line, and the two sides have had their first direct communication in two years.   During the next few days, representatives of the two Koreas will discuss the agenda and attendees of the potential meeting to discuss the Olympics.   Even if that goes well, two things could yet prevent that 9 January meeting from taking place.   First, a DPRK representative might attempt to introduce other items that are not on the agreed agenda, slowing down the process. Secondly, if an agenda is agreed, the meeting might be thrown out because of protocol disputes. In the past, there was disagreement between the two Koreas over the appropriate ranks of counterpart officials leading to a break off in contact. The protocol issue might sound like a petty dispute to outside observers.   However, from the perspective of the North Koreans, they will want interlocutors who have the authority to make a binding decision, pending President Moon's approval, about the North's participation.   From the perspective of the South Koreans, they want DPRK counterparts who have some decision-making autonomy, and if the North makes a tentative agreement, can get the message directly to Kim Jong-un and be able to reliably advocate for it in Pyongyang's political culture (senior North Korean officials, it should be noted, have different perspectives on policy issues and debate them out amongst themselves). If there is no upstaging the agenda nor an argument about the officials participating, and the Koreas do meet, the next potential trap is that they may not be able to come to an agreement.   The North might attempt to extract some type of concession from South Korea, either a request for assistance or removing sanctions.   The South, for its part, might place restrictions on the number of cheerleaders who can attend the games, or refuse to allow additional North Korean athletes to participate.   So far, the DPRK only has two athletes who qualify for the Olympics, but President Moon has some flexibility on letting in more athletes.   Some outside analysts think that Pyongyang is using its potential participation in the Winter Olympics as a back door to undermine the international community's sanctions and diplomatic efforts intended to stop the DPRK from testing its ballistic missiles and expanding its inventory of nuclear weapons.   This is myopic and misleading.   This was, arguably, a tactic employed under late DPRK leader Kim Jong-il, but Kim Jong-un is a different leader than his father. While Kim Jong-un will certainly order continued drills of its ballistic missiles, he also wishes to see a reduction in tensions between the two Koreas and avoid any unnecessary panic about the next North Korean nuclear crisis.   Pyongyang policymakers also labour under no illusions that President Moon can prevent upcoming South Korea-US military exercises. They might ask the South to cancel the exercises, but also understand the reality that these events are planned long in advance and that Seoul does have some input as to what pieces of military equipment end up being deployed.   There is also no reason to think that once the DPRK does conduct a missile drill or even tests a nuclear device (these things, given the advanced state of the North's weapons of mass destruction programme, are a matter of when and not if) that the South Korean government won't upbraid the DPRK or even advocate for additional sanctions at the UN Security Council.   But if the North does participate in the Olympics and manages to keep its lines of communication open this reduces the likelihood of miscalculation (on both sides) which could escalate into a military conflict. President Moon Jae-in has inaccurately been labelled desperate or naive.  He has much more experience dealing with North Korea than his armchair critics.   President Moon's proposal for North Korean participation in the Winter Olympics is an incremental step that might eventually lead to further, more substantive interactions between the North and South.  For Kim Jong-un and Moon Jae-in, and to those who follow the peninsula closely, DPRK participation will be an excellent public relations opportunity, and also cause a temporary pressure drop in neighbourhood geopolitical tensions.   The 2016 selfie of North Korean and South Korean gymnasts was a viral moment that showed that athletes can put aside the political differences and provocative activities of their respective governments and compete in an atmosphere of respect and love of sport.  To those critiquing President Moon's proposal, one needs ask: do we want the Koreans competing in sports and talking to one another, or do we want them threatening to kill each other?

geopolitical tensions,EU leaders attempt to dodge Putin's divide and rule,2024-09-15,2022-02-08,By Katya Adler,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-60297736,"They say there's safety in numbers.  Europe, Nato and the US find themselves looking nervously over both shoulders these days.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 A) At China: the ever-present shadow over Shoulder Number One, with its economic might and expanding global influence. And increasingly: B) At Moscow, looming over Shoulder Number Two. Not ""only"" the threat to Ukraine's national sovereignty, but also concern about President Vladimir Putin trying hard to shift the balance of power in Europe. Geopolitics is very much on the mind of Western leaders. They fear the Kremlin is using tensions over Ukraine to divide and rule. It's a mark of just how seriously they view the situation, that oft-bickering allies are suddenly, and very publicly, in a determined ""we're all in this together, singing-from-the-same-hymn-sheet"" mode.  The fortunes of prominent EU leaders are also being affected, in the frenzied shuttle diplomacy we're witnessing across Europe, to Moscow and Washington, as Western powers try to calm the situation and avoid a military invasion into Ukraine. I'll get to that in a moment. Firstly, there are plenty of well-known divisions between Western allies for President Putin to try to exploit, should he so wish. President Macron infamously dismissed Nato as ""brain dead"" not that long ago. He's been the loudest EU advocate of what he calls Europe's ""strategic autonomy"". Since President Donald Trump, EU-US relations have been tense over Nato defence funding and more. EU-UK relations have been strained since Brexit. And EU member states regularly quarrel amongst themselves over all sorts of things. Very much including foreign policy. But in recent off-the-record briefings I've had with high level EU diplomats - usually good for gleaning the real low-down - I've noticed a conscious change in tone. Co-operation with the US is ""better than it has been in decades"", I'm told. EU countries are working ""extremely well with the UK within Nato"" on how to deal with Moscow, and everyone is ""100% on board"" with a plan for tough economic sanctions on Moscow and Putin allies, should Russia take military action in Ukraine. In fact, the European Commission is engaged in sustained internal diplomacy - as it was during the Brexit negotiations at the time - in an attempt to keep the 27 member states united over sanctions. It's whispered in EU corridors, that one of the reasons a precise, written ""menu"" of Russia sanctions for differing potential scenarios does not exist, is that Brussels hopes less detail means less fodder for member states to haggle over and complain about. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson commented in a UK newspaper article on Tuesday that, while the West was united in threatening sanctions, there were still ""shades of opinion"" between allies over what those penalties should be. ""We want our friends to have sanctions ready to go,"" writes the prime minister. ""We will continue to press for this."" The European Commission too has insisted that sanctions will only work if allies take a common position. Yet on Monday, that seemed a struggle for the German chancellor and US president at their joint press conference in Washington. Yes, there was lots of talk of unity. Both men publicly supported the idea of tough sanctions against Moscow if needed. But Olaf Scholz conspicuously declined to confirm a pledge heard from Joe Biden, that Germany's direct gas pipeline from Moscow would not go ahead should Russia invade Ukraine.  EU countries are often divided over Russia. Poland and other former communist countries in Eastern and Central Europe tend to want to be tough on Moscow, which they constantly view as a potential security threat. They see the UK as being of the same mind, and openly still mourn the UK's departure from the EU because of this. Italy, France and Germany have often been accused by fellow EU members as being too ""soft"" in their dealings with Moscow; too keen on schmoozing President Putin, hungry for Russian business and - especially in the case of Germany, which has all but phased out nuclear power - Russian gas. Right now, the Kremlin insists it has no plans to invade Ukraine. But the build-up of its and Russian-allied troops on the Ukrainian border, is viewed as the biggest military build-up in Europe since World War Two. Germany raised irritated eyebrows in and outside the EU recently for refusing to send weapons to Ukraine. It was mocked by many for promising Kyiv helmets, a field hospital and 350 soldiers to be sent to Lithuania. And it's hardly helped Germany's reputation that former German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, just became nominated as a board member of Gazprom, a majority Russian state-owned energy giant.  But this week, even amongst the EU's biggest Russia-critics, I was hearing that while it would be ""helpful"" for Germany to have a stronger, clearer line on Russia, Berlin was ""doing its best"" . A publicly united front to present to President Putin is clearly uppermost in EU minds. We've only just started the week, and already we've seen a whirlwind of high-level bilaterals, planned trilaterals and quadrilaterals to discuss rising tensions with Moscow. On Monday alone, the French president was with Vladimir Putin in Moscow, the German chancellor met Joe Biden in Washington and the foreign ministers of Slovakia, Austria, Germany and the Czech Republic headed together to Kyiv.  On Tuesday evening the so-called Weimar Triangle meets in Berlin. It's a loose grouping of France, Germany and Poland, designed to boost co-operation between the three countries in crisis zones. It was originally set up in 1991 to support Poland's emergence from communist rule. The three leaders meeting - Polish President Duda, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz - are clear examples of how international crises - in this case, Russia-Ukraine concerns - can affect the reputation of countries and prominent politicians. Emmanuel Macron is known (and disliked at times by some EU leaders) for seeming ever-keen to boost France's standing on the international diplomatic stage - even while he speaks of the importance of strengthening the EU's global presence. But, before heading to Moscow on Monday, Mr Macron made sure to speak to London, Washington and Brussels. EU diplomats I chatted to were approving of his attempts to try to de-escalate the situation.   France currently holds the rotating presidency of the European Union and President Macron will have been well-aware that a ""successful"" trip to Moscow would hardly harm his bid for re-election as France's president in April. Although he has yet to officially announce his candidacy. After their meeting, President Putin said the talks had been useful and substantive and that some of Mr Macron's ideas were ""realistic"" and could form the basis of further joint steps. Germany's Olaf Scholz is faring rather less well in the court of (inter)national opinion. German media headlines scream that the honeymoon period of this still relatively new chancellor is now over, because of the way he's handled the Ukraine crisis so far. Mr Scholz faces a domestic conundrum: German business and energy links with Russia are huge, and his Social Democrat Party is famously split over relations with Moscow.  Mr Scholz is also in a weak position in the German parliament. He only just squeezed into the Chancellery by the slimmest of margins. And while he and his closest adviser are known to be passionate Europhiles and transatlanticists, the German chancellor clearly felt he needed to tread carefully.  While his predecessor Angela Merkel was respected on the world stage in crisis situations, Olaf Scholz has made, at best, a hesitant impression. At worst, Germany has been depicted by some, as an unreliable ally during the crisis over Ukraine. The EU's richest and most powerful nation now defensively boasts that it is the largest single donor to help stabilise Ukraine, to the tune of approximately $2bn, since the Crimea crisis in 2014. But, in the current standoff with Russia, Chancellor Scholz heads to Moscow and Kyiv in person only next week.  And what about President Duda?  Poland currently holds the rotating chair of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, the OSCE. Back in December, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, a keen Nato member and transatlanticist, told me his country could guide and advise the West over Russia and its geopolitical intentions, as it was a country Warsaw knew very well indeed.  Poland borders Russia's exclave of Kaliningrad to the northeast, Germany to the west and fellow EU countries Slovakia and the Czech Republic to the south. It sees itself as straddling and understanding two very different worlds: east and west.  The role Poland is seen to play in the Russia-Ukraine crisis probably comes as a relief to Warsaw. It had been garnering a reputation, in quarters in and outside the EU, as a backsliding democracy, with allegations of press manipulation, not respecting the rights of minorities, or of women or guaranteeing an independent judiciary. Poland denies the accusations. For a long time now, it's been locked in a bitter battle with Brussels over what the EU calls ""the Rule of Law"" it demands all EU member states respect. That is an intra-EU tussle that will almost certainly continue, whatever transpires with Russia-Ukraine. EU-US tensions too will still simmer away over Big Tech and Nato funding, and the EU and post-Brexit UK remain pretty far from solving their differences over Northern Ireland. Despite shared concerns about the Kremlin, the longevity of the current show of unity between Western allies isn't guaranteed."
geopolitical tensions,Apple boss makes surprise China visit,2024-09-15,2023-10-17,By Chris Vallance,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-67133155,"Apple chief executive Tim Cook has made a surprise visit to China. Though in an upbeat mood as he met gamers in the city of Chengdu, the company faces flagging iPhone demand in the country, analysts suggest. It is his second trip to China this year - in March he said Apple had a ""symbiotic"" relationship with China, a key manufacturing base. But the firm's operations in the country have been complicated by Covid and US-China tensions. Mr Cook's visit included a trip to Apple's Taikoo Li store to meet young players of Tencent's Honour of Kings online battle game. ""The energy tonight was off the charts!"" he wrote on the Chinese social media platform Weibo. Honour of Kings started in Chengdu but was now ""a global phenomenon on the App Store"", he told the state-run China Daily newspaper.  He hoped that Chinese developers could repeat this success with software for Apple's new Vision Pro augmented reality headset, which would also use a Chinese manufacturer, the report said. This year marks Apple's third decade in the country.  Mr Cook, who has been CEO since 2011, is regarded as the architect of Apple's embrace of Chinese manufacturing, but the relationship has had its ups and downs in recent years.  Covid restrictions hit production in China, and geopolitical tensions with the US have added to supply chain concerns. Recently the company has sought to increase production in India.  Sales of its latest iPhone have not matched previous models, according to analysts who spoke to Bloomberg. They blamed sinking demand in China, and intensifying competition from rivals. Tough US export controls on advanced technology have made it hard for Chinese firms such as Huawei to produce models that can match the iPhone. But the launch in August of Huawei's sell-out Mate 60 Pro phone, which contained advanced Chinese-made chips, suggested rivals were catching up. Mr Cook's visit coincides with news of other Chinese tech advances. Chinese tech giant Baidu revealed on Tuesday that it had released the latest version of its Ernie AI model. Ernie 4.0 was, it claimed, a match for OpenAI's GPT-4 system At a launch event led by Baidu chief executive Robin Li, the AI was shown writing a martial arts novel and creating advertising posters and videos. China now has a number of domestically developed large language models, but AI developers face tight restrictions. And when the BBC tried out an earlier version of Ernie the bot deflected questions about sensitive subjects such as the date of the Tiananmen Square crackdown (4 June 1989), or the name of a jailed former senior Communist Party figure (Bo Xilai), with the response: ""Let's talk about something else."""
geopolitical tensions,US stocks slide amid market jitters,2024-09-15,2017-08-17,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-40965866,"Wall Street suffered turbulent trading on Thursday, with analysts pointing to disappointing corporate results and rising political uncertainty. The S&P 500 index recorded its worst fall in three months, dropping 1.5% to 2,430 points. All of the stocks on the Dow Jones Industrial Average - which tracks the 30 biggest listed US companies - fell as the index dropped 1.2% to 21,751. The Nasdaq index also stumbled, shedding nearly 2% to 6,222 points. Markets had been rising steadily for weeks, leading analysts to describe stocks as over-valued. Tensions over North Korea unsettled markets earlier this week.  On Thursday, the terror attack in Barcelona and speculation that one of President Trump's key economic advisers might resign further unnerved investors. ""It is uncertainty on the geopolitical front, on the domestic policy front, and as well it seems as if you have valuations that are stretched,"" said Chad Morganlander of Washington Crossing Advisors. ""So investors are looking for a reason to actually take risk off at this point in time."" Walmart was the biggest faller on the Dow Jones, dropping 1.6% after it reported lower profit margins and said it could miss forecasts for the current quarter. Other retail also suffered at the start of trading. L Brands, which owns Victoria's Secret and Henri Bendel, was one of the biggest losers, plunging more than 10% after it said sales for the year would be lower than expected. It later recovered some of those losses to finish down 5%. Macy's and Kohl's also fell more than 2%. But Gap shares climbed nearly 6% in after-hours trade, after the firm told analysts its expecting higher sales for the year than previously forecast.

geopolitical tensions,TikTok launches plans to allay China security fears,2024-09-15,2023-03-08,By Chris Vallance,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-64887704,"TikTok has launched security measures to allay concerns it could be made to share user data with China. Project Clover will see a separate security company ""monitor data flows"" - and TikTok will make it harder to identify individual users in data. ""Security gateways"" will add an extra layer of control over employee access to European user information and data transfers outside of Europe, it says. The European Commission has banned the ByteDance-owned app from staff devices. As part of its current effort to store European user data locally, TikTok revealed plans for two new data centres, costing a total of €1.2bn (£1.1bn) every year, in Dublin, in addition to one already announced, and the Hamar region of Norway. Both will be renewably powered and operated by third parties. The company has been working on Project Clover since last year.  ""We're ahead of the curve on this because we have to be - because we need to earn trust,"" TikTok vice-president of government relations and public policy in Europe Theo Bertram said. A similar plan, Project Texas, is under way in the US.  Its back against the wall, TikTok is fighting hard to prove it is no national-security threat. Executives unveiling Project Clover repeatedly said they were going further than other major social networks to protect user privacy. And I can't think of a time when a Facebook, Instagram or Snapchat held a press conference announcing sweeping privacy changes, with an open Q and A. But will it be enough to save the platform? Chinese telecoms giant Huawei bent over backwards to convince governments it could be trusted. It spent a fortune setting up a transparency centre in Oxfordshire, where for years UK cyber chiefs poured over source code looking for signs of Chinese government interference. None was found - but US-led theoretical concerns about spying still saw Huawei banned from the UK's 5G networks. Project Clover aims to convince European lawmakers TikTok is safe. But history tells us TikTok's future will remain in jeopardy unless the US is convinced - and at the moment, the US seems firmly set on taking action against the app. More than 100 million Americans use the viral-video app. But the Canadian and US governments have also restricted its use on official devices. TikTok has said such bans are ""misguided and do nothing to further privacy or security"". And China firmly opposes the action. ""How unsure of itself can the world's top superpower like the US be to fear young people's favourite app like that?"" China foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said. The day before Project Clover was announced, US President Joe Biden lent his administration's support to a bill - promoted by Democrat Mark Warner, who chairs the senate intelligence committee, and Republican John Thune - granting powers to ban foreign-owned technology. TikTok chief executive Shou Zi Chew will appear before congress later this month. On Tuesday, TikTok told BBC Radio 4's World Tonight programme it feared becoming a ""pawn"" in diplomatic tensions between the US and China. ""It would be hard to deny that we're caught up in those very broad geopolitics that really have nothing to do with us,"" its US head of public policy Michael Beckerman said. ""Almost all the major tech companies also have engineers in China,"" he said, and TikTok was not the only one to gather significant amounts of user data. ""And so some of these concerns would extend to all these companies- but that's why we're building out the system to ensure that there's no doubt that data is secure."""
geopolitical tensions,I read all those Trump tell-alls. Here's what I learned,2024-09-15,2020-09-11,By Thom Poole,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-53970246,"Hardly a day goes by without another book about the Trump White House - by a devoted former aide or a disgruntled ex-employee. Together, what do they tell us about the man?  ""Has there ever been a presidency like this?"" the author of one of the many, many books about President Donald Trump is asked. ""I assured him there had not,"" was the reply. Trump, the high-profile businessman and reality star who upset the odds to become president, was always going to be a popular literary subject.  And those books keep on coming.  This week alone saw headline-making additions to an already creaking bookcase from veteran journalist Bob Woodward and Trump's ex-lawyer Michael Cohen.  There have been blockbuster works from reporters, family tell-alls and there is a whole industry of pro-Trump books from conservative authors.  But this round-up focuses on works by those who worked with Trump either during the campaign or in the White House.  It is a long cast list: The books are by their very nature partial, and given the accounts often depend on reports of private conversations, we only have the author's word to go on that they took place. Those writing sympathetically have been painted as apologists looking for a way back in, while the critical writers have been accused of holding a grudge. But taken together, what do you get? Whatever the author's final verdict of Trump is, there is a major recurring theme.  ""Donald Trump has a fierce code of loyalty,"" writes Spicer. ""Nothing hurts him deeper than when someone he trusts is disloyal,"" says Lewandowski and Bossie. ""Loyalty was the key factor"" in appointments, Bolton says.  Cohen, in Disloyal, and Comey, in A Higher Loyalty, build their titles around this concept.  Comey's book - part memoir, part leadership study, part expose - hints at the moment Trump reportedly told him ""I need loyalty. I expect loyalty,"" when Comey was FBI director. Comey says he refused. He did not last much longer in his job. In Trump's world loyalty is the currency that decides who survives and who has the ear of the president. Sometimes, it spills into policy. In his account of the Trump administration's dealings with Venezuela, Bolton quotes Trump as saying of opposition leader Juan Guaidó: ""I want him to say he will be extremely loyal to the United States and no one else."" But for most loyalty in Trump's world is a one-way street. As Sims notes in the final chapter of his book: ""I had let my personal relationship to the president blind me to the one unfailing truth that applied to anyone with whom he didn't share a last name: we were all disposable."" A demand for loyalty is partly why several authors compare Trump to a mob boss. At least when Comey and McCabe do it they have some authority, having spent their careers in law enforcement. He got off lightly with that particular comparison. To Anonymous, Trump is like a ""12-year-old in an air traffic control tower"". Comey says his leadership is a ""forest fire"". Omarosa, whose book even by Trump memoir standards takes few prisoners, calls him ""a racist, a bigot and a misogynist"".  In his corner Trump can count on Christie, who says he was ""everything I was - but on jet fuel"". Most memorably of all, Spicer says Trump is ""a unicorn, riding a unicorn over a rainbow"".  There is a very little common ground in the books between what Trump's supporters and his detractors say about his character. To the admiring voices he is a man of charisma, sharp instinct and political skill. To them his unique speaking style - while occasionally exasperating - is a gift. Trump ""knew how to speak to the people"", says Lewandowski and Bossie.  Spicer quotes his father as saying: ""Many candidates say something like, 'I will fight for policies that will create a better economy,' while Trump says 'I'm going to get your job back."" Elsewhere, ""of all the character traits that Trump most liked to tout about himself, the boasts about his 'energy' and 'stamina' were the most undeniably true,"" Sims says, a point others make too and one which goes some way to explain why lethargy is a favourite angle of attack for Trump against his opponents. No one says that there is a radically different side to Trump when the cameras are switched off - Sims says ""there isn't really a private version"" of him.  But there are stories of him letting his guard down, such as, for once, going quiet on election night as news of his win came in (Christie). Others talk about phone calls offering condolences after the deaths of loved ones, his affection for his family or warmth for US military members. In Sanders' telling, Trump meets a soldier while on a Christmas visit to Iraq. ""A member of the US Army told him he re-joined the military because of him, and the president said: 'And I am here because of you.'"" Put it this way - it is only Spicer who talks about unicorns. Omarosa says Trump has a ""total lack of empathy, which is itself a function of extreme narcissism"". McCabe calls him the ""most prolific liar I have ever encountered"". Anonymous describes Trump as ignorant, intellectually lazy and with such a short attention span all but impossible to brief. One adviser in the book says the president's demands fall into three categories - the ""flat-out stupid"", the ""impossible to implement"" and the ""flat-out illegal"". Until we know who the author is, though, there will always be question marks over the book's contents. Less easy to dismiss is Bolton's book, who is the most senior figure yet from the Trump administration to write their memoirs. His role as national security adviser gave him a seat at the table and a say in some of the most important events in the Trump presidency.  In his book Bolton says Trump sought help from Chinese President Xi Jinping to win re-election, by urging China to buy agricultural products from farmers in key states. Later in the book Bolton says Trump ""couldn't tell the difference between his personal interests and the country's interests"". There are several examples of Trump cosying up to authoritarians: Bolton says he had a habit of giving ""personal favours to dictators he liked"", and was easily manipulated by them. He describes a letter from North Korean leader Kim Jong-un as like it had ""been written by Pavlovians who knew exactly how to touch the nerves enhancing Trump's self-esteem"" and at one summit ""not looking forward"" to leaving him alone with Russia's Vladimir Putin. To Sims ""everything was personal to Trump - everything. In international affairs, he believed his personal relationship with foreign leaders was more important than shared interests or geopolitics."" Sims sees Trump as a man of ""extraordinary talents and stunning shortcomings"".  With apologies to the authors, who use their books to also tell of motherhood, their professional achievements, or to quote the founding fathers, it is hard to resist not reducing each to one stand-out anecdote.  In Omarosa it is the moment Trump asks if he can swear-in to office using a copy of the Art of the Deal. She says ""he wanted me to believe he was kidding"". Sanders describes the moment the US president tried to help out North Korea's Kim improve his oral hygiene.  ""As the lunch was starting the president offered Kim a breath mint. 'Tic Tac?' Kim, confused, and probably concerned it was an attempt to poison him, wasn't sure how to respond. The president dramatically blew into the air to reassure Kim it was just a breath mint."" But the capo di tutti capi, the one-anecdote-to-rule-them-all, goes to Sims, who says that a small wooden box with a red button inside can often be found on the president's desk in the Oval Office.  ""If Trump noticed someone glancing at the box... he would pick it up and move it further away from himself. 'Don't worry about that,' he'd say. 'No one wants me to push that button.'"" ""Guests would laugh nervously and the conversation would continue, until several minutes later Trump would suddenly move it closer to him without actually saying anything about it. Then, later in the conversation, out of nowhere, he'd suddenly press the button. Not sure what to do, guests would look at one another with raised eyebrows. Moments later, a steward would enter the room carrying a glass filled with Diet Coke on a silver platter, and Trump would burst out laughing."" Trump is often photographed wearing his tie unusually long, with the tip dipping below his waist line. The reason, according to Christie, is that he believes it makes him looks thinner. As for that famous shock of hair, Sims says he always carried a can of hairspray in his pocket should the presidential coiffure need a touch-up. There is a tanning bed in the White House for the president's use, Omarosa says, who also alleges that an usher was fired as Trump didn't approve of her ""handling"" of it. Elsewhere we read that Trump thinks that November Rain by Guns N' Roses is the ""greatest music video of all time"" (Sanders) and was obsessed with sending a CD of Elton John's Rocket Man to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un (Bolton). Beyond briefing documents and newspapers, the president is not described as a keen book reader. Scaramucci, though, names All Quiet on the Western Front as Trump's favourite, while Lewandowski / Bossie say Swiss psychologist Carl Jung's autobiography is another one liked by the president. For those who worked for Trump but later turned on him, why did you stick with him? For Omarosa it was a matter of loyalty, even, amongst other criticisms, as she felt that as a black woman working in an administration low on diversity she offered political cover. For others there is a sense the loyalty was towards the Republican party, and an agenda, rather than the president himself. Partisanship shouldn't be underestimated. As Sanders puts it, about joining the campaign: ""It was going to be Trump or Hillary - help save the country or let it go to hell."" Bolton says he knew of the ""risks in store"", but felt he could handle it. The two were something of an odd couple - Trump vowed to stop ""endless wars"" yet appointed a man of whom he reportedly said has ""never seen a war he doesn't like"". Bolton's time in the administration saw aggressive policies against Iran, Venezuela and others. His regret is that they weren't aggressive enough.  In the grand tradition of memoirs, errors are acknowledged then the responsibility dodged. The Trump campaign and White House comes across as extraordinarily fratricidal. Most of the books, particularly from Trump staffers, include lengthy attacks on other Trump staffers. Some argue the wrong people in the wrong job explains some of the missteps, rather than the buck stopping with the president. On arriving at the White House, Bolton is warned by then chief of staff John Kelly ""this is a bad place to work, as you will find out"". Spicer and Sanders attack the press. Trump has ""never received anywhere near the appropriate credit from the mainstream media for his successes"", as Spicer says.  There's also a sense of Trump's officials holding back at key moments. Bolton at several points says he considered resigning but in his telling it took a dressing down over collapsed talks with the Taliban that was the final straw.  Both Comey and McCabe describe and regret times they did not stand up to him. Recounting a ""bizarre"" meeting, in which the president asked him who he voted for, McCabe asks himself: ""Should I have been more confrontational? .... Even when it's Donald Trump it is still President Trump. So the reflex, the automatic response I felt from the deepest part of myself, was to be respectful and responsive."" These books aren't the obvious place to find predictions of how November will pan out. Notably lots of them begin with the author being fired or resigning, so they can't claim to have the ear of the White House. You do get a hint or two though. Rallies have a central place in Trump's world, as a source of energy and an instant focus group for him to sharpen his message. That stunning win in 2016 is one he wants to repeat - and one he wants to savour. ""I'd sense the tension I believe nags Trump the most, at least subconsciously: nothing about being president has ever reached the high of becoming president,"" says Sims.  The title and theme of Lewandowski / Bossie's book, Let Trump Be Trump, allude to their portrait of a man who is not going to change, and nor should he, they say, given his success last time.  With Joe Biden still enjoying a lead in the polls, perhaps the best lesson comes from Christie, who Trump defeated on the way to victory in 2016. ""As someone who ran against him, I know this much: underestimate him at your peril."""
geopolitical tensions,Hancock before Covid Inquiry and doctors to strike,2024-09-15,2023-06-28,By BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-66038467,"A number of the papers lead with Matt Hancock's appearance before the Covid Inquiry on Tuesday. The Metro reports that the ""shamed"" former health secretary, who resigned in 2021 after being caught kissing an aide in breach of lockdown rules, told the hearing that the UK's pandemic preparations had been too concerned with the ""consequences of disaster"". He said the plans had always assumed it would not be possible to stop a virus spreading, so had focused on questions like how to procure enough body bags or find space for the dead instead of how to suppress an outbreak.

geopolitical tensions,The next US-China battleground,2024-09-15,2019-04-21,By Ana Nicolaci da Costa ,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-47848861,"A US-China trade deal - if it happens - is unlikely to end the rivalry between the two economic giants. Both sides have fought a trade war over the past year with damaging consequences for the global economy. But many say their dispute goes well beyond trade - it represents a power-struggle between two very different world views. Deal or no deal, that rivalry is only expected to broaden and become more difficult to resolve. ""We have entered into a new normal in which US-China geopolitical competition has intensified and become more explicit,"" says Michael Hirson, Asia director at consultancy firm Eurasia Group. ""The trade deal will moderate one phase of the US-China power struggle, but only temporarily and with limited effect."" The US-China rivalry is likely to play out next in the crucial technology sector, analysts say, as both sides try to establish themselves as the world's technology leader. Issues around technology transfer have been key during trade talks between the world's two largest economies in recent months. ""Every country now correctly recognises that their prosperity, their wealth, their economic security, their military security is going to be linked to keeping a technological edge,"" says Stephen Olson, research fellow at global trade advisory body Hinrich Foundation. Many say the US-China technology battle is already under way - and China's tech giant Huawei is at its very centre.  Huawei has been the focus of intense international scrutiny lately, with the US and other countries raising security concerns about its products. The US has restricted federal agencies from using Huawei products and has encouraged allies to shun them. Australia and New Zealand have both blocked the use of Huawei gear in next-generation 5G mobile networks. But Huawei has said it is independent from the Chinese government. Its founder Ren Zhengfei told the BBC in February that his company would never undertake any spying activities. The dispute reached fever pitch with the arrest of the founder's daughter in December, and more recently Huawei's lawsuit against the US government. Huawei has also gone on a public relations offensive, placing a full-page ad in the Wall Street Journal telling Americans not to ""believe everything you hear"". ""The term 'cold war' is overused in the context of overall US-China tensions, but is increasingly accurate in describing their technology competition,"" says Mr Hirson.  The dispute over Huawei is ""symptomatic of this intensified geopolitical competition,"" he adds. ""This rivalry is far more difficult to resolve than pure trade issues."" US concerns about China have grown in recent years, along with China's influence around the world. Its massive Belt and Road Initiative, the Made in China 2025 plans, and the growing importance of companies like Huawei and Alibaba have all contributed to those fears. US Vice President Mike Pence summed up the mood in a speech in October, saying China had chosen ""economic aggression"", rather than ""greater partnership"" as it opened its economy. Hopes China would embrace a more Western model has given way to a recognition that China's economy has boomed alongside a state-run system, not in spite of it. ""China has become much more explicit in its ambitions in the last few years,"" says Andrew Gilholm, director of analysis for China, at consultancy Control Risks. ""Therefore nobody is imagining that China is going to follow a Western liberal democratic model, or converge towards a market economy in the way that people hoped a few years ago.""  Some analysts think a stand-off between the two sides was inevitable.  Their different systems have always made them awkward bedfellows in the global economy, while clashes between existing and rising powers are common in history.  ""What we are dealing with here is friction between traditional free market economics, free trade economics, Washington consensus principles versus - for the first time - a huge, technologically sophisticated, centrally-managed economy that is playing the game by a different set of rules,"" says Mr Olson. As the technology race gathers pace, analysts expect the US to continue to use non-tariff measures to push back against China. Restrictions on Chinese investment into the US, limits on the ability of US firms to export technology to China, and further pressure on Chinese companies are all tools that could be used, they say. ""Non-tariff measures don't get the attention from markets that tariffs do, partly because their impact is harder to quantify, but they can have far-reaching impact,"" says Mr Hirson. More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade: A new US law passed last year could facilitate this push-back.  It strengthened the government's power to review - and potentially block - business deals involving foreign firms by expanding the type of deals that can be reviewed by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US (CFIUS). The committee vets foreign investments to see if they pose a risk to national security. Last year, even before the new law passed, a high-profile deal involving the sale of US-based money transfer firm MoneyGram to Alibaba's digital payments arm Ant Financial collapsed when the companies did not get the required approval from CFIUS.  How US-China relations develop from here will partly depend on the kind of trade deal they strike. Burdened by tit-for-tat tariffs, both sides have shown a willingness to talk since agreeing on a truce in December. But analysts say the relationship between the two giants could look different going forward irrespective of any trade deal. They could have ""an entirely cooperative, flourishing, mutually beneficial relationship"" in certain areas but put up barriers in others in what Mr Olson described as a ""selective decoupling"". An increasing number of areas could be fenced off, particularly those related to technology, he says. ""Is Huawei ever going to, in a significant way, be able to participate in the construction of the 5G network in the United States?  It seems unlikely."""
geopolitical tensions,Is Russia arming the Afghan Taliban?,2024-09-15,2018-04-01,By Dawood Azami,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-41842285,"The US accuses Russia of trying to destabilise Afghanistan by supporting the Taliban. Senior US officials have been saying for months that Moscow is even supplying the militants with weapons. Russia and the Taliban, who are historic foes, deny the charges. They come amid what some observers see as a ""new Cold War"" - so how much truth is there to the US claims? In a BBC interview in late March, the commander of US forces in Afghanistan Gen John Nicholson alleged that Russian weapons were being smuggled across the Tajik border to the Taliban. He accused Russia of exaggerating the number of Islamic State (IS) fighters in Afghanistan ""to legitimise the actions of the Taliban and provide some degree of support to the Taliban"". ""We've had weapons brought to this headquarters and given to us by Afghan leaders and [they] said, this was given by the Russians to the Taliban,"" he said. Some Afghan police and military officials told the BBC that the Russian military equipment includes night-vision goggles, medium and heavy machine guns, and small arms. US officials have accused Moscow of supporting the Taliban for more than a year. In December 2016 Gen Nicholson criticised Russia and Iran for establishing links with the Taliban and ""legitimising"" the group. Since then a number of high-ranking US officials, mainly military, have made similar claims, some suggesting Russia is also arming the Taliban. But a number of US and Nato officials have been more cautious. Testifying at a Senate hearing in May 2017, US Defense Intelligence Agency Director Lt-Gen Vincent R Stewart said: ""I have not seen real physical evidence of weapons or money being transferred."" US Defense Secretary James Mattis told the House Armed Services Committee in October 2017 that he wanted to see more evidence about the level of Russian support for the Taliban, adding that what he had seen ""doesn't make sense"". Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg is on record saying, in July 2017, ""we haven't seen any proofs, any confirmed information about that kind of support"". For its part Tajikistan has denied funnelling Russian weapons to the Taliban, calling Gen Nicholson's claim ""groundless"". The Afghan authorities have also given contradictory statements. A few provincial officials have been explicit in alleging Moscow's military support for the Taliban. But the spokesman for Afghanistan's chief executive officer (CEO) said in May 2017 that there was no evidence. Last October President Ashraf Ghani publicly taunted the Taliban for accepting Russian guns. However, his defence minister said the following month that such reports were just ""rumours"" and ""we don't have evidence"". Moscow and the Taliban deny the US claims that they are working together. They separately rejected Gen Nicholson's comments to the BBC, saying he had no evidence. The Russian embassy in Kabul and the foreign ministry in Moscow dismissed such claims as ""baseless"" and ""idle gossip"". A Taliban spokesman said they had not ""received military assistance from any country"". Moscow has repeatedly accused the US and Nato of trying to blame Russia for their ""failures"" and worsening security in Afghanistan. Russian officials and politicians have even implied that the US and Nato support IS in Afghanistan; a charge the US vehemently denies and most observers find incredible. Russia denies materially supporting the insurgents but acknowledges ""contacts"" with the Taliban. According to some Taliban sources, a communication channel between Moscow and the Taliban was established almost a decade ago, following the Taliban's removal from power by the US in 2001. But ties between Moscow and the Taliban have improved significantly over the past three years, especially since the establishment of the so-called ""IS Khorasan"" group in Afghanistan in January 2015. Taliban sources confirm their representatives have met Russian officials inside Russia and ""other"" countries several times. As part of these new ""links"", some Taliban expected sophisticated weapons from Russia that could dramatically turn the Afghan war in their favour - anti-aircraft guns and missiles that could challenge US air supremacy; similar to the surface-to-air Stinger missile the US provided to the Afghan resistance fighters during the Soviet-Afghan war in the 1980s. So far this remains wishful thinking on the part of the Taliban mainly for two reasons - such weapons could be easily traced back to the source and US-Russia relations are not that bad to justify such a drastic measure. For the Taliban, moral and political support by a major regional power is more important than the light weapons they say are widely available in Afghanistan and can be bought on the black market in the wider region. Taliban diplomatic outreach also extends to building relations with China and Iran. This is a morale-booster and has strengthened Taliban conviction in the ""legitimacy"" of their struggle to oust US-led forces from Afghanistan. The fact that Russia and Iran are accused of supporting the Taliban challenges the narrative that the militants are solely dependent on Pakistan. Softening its approach towards the Afghan Taliban is a dramatic and somehow unexpected shift for Russia. Almost all founding members of the Taliban movement were part of the mujahideen, which fought against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980s. During the factional war that followed the Soviet pullout, Russia provided financial and military support to groups opposed to the Taliban. But after the US invasion of Afghanistan following the 9/11 attacks in the US, the Taliban apparently saw an opportunity to work with Russia. Russia now no longer sees the Taliban as a pressing security threat. Instead, policymakers in Moscow view the group as a reality in Afghanistan which cannot be ignored. In March 2017, President Putin's special envoy for Afghanistan, Zamir Kabulov, even said the Taliban's demand for the withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan was ""justified"" and criticised the long-term presence of US and Nato forces in the country. There are three major reasons for Russia-Taliban links. Firstly, Russian officials say these contacts are aimed at ensuring the security of Russian citizens and political offices in Afghanistan, especially in areas where the resurgent Taliban have expanded their territorial control in recent years. At least two Russians were captured by the Afghan Taliban on two separate occasions, in 2013 and 2016, when their helicopters crashed in Taliban-controlled areas. Both were released after lengthy negotiations. Secondly, the emergence of IS in Afghanistan prompted fears in Moscow that the group may expand into Central Asia and Russia. The Afghan Taliban have been fighting against IS in Afghanistan and repeatedly assured neighbouring countries, that unlike IS, their armed struggle is limited to Afghanistan. In December 2015, the Russian president's special representative to Afghanistan, Zamir Kabulov, declared that ""the Taliban interest objectively coincides with ours"" in the fight against IS. Russia has also suggested the possibility of staging a Syrian-style intervention in Afghanistan if IS gained strength and became a ""serious threat"" to the stability of Central Asian countries on the pretext of protecting its ""backyard"". However, US officials say Moscow uses the IS presence as an excuse to justify its meddling in Afghanistan and to further grow its military influence in Central Asia. Thirdly, Russian officials insist the Afghan conflict needs a political, not a military, solution. They have grown increasingly frustrated by and suspicious of the US strategy that has not so far stabilised Afghanistan after 16 years of fighting. Moscow says the contacts are intended to encourage the Taliban to enter peace talks. A resurgent Russia under President Putin has been pushing for influence in Afghanistan, in moves seen as part of an effort to ensure a seat for Moscow at the top table in any future arrangement in the country. This comes at a time when US-Russian relations are at a low point and the geopolitical situation is changing fast. Moscow's increasingly assertive stance is linked to US-Russian tensions in other parts of the world, especially Ukraine and Syria. By establishing links with the Taliban, Moscow seems to be aiming to pressurise and even undermine the US and Nato. Meanwhile, as the rift between Washington and Islamabad grows, Russia and Pakistan are building diplomatic and military relations after decades of hostility. Moscow's reappearance in Afghan affairs is largely designed to irritate the Americans. The persistent accusations traded by the former Cold War powers has to be seen in the context of a wider blame game. Their rivalry is complicating the conflict in Afghanistan, where the number of actors is increasing. This has renewed fears of a ""new Great Game"", with Afghanistan once more a battlefield for regional and international players. A way out of the decades-long quagmire appears as far off as ever."
geopolitical tensions,Japan and China visit rival capitals in Ukraine war,2024-09-15,2023-03-21,By Shaimaa Khalil and Gareth Evans,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-65015400,"If ever you needed a demonstration of how the war in Ukraine is echoing in Asia, the schedule of the Japanese and Chinese leaders offers a prime example. Both are on strategic foreign visits on opposing sides of the conflict. Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida is in Kyiv where he is promising unwavering support to Ukraine's president, with talk of reconstruction and humanitarian aid. China's Xi Jinping, meanwhile, is in Moscow and has been described by Russia's Vladimir Putin as a friend and a partner. China may insist it is neutral, but it looks more Moscow-leaning than honest broker right now.  On Tuesday, Mr Xi said China would prioritise its ties with Russia and described the two countries as ""great neighbouring powers"". Given events in Moscow, the optics and timing of Mr Kishida's parallel trip are remarkable. So what can we read into it? It is rare for a Japanese leader to make an unannounced foreign trip and Mr Kishida is the first to visit a country in conflict since World War Two.  The visit was kept a secret until just before his arrival early on Tuesday, with officials citing security concerns. During the visit,  Mr Kishida was taken to the nearby town of Bucha, where hundreds of civilians were killed last year by Russian forces.  There, he laid a wreath, saying he felt great anger over the atrocity that had taken place in the town, and offered his condolences. Ahead of this trip, the Japanese foreign ministry said he would ""show respect to the courage and patience of the Ukrainian people who are standing up to defend their homeland... and show solidarity and unwavering support"". Mr Kishida would show his ""absolute rejection of Russia's one-sided change to the status quo by invasion and force"", the statement added. Mr Kishida has been under growing pressure to visit Ukraine from his own ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).  Until today, he was the only G7 leader not to have visited since Russia launched its invasion last year and there had been calls for him to go before he presides over a G7 summit in Hiroshima in May. He had already secured one strategic diplomatic coup by holding a summit with South Korea's president last week in Tokyo - the first time that had happened in more than a decade. Normalising ties with Seoul, sharing intelligence and showing a united front against North Korea will all reassure Japan's strategic ally, the US. The visit to Ukraine will no doubt be welcomed by Washington, too. Part of the Chinese leader's ongoing visit to Moscow is an effort to expand the country's global clout. The presence of Japan's leader in Ukraine at the same time sends a strong message on where they stand within this geopolitical turmoil.  This is no mean feat, Japan has a lot of balancing to do especially in its relationship with China. Last month, both countries held security talks here in Tokyo for the first time in four years. Beijing said it was troubled by Japan's military build-up and Tokyo criticised China's military ties to Russia and its suspected use of spy balloons.  These are the world's second and third largest economies, and an open channel of communication is key despite their current tensions.  Japan also has its own concerns about the war in Ukraine. There is a deep worry about potential parallels between the Russian invasion and a worst-case scenario of Chinese military aggression against Taiwan - which would no doubt pull Japan in.  We are not there yet and may never be, but it is quite telling where each leader chose to be on Tuesday."
geopolitical tensions,Why the UK might hang up on 'high risk' Huawei,2024-09-15,2020-07-10,By Leo Kelion,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-53341080,"These are tense times for Huawei and the UK's telecoms providers. The prime minister will shortly review use of the Chinese company's equipment, with MPs set to be informed of his decision on Tuesday. It seems likely that Boris Johnson will set a deadline by which time the firm should stop being involved in the country's 5G network. But what's unclear is whether he'll also order it to be stripped out of other mobile and fixed-line broadband systems too. The decision will not only have an impact on the rollout of high-speed data services but could also encourage other countries to rethink their own relationships with Huawei. In January, the government ordered that Huawei's market share of 5G and fibre-to-the-premises (FTTP) broadband be capped at 35%, and that it also be removed from the most sensitive part of mobile networks, known as the core. Since then ministers have said that ""over time"" they want high-risk vendors - including Huawei - to be excluded outright, but have not said by when. Some of the UK's mobile networks have already spent large sums installing Huawei masts and other equipment to connect smartphones to their 5G networks. They have said they want about seven years to replace it with another option if they must, and at a push could do it in five. But some Tory MPs say the deed must be done before 2024's general election. The networks claim this would be difficult, not least because today's 5G base stations are often upgrades of existing 4G kit. So the swap to another supplier is a bigger job than it might seem as it involves replacing much of their 4G infrastructure too. In regard to broadband, BT's Openreach division will bear the brunt of any decision. It currently aims to meet the cap by using two other vendors to build new FTTP capacity rather than by replacing any existing Huawei equipment, which would involve extra cost and effort. And then there's the nuclear option.  If Mr Johnson wants Huawei out of the telecoms network altogether, then 70,000 roadside cabinets used to provide existing broadband connections would also need to be refitted.  At that point, the sums and work involved start to become colossal. Geopolitical tension between the US and China is the reason behind the review into the use of Huawei's technology. Washington claims Huawei poses a national security risk and has unfairly benefited from government support. Whether these claims are true - and Huawei denies them - the Trump administration clearly sees the company as a totem for the spread of Chinese influence, and is trying to push back. Its latest move is sanctions designed to prevent the firm from being able to get its own chips manufactured. Neither Huawei nor the third-party fabricators it relies on would be allowed to use American electronic design automation (EDA) software - which is used to design, simulate and produce the firm's processors - or any other tool based on American intellectual property, At present there is no quick way to get round this, leading one of the world's biggest chip producers - TSMC - to stop taking new orders from the Chinese company. With enough time, Huawei might convince manufacturers to run ""de-Americanised"" production lines.  But in some cases there are no easy substitutes. In particular, it would lose the ability to make chips as densely packed with transistors as is currently the case, meaning they would not work as efficiently. As a result, Huawei may have to let others design and make the chips at the heart of its products. However, UK security chiefs are concerned that this would prevent them being able to vet its equipment as thoroughly. And it is believed GCHQ's National Cyber Security Centre has told politicians the balance of risk has shifted as a consequence. One option that had been considered was for the government to advise - but not order - networks to stop using Huawei's kit. But dozens of Tory MPs have made clear they would rebel unless a tougher line is taken. Bob Seely - a member of the Huawei Interest Group of Conservative MPs - told the BBC he believes the government will announce that no new 5G Huawei kit can be installed after 2021, and all such equipment must be removed by the end of 2025. ""Not everyone would be satisfied by that,"" he said, but added that it would be enough to prevent the government losing a parliamentary vote. For now, the firm seems to be hoping it can sway the prime minister's mind at the eleventh hour. Huawei can make the case that it has built up stockpiles of its chips and the sanctions allow foundries outside the US to continue making more until mid-September. Moreover, it could promise to set aside some of that supply specifically to fulfil UK orders, and thus guarantee that it would not need to ship kit using third-party components to the country for at least two or three years  - by which point the US sanctions might be over. That might satisfy immediate security concerns, but the decision is also a political one. Huawei hopes any new restrictions are accompanied by a pledge to carry out a follow-up review, leaving the door open to a further U-turn. But in the light of tensions with China over its treatment of Hong Kong, Boris Johnson might not be in any mind to offer such a concession. Huawei could still try to mount a legal challenge. When asked about this possibility, its UK chief Victor Zhang said now was ""not the right time to make the case"" . Ericsson already supplies many of the UK networks with 5G kit and has said it can take on extra demand at a competitive price. ""Commercially, will it cost more? I can guarantee you no,"" the firm's European chief Arun Bansal told the BBC. Nokia is another existing supplier that could pick up the slack. And - in time - there's also talk of bringing Samsung and NEC on board too. But Vodafone has warned that unless operators are given at least seven years to pull Huawei out, then the further rollout of 5G will be slower than planned. Likewise, Openreach believes it would struggle to meet the prime minister's 2025 target of ""gigabit broadband for all"" if it has to replace existing Huawei broadband gear. There would also be wider ramifications. Huawei would presumably rethink promises it has made to invest in R&D in the country, including plans for a £1bn development near Cambridge. Furthermore, China's ambassador to the UK has said it would damage Britain's reputation for being a business-friendly, open nation. ""When you get rid of Huawei, it sends it a very wrong message. You punish your image as a country that can conduct independent policy,"" said Liu Xiaoming. On the flipside, a ban might encourage the Trump administration to give the UK a free trade deal that would aid its post-Brexit fortunes."
geopolitical tensions,Millionaires at Davos say 'tax us more',2024-09-15,2022-05-23,By Lucy Hooker,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-61549155,"A handful of wealthy attendees gathered in Davos are calling on world leaders to tackle the cost of living crisis by pushing up taxes for people like them. They took to the streets on Sunday alongside left-wing activists to call for fairer tax systems worldwide. Political and business leaders are at the first in-person World Economic Forum (WEF) since the pandemic began. But criticisms are mounting over the way the wealthy have profited in the last two years. UK millionaire Phil White said: ""While the rest of the world is collapsing under the weight of an economic crisis, billionaires and world leaders meet in this private compound to discuss turning points in history. ""It's outrageous that our political leaders listen to those who have the most, know the least about the economic impact of this crisis, and many of whom pay infamously little in taxes. The only credible outcome from this conference is to tax the richest and tax us now."" Mr White, who represents a group called Patriotic Millionaires, made his money as a business consultant. He said he was joining left-wing and anti-poverty campaigners calling for change at the annual meeting of influential business people and political leaders because the current economic system was failing. Over the past decade, a growing number of millionaires and billionaires in the US and Europe have spoken out, calling for governments to impose higher taxes, including wealth levies on the richest. While only a small number of millionaires were in Davos to attend the protest, the campaigners have sent an open letter to all Davos delegates, signed by more than 150 millionaires in several countries. New signatories to the letter, which was initially sent in January, include the American actor Mark Ruffalo. Among the earlier supporters of the movement are  Disney heiress Abigail Disney, Nick Hanauer, a US entrepreneur and early investor in online giant Amazon, and Morris Pearl, a former managing director at investment firm BlackRock.  Marlene Engelhorn, another millionaire at the protest, said: ""As someone who has enjoyed the benefits of wealth my whole life, I know how skewed our economy is and I cannot continue to sit back and wait for someone, somewhere, to do something.  ""We have hit the end of the line when another quarter of a billion people will be pushed into extreme poverty this year."" The charity Oxfam, which issues a report on inequality during the Davos forum each year, claims that over the last two years a new billionaire had been created every 30 hours. At the other end of the income spectrum, Oxfam expects around one million people to fall into extreme poverty every 33 hours this year, the charity's international executive director Gabriela Bucher told the BBC. ""Inequality between countries had been reducing over the last couple of decades,"" she said. ""During the pandemic it had increased and with the rates we're seeing now it looks like it's going in extreme directions that are creating these catastrophic conditions and they reflect in people's lives."" Energy prices began to rise towards the end of last year, but grew more steeply following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Prices for food and other goods are also sharply higher.  Geopolitical tensions are making it harder resolve tensions over trade, and growth has slowed in much of the world. The world's richer countries collectively grew by just 0.1% in the first three months of this year, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, with the US, Italy and Japan shrinking in the quarter, and France experiencing zero growth. The UK's economy grew by 0.8%. Ahead of the WEF meeting, the head of the International Monetary Fund, Kristalina Georgieva, said the global economy was facing a ""confluence of calamities"" with trade fragmenting. This WEF meeting is taking place later in the year than usual, meaning the 2,000 leaders, experts and business people attending will not be able to enjoy skiing in their spare time in the Swiss resort. Topics on the agenda include the war in Ukraine, pandemic recovery and climate change."
geopolitical tensions,What's behind Trump's new strategy on China?,2024-09-15,2020-05-01,By Barbara Plett Usher,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52506073,"Tensions between the US and China are longstanding but the pandemic and a looming presidential election have amplified the rivalry, and this week the war of words hit a new peak. What's the US strategy?  This week President Donald J Trump turned a corner with his 2020 re-election campaign. ""China will do anything they can to have me lose this race,"" he told the Reuters news agency.  His sharpening rhetoric against Beijing marked a new phase in an effort to reframe an election that's been reshaped by the coronavirus pandemic.  And it signalled rockier times for the already rocky relationship between the world's two biggest economies.  The Trump campaign had planned to make America's booming economy its centrepiece, but that has tanked. And polls show decreasing support for the president in key battleground states amidst criticism of his corona crisis performance. Enter China, the origin of the pandemic and accused of acting too slowly to stop its global spread. The Republican strategy actually attacks the former vice president, Joe Biden, the presumed Democratic nominee.  Mr Trump's allies in the America First Action (AFA) political committee have been rolling out advertisements lashing ""Beijing Biden"" for ""leading the charge"" of a Washington elite too willing to accommodate a predatory China.  Mr Biden has hit back with an advert that accuses the president of trying to deflect blame for his own slow response to the pandemic, and of being too trusting of China's initial information about the virus. The common element in these starkly different positions is that both campaigns believe it's good politics to argue their man will be strongest in taking on Beijing. ""If you look at the most recent Pew poll and Gallup poll, Americans' distrust of China, whether you're Republican or Democrat, is at an all-time high,"" roughly two-thirds of the country, says the AFA's Kelly Sadler. ""This is a universal issue that Republicans and Democrats can both agree on."" There's certainly been a dramatic uptick in negative views of China since Mr Trump took office and dialled up the trade war.  When it comes to Beijing's culpability for the corona crisis, however, he has regularly wavered, at times lavishing praise on President Xi Jinping, at times lashing the ""Chinese Virus."" But he's now started to adopt the hardline campaign-speak, vowing to make China pay for the damage.  The aggressive rhetoric builds on a growing fury in the administration and amongst multiple lawmakers at the Chinese government's lack of transparency about a virus that has brought global disaster.  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has been out front on this. He regularly declares that the Chinese communist party can't be trusted. He focuses attention on Beijing's inability to contain the virus shortly after it emerged, and questions the security of its laboratories, all charges that China vigorously denies.  There are concerns about China's behaviour across the political spectrum, says Michael Green, who was an Asia advisor for President George W Bush. But members of Mr Trump's national security team have ""a very zero sum view of relations with China and are particularly focused on preventing China from getting any advantage out of any situation.""  President Xi Jinping's playbook is also ""much more aggressive"" than his predecessors,"" says Mr Green, noting a robust Chinese propaganda campaign that's even suggested the virus came from the US military. ""There's a zero sum ideological and geopolitical spin on the ball coming out of China that predates Donald Trump.""  But that nationalist authoritarian turn has clashed with the Trump administration's America First nationalism, increasing confrontation and preventing the kind of cooperation that could combat the pandemic and prevent a new one. Mr Green notes that before President Trump took office there were more than two dozen American and Chinese staff experts from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ""working these issues"" in Beijing. When the crisis broke out there were three or four, although he says both governments are to blame for that. The national security experts are countered by the ""New York globalists"" in Mr Trump's inner circle, who argue that the United States needs China for business and trade.  ""The relationship between China and the United States is going to be very uneven going forward,"" says Gary Locke, a Chinese American who was President Barack Obama's ambassador to Beijing. ""It will be antagonistic at one level, but also seeking great cooperation on…the economic front, because so many American farmers depend on China (to buy) what they produce.""  As the election approaches Mr Trump has signalled that he will listen more to the hawks than the doves in his coterie of conflicted advisors. And he'll be cheered on by a number of Republican lawmakers who've been pushing the administration to stand up to China. Several have introduced legislation or floated ideas that would punish Beijing for concealing or distorting information about the coronavirus. The states of Missouri and Mississippi have taken the unprecedented step of suing for damages.  And the party's fiercest China critic, Senator Tom Cotton, has gone to the extreme of accusing the Chinese government of deliberately allowing the virus to escape it's borders, ""because if they were going to suffer an economic contraction they were not going to allow the world to continue to prosper.""  But his call to bring supply lines back to the United States will have bipartisan resonance as the pandemic has focused glaring attention on America's dependence on China for drugs and medical equipment. Crucially, there's concern that the anti-China rhetoric is reinforcing an atmosphere of xenophobia already growing because of the pandemic, resulting in an increase of verbal and physical attacks on Asian Americans.  ""Just because I'm Chinese American doesn't mean that I'm a Chinese government official,"" Gary Locke noted wryly of his unexpected appearance in the Trump campaign's advert bashing Joe Biden. Mr Biden's team has also been criticised on the left for ""out-Trumping Trump"" rather than challenging a ""racist nationalistic"" conversation.  Both campaigns have denied stoking xenophobia. But China's been placed squarely in the middle of an election at a time when voters are angry and afraid for their livelihoods. By November they could be angrier and poorer. Their ballots will show who they blame.  "
geopolitical tensions,US urges China not to 'play spoiler' at G20,2024-09-15,2023-09-06,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-66725790,"US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan has asked China to set aside its issues with India and play a ""constructive role"" in the upcoming G20 summit. Mr Sullivan said it was up to China if it ""wanted to play the role of a spoiler"" instead. His remarks come after China confirmed that its leader, Xi Jinping, would not attend the meeting.  India will host the summit in the capital Delhi on 9 and 10 September. Neither India nor China has given specific reasons behind Mr Xi's absence. China has said Premier Li Qiang will lead its delegation at the summit instead. India and China have a frosty relationship and tensions between the two countries have worsened since 2020, when their troops were involved in a deadly clash at the Galwan valley in Ladakh. The source of the tension between the neighbours is a disputed 3,440km (2,100 mile)-long de facto border along the Himalayas - which is poorly demarcated and soldiers on either side come face to face at many points. Last week, the two countries got into a diplomatic row over an ""official map"" released by China, which India said laid claim to its territory. Beijing responded by saying that Delhi should refrain from ""over-interpreting"" the issue. Asked by a reporter at a press briefing if tensions between India and China would overshadow the summit, Mr Sullivan said that that was ""up to China"".  ""If China wants to come in and play the role of spoiler, of course, that option is available to them,"" he said. But he added that the summit's chair - India - the US and ""every other member"" of the G20 would encourage China to ""come in in a constructive way on climate, on multilateral development bank reform, on debt relief, on technology, and set aside the geopolitical questions and really focus on problem-solving and delivering for the developing countries"". The G20 - or Group of Twenty - is a club of countries which meets to discuss plans for the global economy. Between them, G20 countries account for 85% of the world's economic output and 75% of world trade. They contain two-thirds of the global population. BBC News India is now on YouTube.

geopolitical tensions,Danish journalists are advised not to use TikTok,2024-09-15,2023-03-09,By Joe Tidy,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-64906881,"Denmark's public-service broadcaster has advised staff not to have TikTok on their work phones, because of security concerns. DR said the decision followed a security review and warnings from Denmark's Centre for Cyber Security. Journalists needing access to the app for research must now ask for permission to use what staff are calling special ""TikTok phones"". DR is the first news organisation to issue such advice. TikTok is run from Singapore but its parent company, ByteDance, is based in Beijing, leading to growing fears, in Europe and the United States, the Chinese government could compel it to spy on users or hand over their data. TikTok and ByteDance have always denied those accusations. But those denials have failed to reassure DR, which has also announced it is ending a project to use the hugely popular social-media app as a platform for its content. ""All employees are now advised against using and installing TikTok on work phones,""  executive Niels Ammitzbøll told DR staff. ""In order to ensure that you can continue to work journalistically with the media when necessary, separate mobile phones are now purchased for TikTok use.""  The BBC has not issued any advice on TikTok and is in fact expanding its use of the app as a platform for news coverage.  On Wednesday, TikTok's European arm announced detailed plans it hopes will enhance trust in its data-privacy practices. Project Clover would see data centres built in Ireland and a separate security company ""monitor data flows"", the company said. And it would make it harder to identify individual users in the data it collects. A similar plan, Project Texas, is under way in the US. But the day before Project Clover was announced, US President Joe Biden lent his administration's support to a bill - promoted by Democrat Mark Warner, who chairs the senate intelligence committee, and Republican John Thune - granting powers to ban foreign-owned technology. Since December, several high-profile organisations have announced action against TikTok: TikTok has said such bans are ""misguided and do nothing to further privacy or security"". And China firmly opposes the action. ""How unsure of itself can the world's top superpower like the US be to fear young people's favourite app like that?"" China foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said. TikTok chief executive Shou Zi Chew will appear before the US Congress later this month. On Tuesday, TikTok told BBC Radio 4's World Tonight programme it feared becoming a ""pawn"" in diplomatic tensions between the US and China. ""It would be hard to deny that we're caught up in those very broad geopolitics that really have nothing to do with us,"" its US head of public policy Michael Beckerman said. ""Almost all the major tech companies also have engineers in China,"" he said, and TikTok was not the only one to gather significant amounts of user data."
geopolitical tensions,China 'using sheer size' in sea row,2024-09-15,2015-04-09,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-32234448,"Aerial view of artificial islands on Mischief Reef (photo: CSIS's Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative/DigitalGlobe) The US is concerned China is using ""sheer size and muscle"" to strong-arm smaller nations in the row over the South China Sea, Barack Obama says. The US president's comments came amid heightened focus on Beijing's construction of artificial islands in disputed areas of the sea. On Thursday a US think tank released images showing land reclamation work on a reef claimed by the Philippines.  China says the work is needed to safeguard its sovereignty. China claims almost the whole of the South China Sea, resulting in overlapping claims with several other Asian nations including Vietnam and the Philippines.  They say China is illegally reclaiming land in contested areas to create artificial islands with facilities that could potentially be for military use.  Images have emerged of work in multiple areas in the Spratly islands, which several nations claim.  The most recent images, from the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, showed work on Mischief reef.  The think tank published before-and-after satellite pictures, external showing man-made islands with runways and harbours, and Chinese vessels dredging sand on to the reef.  Asked about the issue during a visit to Jamaica, Mr Obama said the views of smaller claimant nations had to be considered.  ""Where we get concerned with China is where it is not necessarily abiding by international norms and rules, and is using its sheer size and muscle to force countries into subordinate positions,"" he said.  ""We think this can be solved diplomatically, but just because the Philippines or Vietnam are not as large as China doesn't mean that they can just be elbowed aside.""  Ships and construction on Mischief Reef (photo: CSIS's Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative/DigitalGlobe) Photo: CSIS's Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative/DigitalGlobe Photo: CSIS's Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative/DigitalGlobe Hours earlier, China gave one of its most detailed comments on the issue at a foreign ministry daily press briefing. Spokeswoman Hua Chunying said, external (transcript in Chinese) that China had ""indisputable rights"" to the Spratly islands, and that it was only ""protecting the country's national sovereignty and maritime rights"". The construction was to serve troops protecting the area and civilian activity such as search and rescue operations, scientific research and commercial fishing, she said. ""The structures... do not affect, nor are they targeted at, any particular country,"" she said, adding that China would ""continue to strengthen"" its activities in the area. Manila released this photo in May appearing to show Chinese land reclamation at Johnson South reef Rupert Wingfield-Hayes: China's Island Factory I stare out at the endless rolling waves. On the horizon the sky is dark and threatening. Then my eye is caught by something sticking up above the waves. It looks like an oil or gas-drilling platform. What on earth is it doing here? As we get closer, to my right, I am sure I can now see something pale and sandy beside the platform. ""That looks like land!"" I say. It can't be. I look at my GPS. There is no land marked anywhere near here, only a submerged reef of the Spratly Island chain. But my eyes are not deceiving me. A few kilometres away I can now clearly see the outline of an island. In recent days, several senior US officials have weighed in on China's land reclamation work, warning it raises regional tensions. The commander of the US Pacific fleet, Adm Harry Harris, said in a speech in Australia last week that China was ""creating a great wall of sand with dredges and bulldozers"". He said that work to date had created more than 4 sq km (1.5 sq miles) of artificial land mass. US Navy Lt Cmdr Wilson VornDick wrote in an analysis, external on the CSIS website: ""It appears that China's building projects are part of an expansive territorial grab or to make China's disputed Nine-Dash Line claim a reality.""  The Nine-Dash line is a boundary which China uses to demarcate its claims in the South China Sea. It is not recognised outside China. The row has already led to conflict. When China placed an oil rig in waters claimed by Vietnam last year, anti-China riots erupted.  The Philippines has filed a complaint with UN's Permanent Court of Arbitration - but China says it will not engage with the case.

geopolitical tensions,What does Biden win mean for Brexit Britain and Europe?,2024-09-15,2020-11-09,By Katya Adler,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-54868002,"Fevered, divisive and emotional. These words accurately describe the US presidential election. But should they define the reaction of media pundits and politicians in Europe to the result? Will Joe Biden be good or bad for Brexit Britain? Might Washington now favour France and Germany? Could the UK be ""punished"" for Boris Johnson's amicable relationship with Donald Trump? These questions swirl around the UK press and social media. They are black and white questions, suggesting black and white answers. And we may have forgotten this after four years of Donald Trump in the White House and after the emotional Brexit vote in the UK - but mainstream politics are normally about shades of grey. Not acrimonious extremes. It is quite normal to work alongside former opponents or associates of opponents in the world of politics. Not long ago, Kamala Harris ran against Mr Biden to be the presidential candidate for the Democrat Party. Now she's his high-profile vice president-elect. Yes, the prime minister seemed to court President Trump and yes, Mr Biden spoke out against Brexit. But Mr Johnson and the US president-elect have many common priorities: the fight against climate change; a desire for the UN-backed Iran nuclear deal, or similar, to succeed; and for Nato to be bolstered. OK, Mr Johnson has never met Mr Biden but then, nor has Emmanuel Macron.   Perhaps we need to sit down with a cup of tea or whisky in hand, and take a deep breath. Mr Biden - with his strong reputation as a cross-party dealmaker - is a pragmatic internationalist who will likely continue (albeit in a far quieter way) his predecessor's mantra to put America first. His groaning domestic in-tray means neither a trade deal with the UK, nor repairing relations with the EU will be a top priority. When he does turn his attention to these issues, he is very, very unlikely to seek to punish the UK for Brexit or for the government's good relations with Donald Trump. Why? A lot to do with not cutting off a nose to spite a face.  Self-interest is also - contrary to the belief of some in the UK - the reason the EU is not setting out to punish the UK in post-Brexit trade talks. The EU stands to benefit economically from a decent trade deal with a stable, financially robust UK. The US values its relationship with the UK highly, in terms of security and geopolitics. Both Brussels and a Biden White House will want to work with the UK on the world stage - for example, keeping China and Russia in check and in the fight against climate change. As we've heard already from Biden allies, the new president won't put Brexit Britain ""at the back of the queue"" of trade talks, as President Barack Obama once warned. The fact is - as Mr Johnson has himself admitted - striking trade agreements with the US is tough. The Americans drive a very hard bargain. That is why there's not a whiff of that ""massive"" deal in sight, despite President Trump being a vocal cheerleader of the idea. It's now thought possible the US and UK will both eventually join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) - currently a free trade agreement between Canada and 10 other countries in the Asia-Pacific region.  As for the idea that the Biden administration will focus primarily on Paris and Berlin, rather than London, since the UK can no longer serve as a useful bridge between the US and EU, those close to the president-elect say he'll want to nurture all those relations - and those with Brussels directly too. It's not a matter of one more than the other.  There is a collective sigh of relief in the EU that this Trump era is coming gradually to a close. His administration wasn't exactly a fan of the bloc. Even loud supporters of President Trump, like Hungary's Victor Orban, seem content. Hungarians are proud Mr Biden chose beautiful Lake Balaton for his honeymoon in 1977. The Baltic states, meanwhile, are delighted Mr Biden is a strong supporter of Nato. Russia's European neighbours were ill at ease with President Trump's unpredictable attitude both towards the transatlantic security alliance and Russian President Vladmir Putin.  And Ireland, of course, is proud as proud to call the president-elect one of its own. When my US-based colleague, Nick Bryant, called out to Joe Biden to make a comment for the BBC on his apparent victory at the polls, he replied - with a grin - ""I'm Irish!"" While he said this in a light-hearted way, this does impact post-Brexit relations. Mr Biden stands with other law-makers in the US who worry about any negative impact on the Good Friday Agreement. The government insists the EU poses the greatest threat to the peace process and that it fully respects the Good Friday Agreement. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab repeated this assertion on Sunday.  But Mr Biden openly opposes the clauses in the government's Internal Market Bill, that could override the post Brexit provisions for Northern Ireland, agreed with the EU last year. Back in September he said peace on the island of Ireland must not ""become a casualty of Brexit"". According to the government, the controversial clauses in the legislation are a safety net to protect internal UK trade, but they're fiercely contested by some inside the Conservative Party too.  The House of Lords is expected to vote to remove the clauses on Monday. Downing Street must then decide whether to re-insert them - and risk real tensions with Mr Biden - when the Bill returns to the House of Commons early next month.    From Brussels' perspective, if the clauses do make a re-appearance, the European parliament has threatened to veto an EU-UK trade deal, even if one is agreed in the next couple of weeks. Interestingly, France and Germany don't envisage plain sailing with a future Biden administration either.  He already has lots of contacts in Europe from his years as Barack Obama's vice-president. EU leaders welcome his multilateralist mindset. They appreciate his calm and collegiate manner. They never got used to Donald Trump's angry outbursts and his unpredictability.  That said, they're unsure about Joe Biden's precise intentions. Foreign policy didn't get much of a look-in during the presidential campaign. Under President Trump, Germany was often in the line of fire. He obsessed about Berlin's trade surplus and railed against German military spending. He threatened punitive tariffs against German car makers. Will Mr Biden change all that?  The French economy minister commented last week that the US hadn't been a ""friendly trade partner for years"". And European military spending has been a bugbear of US presidents way before Donald Trump. A poll by Pew Research Group this September suggested only 26% of Germans and 31% of French citizens viewed the US favourably.  Another Pew survey found only 2% of Germans asked thought their country had a very good relationship with the US. Like the UK, Berlin and Paris have now grasped at climate change as dead-cert topic where there'll be close co-operation with Team Biden. He's promised that re-joining the global Paris Climate Accord will be a top priority when he gets to the White House. Emmanuel Macron and a number of other key EU figures argue that Donald Trump was a lesson for Europe. Going forward, they say, the continent should be less reliant on Washington - economically, in terms of the environment, and on security. President Macron wants the EU to create its own defence force, to work alongside Nato. But that project is fraught with political and practical difficulties. And while there is a real desire in Europe to become more self-reliant, you'd be hard pushed to find an EU leader who won't admit they're far happier when they know they can reliably count on the American president.

geopolitical tensions,New images show Doklam plateau build-up,2024-09-15,2018-01-26,By Jonathan Marcus,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-42834609,"This is an area of interim borders and unsettled claims. While tensions have calmed since the last stand-off on the Doklam plateau, along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) which ended in August of last year, both sides are continuing to build up their ground forces in this inhospitable terrain.  The plateau, which lies at a junction between China, the north-eastern Indian state of Sikkim and the Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan, is currently disputed between Beijing and Bhutan. India supports Bhutan's claim over it.  US geopolitical intelligence company Stratfor's images focus on the accompanying build-up in air power to support these units. The Stratfor analysis looks at four critical air bases, two Chinese and two Indian, that are within range of the Doklam plateau.  They say ""the  imagery confirms that both China and India are pursuing a wide-ranging strategic build-up that has only accelerated in the wake of the 27 August agreement"".  On the Indian side of the border, imagery of the Siliguri Bagdogra air base and the Hasimara air force station shows how India has moved to reinforce its air power close to the Doklam plateau.  Siliguri Bagdogra normally hosts a transport helicopter unit while Hasimara was the base for MiG-27ML ground attack aircraft until they were retired at the end of 2017.  Since the Doklam crisis of mid-2017, however, the Indian air force has greatly increased the deployment of Su-30MKI warplanes to these air bases as can be seen from the imagery.  The Su-30MKI is India's premier fighter jet, and it will soon be capable of striking land targets with the advanced BrahMos cruise missile.  On the Chinese Side, Stratfor says ""an even greater level of activity is visible from imagery of the Chinese air bases near Lhasa and Shigatse.  ""This expansion may indicate a greater build-up by the Chinese,"" but Stratfor notes that ""it could also reflect the more advanced facilities at these bases. Furthermore, unlike India, China's lack of air bases close to the LAC forces it to concentrate more of its air power at these airports"".  Imagery of the two air bases shows a significant presence of fighter aircraft (which Stratfor says peaked in October) and a notable increase in helicopters, as well as deployments of KJ-500 airborne early warning and command aircraft, components of the HQ-9 long-range surface-to-air missile system and Soar Dragon unmanned aerial vehicles at Shigatse Peace Airport.  The Chinese made a number of major airfield upgrades at Shigatse immediately after the end of the crisis. A new runaway was constructed by mid-December, as well as other infrastructure improvements. India and China have a long history of border tensions. India was defeated in a border war with China in 1962. There were armed clashes in 1967 and a prolonged stand-off during 1986 and 1987. Clearly the unresolved border issues are the immediate cause of these tensions.  But other factors need to be looked at too, including the influence of nationalism in both countries as a mobilising force and the wider strategic competition between India and China as they both modernise and enhance their armed forces. So future conflict could erupt from an episode on the disputed border, but equally it could reflect the wider geo-strategic competition between these two aspiring powers.  The Stratfor analysis concludes: ""It is only a question of time until a new flashpoint along the LAC emerges, and as the increased activity shows, both sides will have greater capabilities to bring to bear"" in any future crisis.

geopolitical tensions,US chip makers hit by new China export rule,2024-09-15,2022-09-01,By Annabelle  Liang,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-62747401,"Shares of major chipmakers Nvidia and AMD have fallen amid concerns of new US restrictions on the sale of artificial intelligence chips to China. Nvidia says the US government requires a new licence, effective immediately, to address the risk of chips being ""used in, or diverted to a 'military end use'... in China and Russia"". There are fears the rule could lead to millions of dollars in lost revenue.  Shares of both chipmakers slipped in after-hours trading in New York.  Nvidia's shares were down by 6.6% while AMD slipped 3.7%. The new restrictions are a ""gut punch for Nvidia"", Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities told the BBC. Chinese officials have firmly opposed the latest move. According to state media, ""actions from the United States deviated from the principle of fair competition and violated international economic and trade rules"".  In a statement, Beijing said ""The US side should immediately stop its wrongdoing, treat companies from all over the world including Chinese companies fairly, and do more things that are conducive to the stability of the world economy.""  The US Commerce Department told the BBC it was ""not in a position to outline specific policy changes at this time"". ""We are taking a comprehensive approach to implement additional actions necessary related to technologies, end-uses, and end-users to protect US national security and foreign policy interests,"" a Commerce Department spokesperson said. ""This includes preventing China's acquisition and use of US technology in the context of its military-civil fusion program to fuel its military modernisation efforts, conduct human rights abuses, and enable other malign activities."" In a US regulatory filing on Wednesday, Nvidia said the new licence requirement would hit exports of its A100 and H100 chips, which are designed to speed up machine learning tasks, and the systems which include them. Around $400m (£345.2m) in sales to China could be affected, Nvidia added, ""if customers do not want to purchase the company's alternative product offerings or if the (US government) does not grant licenses in a timely manner or denies licenses to significant customers"". A Nvidia spokesperson told BBC it was liaising with customers in China ""to satisfy their planned or future purchases with alternative products"". Meanwhile, an AMD spokesperson said the rules, which would prevent the shipment of its MI250 chips to China, were not expected to have ""a material impact"" on business. Both Nvidia and AMD halted sales to Russia after the invasion of Ukraine in February. Analysts said the US requirements could make it more difficult for China to acquire chips for advanced computing. It could also affect the earnings of US manufacturers such as Nvidia and AMD, said Mario Morales, a California-based analyst at market intelligence firm IDC. ""Both companies have a large exposure to China and could see more impact going forward, especially if China chooses to retaliate,"" Mr Morales said. Last week, Nvidia reported a revenue of $6.7bn in the second quarter, which was significantly lower than forecasts. However, it said revenue from its data centre business - which produces computer chips - surged by 61% from a year earlier. ""This is really a shot across the bow at China and it's really going to fan those flames in terms of geopolitical (tensions). Nvidia's caught in the crossfire,"" Mr Ives said. The US and China are locked in a long-running dispute over trade and technology. Tensions between the world's two biggest economies rose earlier this month, after US politician Nancy Pelosi made a controversial visit to Taiwan. China sees the self-ruled island as a part of its territory and insists it should be unified with the mainland, by force if necessary."
geopolitical tensions,US urges China not to 'play spoiler' at G20,2024-09-15,2023-09-06,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-66725790,"US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan has asked China to set aside its issues with India and play a ""constructive role"" in the upcoming G20 summit. Mr Sullivan said it was up to China if it ""wanted to play the role of a spoiler"" instead. His remarks come after China confirmed that its leader, Xi Jinping, would not attend the meeting.  India will host the summit in the capital Delhi on 9 and 10 September. Neither India nor China has given specific reasons behind Mr Xi's absence. China has said Premier Li Qiang will lead its delegation at the summit instead. India and China have a frosty relationship and tensions between the two countries have worsened since 2020, when their troops were involved in a deadly clash at the Galwan valley in Ladakh. The source of the tension between the neighbours is a disputed 3,440km (2,100 mile)-long de facto border along the Himalayas - which is poorly demarcated and soldiers on either side come face to face at many points. Last week, the two countries got into a diplomatic row over an ""official map"" released by China, which India said laid claim to its territory. Beijing responded by saying that Delhi should refrain from ""over-interpreting"" the issue. Asked by a reporter at a press briefing if tensions between India and China would overshadow the summit, Mr Sullivan said that that was ""up to China"".  ""If China wants to come in and play the role of spoiler, of course, that option is available to them,"" he said. But he added that the summit's chair - India - the US and ""every other member"" of the G20 would encourage China to ""come in in a constructive way on climate, on multilateral development bank reform, on debt relief, on technology, and set aside the geopolitical questions and really focus on problem-solving and delivering for the developing countries"". The G20 - or Group of Twenty - is a club of countries which meets to discuss plans for the global economy.

geopolitical tensions,Will N Korea compete in Winter Olympics?,2024-09-15,2018-01-03,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-42550446,"North and South Korea both seem keen for the North to take part in the 2018 Winter Olympic Games in the South. But there are still hurdles to overcome before North Korean skaters can take to the ice in Pyeongchang, writes North Korean leadership specialist Michael Madden. Next week, one day after Kim Jong-un's birthday, there is a very good chance that representatives of North and South Korea's unification departments will meet in the truce village in Panmunjom.  Their aim will be to discuss whether the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), the official name of North Korea, sends a delegation to the 2018 Winter Olympics, taking place in February in Pyeongchang, South Korea.  While their attendance wouldn't resolve the long-standing crisis on the Korean peninsula it would, as both sides have said, be a gesture of peace.  But before we start waiting for North Korean athletes (two figure skaters, so far) and its VIP delegation (which might include Kim Yo-jong, the younger sister and close aide of the North Korean leader) to appear in Pyeongchang, and before they even meet on 9 January, the two Koreas will need to participate in a series of careful interactions, and there's much that could yet go wrong.   The fact that South Korean President Moon Jae-in even proposed the meeting, in response to remarks Kim Jong-un made during his New Year's Day address, has sent some analysts into making overwrought and heavy handed pronouncements. They're talking about appeasement of the North, of Pyongyang using its potential participation in the Olympics as a way to extract concessions on issues of geostrategic concern, and to give voice to a ""sky is falling"" perspective that Pyongyang is attempting to drive a wedge in the South Korean-US alliance.  But it's important to note that Mr Moon's proposal and Mr Kim's remarks about the Olympics were the result of two secret meetings between South and North Korean sports officials, which took place in China in late December.   The two Koreas agreed to participate in sports exchanges during 2018.   From the North Korean side, a vice minister of athletics was sent to interact with his South Korean counterparts, who may or may not have been acting on President Moon's instructions.  Seoul and Pyongyang appeared to have leveraged this secret contact and a general agreement about sports exchanges to a potential meeting on 9 January. Based on this, and both leaders' statements, it's clear there's a high degree of enthusiasm for making this happen, and both sides are proceeding cautiously. The first step will be to have telephone conversations to plan the delegation and agenda for next week's meeting.   One hang up on this was that the North has not been answering the inter-Korea hotline when the South has dialled.   But Kim Jong-un has now ordered the reopening the North's part of the line, and the two sides have had their first direct communication in two years.   During the next few days, representatives of the two Koreas will discuss the agenda and attendees of the potential meeting to discuss the Olympics.   Even if that goes well, two things could yet prevent that 9 January meeting from taking place.   First, a DPRK representative might attempt to introduce other items that are not on the agreed agenda, slowing down the process. Secondly, if an agenda is agreed, the meeting might be thrown out because of protocol disputes. In the past, there was disagreement between the two Koreas over the appropriate ranks of counterpart officials leading to a break off in contact. The protocol issue might sound like a petty dispute to outside observers.   However, from the perspective of the North Koreans, they will want interlocutors who have the authority to make a binding decision, pending President Moon's approval, about the North's participation.   From the perspective of the South Koreans, they want DPRK counterparts who have some decision-making autonomy, and if the North makes a tentative agreement, can get the message directly to Kim Jong-un and be able to reliably advocate for it in Pyongyang's political culture (senior North Korean officials, it should be noted, have different perspectives on policy issues and debate them out amongst themselves). If there is no upstaging the agenda nor an argument about the officials participating, and the Koreas do meet, the next potential trap is that they may not be able to come to an agreement.   The North might attempt to extract some type of concession from South Korea, either a request for assistance or removing sanctions.   The South, for its part, might place restrictions on the number of cheerleaders who can attend the games, or refuse to allow additional North Korean athletes to participate.   So far, the DPRK only has two athletes who qualify for the Olympics, but President Moon has some flexibility on letting in more athletes.   Some outside analysts think that Pyongyang is using its potential participation in the Winter Olympics as a back door to undermine the international community's sanctions and diplomatic efforts intended to stop the DPRK from testing its ballistic missiles and expanding its inventory of nuclear weapons.   This is myopic and misleading.   This was, arguably, a tactic employed under late DPRK leader Kim Jong-il, but Kim Jong-un is a different leader than his father. While Kim Jong-un will certainly order continued drills of its ballistic missiles, he also wishes to see a reduction in tensions between the two Koreas and avoid any unnecessary panic about the next North Korean nuclear crisis.   Pyongyang policymakers also labour under no illusions that President Moon can prevent upcoming South Korea-US military exercises. They might ask the South to cancel the exercises, but also understand the reality that these events are planned long in advance and that Seoul does have some input as to what pieces of military equipment end up being deployed.   There is also no reason to think that once the DPRK does conduct a missile drill or even tests a nuclear device (these things, given the advanced state of the North's weapons of mass destruction programme, are a matter of when and not if) that the South Korean government won't upbraid the DPRK or even advocate for additional sanctions at the UN Security Council.   But if the North does participate in the Olympics and manages to keep its lines of communication open this reduces the likelihood of miscalculation (on both sides) which could escalate into a military conflict. President Moon Jae-in has inaccurately been labelled desperate or naive.  He has much more experience dealing with North Korea than his armchair critics.   President Moon's proposal for North Korean participation in the Winter Olympics is an incremental step that might eventually lead to further, more substantive interactions between the North and South.  For Kim Jong-un and Moon Jae-in, and to those who follow the peninsula closely, DPRK participation will be an excellent public relations opportunity, and also cause a temporary pressure drop in neighbourhood geopolitical tensions.   The 2016 selfie of North Korean and South Korean gymnasts was a viral moment that showed that athletes can put aside the political differences and provocative activities of their respective governments and compete in an atmosphere of respect and love of sport.  To those critiquing President Moon's proposal, one needs ask: do we want the Koreans competing in sports and talking to one another, or do we want them threatening to kill each other?

geopolitical tensions,US will end Russian pipeline if Ukraine invaded,2024-09-15,2022-02-07,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-60292437,"US President Joe Biden has vowed to shut down a key Russian gas pipeline to Germany if Moscow invades Ukraine. Speaking after talks with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz in Washington, Mr Biden said the US would ""bring an end"" to the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. Their talks came as French President Emmanuel Macron met Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow and expressed hope that war could be avoided. There are growing Western fears of a Russian invasion, which Moscow denies. Russia currently has more than 100,000 troops massed on Ukraine's borders.  US officials said on Sunday that Russia has assembled 70% of military forces needed for a full-scale invasion. In recent weeks, Moscow has demanded that the Western military alliance Nato ban Ukraine from ever becoming a member, and that the group cuts its troop numbers in eastern Europe.  Nato has rejected both demands. It has instead suggested talks on other areas, such as limiting nuclear weapons. The tensions between Russia, Ukraine and the West come nearly eight years after Russia annexed Ukraine's southern Crimea peninsula and backed a bloody rebellion in the eastern Donbas region. Moscow accuses the Ukrainian government of failing to implement the Minsk agreement - an international deal sponsored by Germany and France to restore peace to the east, where Russian-backed rebels control swathes of territory and at least 14,000 people have been killed since 2014. Mr Biden and Mr Scholz held a press conference after their discussions in the US capital on Monday. When asked about Nord Stream 2, the US president said ""if Russia invades... again, then there will be longer Nord Stream 2. We will bring an end to it."" However he did not give specifics, responding to a question about how he would do this by saying: ""I promise you we will be able to do it."" Mr Scholz - on his first trip to Washington since become Chancellor and under criticism for his response to the Ukraine crisis - was more ambiguous about the pipeline.  But he did say the US and Germany were ""absolutely united"" on sanctions against Russia should it invade Ukraine, saying ""we will do the same steps and they will be very, very hard to Russia"". The 1,225km (760-mile) Nord Stream 2 pipeline took five years to build and cost $11bn (£8bn). The energy project, which would run under the Baltic Sea, is designed to double Russia's gas exports to Germany. But as yet it has not started operating, as regulators said in November it does not comply with German law and suspended its approval. Major European businesses have invested heavily in Nord Stream 2. But many groups object to the plan. Environmentalists question how it will fit in with German efforts to cut emissions and tackle man-made climate change, while politicians at home and abroad fear it could increase Europe's dependence on Russian energy. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has previously described the pipeline as a ""dangerous geopolitical weapon"". Germany's new Chancellor Olaf Scholz is making his first trip to Washington amid criticism of a weak response to the Ukraine crisis.  Republican members of congress have portrayed Berlin as a brake on sanctions because of its interest in maintaining gas imports from Russia.  After meeting the chancellor President Biden insisted that Nord Stream2 would not become operational if Moscow invaded Ukraine.  Mr Scholz did not go that far, citing the need for strategic ambiguity. But he stressed that the US and Germany would be absolutely united in taking the same steps in response to any invasion, and that these steps would be very hard.  Mr Biden went out of his way to dispel the suggestion that Germany was not a reliable ally, insisting several times he had no doubt that it was."
geopolitical tensions,How Asia is divided over Russia sanctions,2024-09-15,2022-03-11,By Mariko Oi,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60672278,"Since its invasion of Ukraine, Russia has become the world's most sanctioned country. But only a few governments in Asia have taken tough action against Moscow. China has refused to outright condemn the invasion of Ukraine and has not imposed any sanctions on Russia. India, Pakistan, Vietnam, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Laos and Mongolia also sat out the vote on a United Nations' resolution to demand the end of Russia's military operations in Ukraine. While Western allies like Australia, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan have imposed sanctions, with Tokyo and Seoul blocking some Russian banks from the Swift global payments system, the impact is limited.  That is because the Asian nations who joined western-led sanctions make up only 8% of Russia's global trade. ""Without having the two Asian giants China and India on board on sanctions who account for 18% of Russia's trade, there is unlikely to be any significant impact on Russia,"" says Professor Syed Munir Khasru, chairman of the international think tank, the Institute for Policy, Advocacy, and Governance. And President Putin has been preparing in advance. Since Russia annexed Crimea eight years ago, Moscow has been targeted with Western sanctions.  ""After 2014, Russia started cutting down the reliance on US dollars as part of foreign currency reserve and moving to gold and the Chinese yuan,"" he adds.  For Beijing, it is about weighing up the benefits versus costs of not taking action against Russia.  China is already Russia's largest trading partner and in the weeks before the invasion, Beijing lifted restrictions on wheat imports and signed a 30-year deal to buy more Russian gas.  Meanwhile, an increasing number of Russian companies and banks, including the oil arm of Russian gas giant Gazprom, has started using China's currency, the yuan, in settlements.  China has three objectives, according to Bilahari Kausikan, Singapore's former ambassador to the UN and Russia. Firstly, China is quite sensitive about certain principles of international relations, such as sovereignty, territorial integrity and non-interference because of Tibet, Xinjiang and Taiwan. ""Russia's invasion of Ukraine is a direct and gross violation of these norms but there is a second objective. China has no other partner, anywhere near the strategic weight of Russia,"" Mr Kausikan says.  They also share a discomfort with a Western-dominated international order but Mr Kausikan adds that ""China is much more invested in that order"" and ""the US, Europe and Japan are more important markets than Russia"", which is why Beijing is keen to stabilise the situation in order to avoid becoming collateral damage of the Russian sanctions. For India and Vietnam, Russia is their largest arms supplier while Pakistan's prime minister Imran Khan was in Moscow last month to discuss a major gas pipeline deal with President Putin. ""India has a very large stock of Soviet era weapons that it needs to keep operational,"" says Mr Kausikan. ""And the reason he needs to keep them operational is China."" Despite its strong ties with Russia however, India is also part of the US-led Quad with Japan and Australia, which is seen by many as an alliance against China's growing presence in the region. ""Whose side is India on?,"" tweeted the country's former ambassador to Russia, Pankaj Saran. ""We are on our side."" In many ways, that is how Asia's actions against Russia can be seen.  Governments here are no stranger to having to pick a side on anything from trade conflicts to human rights issues but they have invariably been pragmatic when it comes to economic issues.  ""India, the largest democracy in the world, you would have expected it to have condemned the Russian invasion,"" says Professor Munir. ""But nations are more driven by their own geopolitical and economic interests, and less by principles or respect for international norms."" And the UN vote on condemning the invasion of Ukraine further highlight divisions in the region. North Korea was one of the five countries - which unsurprisingly included Russia - to vote against the resolution.  Myanmar voted to condemn Russia but that can be put down to its UN representative being part of its ousted government in exile. The country's military junta, which grabbed power last year, has been openly supportive of Russia, which continued to supply Myanamar with weapons despite the coup. Other smaller Asian economies find themselves caught between Russia, China and the West, according to Chong Ja Ian, an associate professor at the NUS Department of Political Science. ""In general, they avoid criticising major powers like China and Russia which they believe are likely to punish them,"" says Associate Professor Chong. ""There is recognition that Russian aggression is egregious and also challenges the institution of sovereignty on which they depend, so they choose to keep silent as they do not want to criticise Moscow but also do not support it,"" he adds. He points out that even among western allies, ""South Korea is more cautious as they see a need to work with Russia on North Korea issues and because they are also cautious about crossing China unnecessarily"". What worries Asian governments, many of which have territorial disputes with China, is that Beijing is seen as closely watching what happens in Ukraine for what it may or may not be able to achieve in future disputes. ""Most Asian countries want a Chinese presence in the Indo-Pacific balanced by the United States,"" says Manjari Chatterjee Miller, Senior Fellow for India, Pakistan and South Asia at Council on Foreign Relations.  But she says that India and many South East Asian countries want Russia to play a balancing role when it comes to China.  While that explains why some countries have chosen not to outright condemn Russia, the flip side is: what lessons could China draw from the Russian invasion? ""What would it spell to China if Russia was unable to be constrained? If sanctions didn't work? What would that mean for Chinese encroachment in the Indo-Pacific or for the future of Taiwan?"" Where it is going to get tricky, she says, is as oil prices go up, the invasion drags on, and the atrocities pile up, how long the fence sitters can stay silent."
geopolitical tensions,How to negotiate with world's most secretive country,2024-09-15,2023-07-25,By Chelsea Bailey,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66296792,"A country with closed borders and few diplomatic channels... talking to North Korea is tricky at the best of times. The stakes were even higher when a young American soldier was in their hands. How could the US have gone about his release? Private Travis King was released to US custody on Wednesday after being held for more than two months by North Korea. He crossed illegally into the country on 18 July. Since then, his condition and the details of his confinement in North Korea have been unclear.  The incident posed a key challenge for the US, as it never had an official diplomatic relationship with North Korea. As a result, the US relies on a network of backchannels to negotiate the return of citizens detained in the country. Sweden was involved with the Pvt King case, a spokesman for the Swedish embassy in the US has confirmed. It is believed the 23-year-old soldier was detained and questioned by North Korean authorities.   Pvt King was last seen running across the demilitarised zone separating North and South Korea. Tensions then escalated in the region, with North Korea firing two ballistic missiles into the sea on 26 July after a US nuclear-powered submarine was stationed in the South.  ""All sides are trying to understand what happened and what to do,"" said Mickey Bergman, executive director of the Richardson Center for Global Diplomacy. Mr Bergman, who has spent nearly 20 years negotiating to return US citizens from hostile nations, said the best chance at releasing a prisoner is right after they are detained. This is when they are likely being interrogated by the country's officials but before they have been charged with a crime, like spying. It was in that time before things became official that negotiators could best appeal to people's humanity, Mr Bergman said. ""I think there's a misconception about what negotiations are,"" he said.  ""If we pound our chests, and flip tables, and demand that the evil North Koreans return our soldier, we are likely going to cause them to dig in."" Here is how the US has previously negotiated for an American citizen's return.  Because the United States has never officially held diplomatic ties with North Korea, during a detainee crisis, Sweden has served as an intermediary from their embassy in Pyongyang and has helped to relay communications to North Korean officials.   But there are also backchannels. North Korea maintains a mission at the United Nations in New York. In times of crisis, the mission - dubbed the New York Channel - has become an avenue for officials for both countries to hold talks.   For years, Robert King was one of the first people who received a call when an American was captured by North Korea. As the former special envoy for North Korean human rights at the US state department, the ambassador has helped negotiate for the release of multiple detainees including student Otto Warmbier and American missionary Kenneth Bae.    After 17 months in captivity, US college student Otto Warmbier was released from North Korean detention in 2017 in a comatose state. He returned to the United States with extensive brain damage and died days after reuniting with his family.  Otto Warmbier's death sparked international outrage and his family has levelled allegations of abuse and torture against the North Koreans. After a brief period of diplomacy under the Trump administration, Mr King said renewed political tensions between the two countries often colour negotiations, making detainees a pawn in wider geopolitical fights. ""[The North Koreans] see this as, 'how do we use this opportunity to make the US look bad?' And whatever happens it's not going to be a happy outcome,"" Mr King said.  For nearly 20 years, Mr Bergman has worked alongside former New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson to secure the release of prisoners from countries hostile to the United States.   Although the Richardson Center is not involved in the Travis King case, Mr Bergman said in his experience, when it came to North Korea, there was no playbook for negotiations.  Instead, he said, it is best to approach tense negotiations through what he calls ""fringe diplomacy"".  US non-profit-making organisations and humanitarian agencies have provided aid to North Koreans for decades. When official channels stall, these non-governmental backchannels are often called upon to negotiate on behalf of a detainee's family.  An NGO's separation from the US government is a benefit, Mr Bergman said, because it allows negotiations to focus solely on the wellbeing and return of the detainee, instead of global politics. ""People can talk to us about policy issues but there's nothing we can do about that,"" he said. ""We are much more able to insulate the issue and come up with pathways to resolve some of these situations.""  Mr Bergman said the world often focuses on the moment of ""intervention,"" when a political prisoner is rescued and returned home. But that moment, he said, is not possible without years of meaningful engagement.  ""You have to build relationships so that when there is a crisis, you're not starting from scratch.""  But the Covid pandemic has made both of these avenues of negotiation more challenging.  North Korea completely closed its borders during the pandemic and Mr Bergman said it is unclear if the Swedish Embassy in Pyongyang has returned to full capacity.  Complicating matters further, after a brief period of attempted diplomacy, the Trump administration imposed a travel ban to North Korea, rendering US passports and visas invalid.  The ban has remained in place under the Biden administration and has effectively ended humanitarian avenues for engagement, Mr Bergman said.  ""North Korea is the only country in the world where there's a travel ban, that it's illegal for Americans to travel,"" he said. ""The North Koreans see that as an insult."" Mr Bergman, who was involved in the negotiations for Warmbier's release, said he believes the international blowback over Otto Warmbier's death has shifted the North Korean perspective on political detainees, and the country may be more amenable to compromise. ""After dealing with the Otto Warmbier negotiations, and the very tragic outcome, I believe that the North Koreans have chosen not play in the game of political prisoners anymore,"" he said.  Now that Pvt King has been released, what happens next remains to be seen. "
geopolitical tensions,Should the West suspect Chinese tech?,2024-09-15,2018-04-17,By Karishma Vaswani,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-43797068,"Both the US and UK have issued warnings about the Chinese technology and telecoms giant ZTE.  The decision by the US Commerce Department to ban American firms from selling equipment to ZTE for the next seven years dates back to a case from a few years ago, when ZTE was accused by the US government of violating sanctions against Iran.  At the time, the US said if ZTE refused to comply, there would be consequences. This week, the US made good on those threats and is hitting ZTE where it hurts. A shortage of US components is likely to cause ZTE to miss shipment deadlines and lose orders, according to investment firm Jefferies. It has cut its estimates for ZTE sales by 13.5% in 2018 and 7.6% in 2019. ZTE's chairman Yin Yimin has reportedly said this is a ""crisis"" and called for his 80,000 strong staff to remain calm, according to a leaked memo seen by the South China Morning Post.  And it's not just the US.  In a seemingly unrelated case, the UK on Monday warned companies about doing business with ZTE, saying its cyber-defence watchdog has blacklisted the Chinese firm over concerns of national security. Granted, these are two different issues, but the incidents highlight one glaring fact: the West is increasingly suspicious of Chinese tech. That suspicion is complicated by the current ""geopolitical tension"", says Chris DeAngelis of the ADG group in Beijing.  Regardless of whether there is truth to the national security concerns, the real issue, he says, is that the US and the UK want to ensure the survival of globally competitive firms that compete with ZTE. The geopolitical tension Mr DeAngelis is referring to is the ongoing trade row between the US and China.  At the heart of this spat, as I've said before, is that the US says China forced American companies that wanted access to low-cost labour and the massive market to tie up with Chinese companies - in effect allowing them to copy and steal American ideas.  China says that's not true, and Beijing has been very vocal about the way it perceives its firms are being treated by the West. China's Ministry of Commerce has urged the United States to ""create fair, just, and stable legal and policy environment for Chinese companies"", with regards to the ZTE decision. And perhaps more notably, it also said it was prepared to take action to protect the interests of Chinese firms.  ZTE is not the only Chinese tech firm that's been targeted by the West.  China's Huawei, for example, has been blocked from striking a deal to sell its new smartphone via a US carrier over security concerns. And Broadcom, a firm formerly domiciled in Singapore, had its bid to takeover Qualcomm blocked because of US national security concerns that specifically cited Huawei and Chinese technology. At the crux of this is a suspicion that Chinese companies are the eyes and ears of the Chinese government in Western markets. Whether those suspicions are warranted is hard to prove, but ""there is no question that telecom and communications is a valid security risk"", Mr DeAngelis told me. ""If you have a problem in a network, do you really want to rely on your vendor if you are in the middle of a trade war, for example?"" he said. Most of the narrative on Chinese tech is that they've copied American ideas and then sold them back to the West at cheaper prices.  While that may have been true in the past, it's certainly not fair to say that today.  My experience of reporting on Chinese tech over the last few years has shown me that Chinese companies are innovating at a pace that is often unparalleled by other countries. Recently, Chinese firms have also beaten global firms in China, as ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing proved recently by driving Uber out. Some say the West's fear originates in envy and an ignorance of just how hard Chinese firms can make their staff work. ""Unless people have seen the Chinese tech culture known as 996, they don't understand Chinese tech,"" writes Lawrence Kuok in supchina.com. (The number 996 refers to the Chinese tech firms' practice of working from 9am to 9pm, six days a week.)  ""What I think a lot of people don't understand about the Chinese market is that there are many aspects that require pure and utter hard work,"" he said. Chinese tech firms do get help from their government, in the form of protection of the domestic market, which has allowed them to grow and dominate in China. That's not to say they're not formidable players in their own right, though.  But China, and Chinese firms, are used to having a longer term view. ""No road that leads to a bright future is straight,"" says ZTE's Mr Yin in that leaked memo. ""The company's internationalisation will also have its ups and downs… we will be stronger after weathering the storm."""
geopolitical tensions,Russia’s Shoigu in rare North Korea visit,2024-09-15,2023-07-26,By Derek Cai,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-66309231,"A Russian delegation led by Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu has arrived in North Korea, to be joined by a Chinese delegation later on Wednesday. They will attend Pyongyang's celebrations of the 70th anniversary of the end of the Korean War, marked typically by massive military parades.  The visits are the first of their kind to the North since it shut its borders to try to keep out the pandemic.  It is unclear if this signals a change in Pyongyang's border policies.  Reclusive North Korea had sealed itself off from all trade and diplomatic ties in early 2020, even with Russia and China, its main economic and political partners.  They even cut off imports of essential goods like food and medicine.  North Korea has been facing food shortages, which have been made worse by its border closure and strict international sanctions that have been imposed because of its nuclear programme. Some analysts say the inclusion of Chinese and Russian envoys in this year's ""Victory Day"" parade - as the 1953 Korean armistice is called in the North - hints at a possible loosening of Covid restrictions.  It comes weeks after images of North Koreans walking around without masks were shown on state media.  The Russian delegation arrived in North Korea late on Tuesday, and received a warm welcome on the tarmac at an airport in Pyongyang. Mr Shoigu walked past a line of saluting soldiers and a red banner emblazoned with the words, ""Welcome, Comrade Defence Minister of the Russian Federation Sergei Shoigu!"" in both Korean and Russian. The Chinese delegation will be led by Li Hongzhong, who is part of the Chinese Communist Party's central policymaking committee, and will arrive some time on Wednesday, according to a party spokesperson.  China and Russia are both long time allies of North Korea.  Beijing had sent troops in the autumn of 1950 to support North Korea in the war against South Korea. The then Soviet Union also supported North Korea in the war.  Since the collapse of the USSR in 1991, Russia has remained a natural ally for North Korea because of their mutual dislike for the US. Washington has, in fact, accused North Korea of providing military aid to Russia in its war in Ukraine, a claim that both Pyongyang and Moscow deny.  Mr Shoigu's visit also comes against the backdrop of rising geopolitical tensions between the US and Russia over the Ukraine war. Ties between Beijing and Washington are also frayed because of Taiwan.  The US has been trying to talk to Pyongyang after US soldier Travis King fled to North Korea last week.  Private King, who was meant to go back to the US to face disciplinary action, ran into North Korea while on a tour at the Joint Security Area (JSA), an area in the Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) that divides North and South Korea.  The United Nations Command, which the United States is part of, said on Monday that dialogue had taken place with North Korea over Pvt King, but did not provide any details. "
geopolitical tensions,HSBC boss out in top-level reshuffle,2024-09-15,2019-08-04,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-49230568,"The chief executive of HSBC has stepped down after the bank said it needed a change in leadership to address a ""challenging global environment"". John Flint is giving up the role he has held for a year-and-a-half ""by mutual agreement with the board"". He will immediately cease his day-to-day responsibilities at HSBC, but will help with the transition as Noel Quinn takes over as interim chief executive.  Chairman Mark Tucker thanked Mr Flint for his ""commitment"" and ""dedication"".  However, he said: ""In the increasingly complex and challenging global environment in which the bank operates, the board believes a change is needed to meet the challenges that we face and to capture the very significant opportunities before us."" HSBC made the surprise announcement as it reported a 15.8% rise in pre-tax profit to $12.4bn (£10.2bn) for the six months to 30 June.  Mr Flint, who has worked at HSBC for 30 years, said: ""I have agreed with the board that today's good interim results indicate that this is the right time for change, both for me and the bank.""  The 51-year-old ran the bank's retail and wealth management business before taking over as chief executive last year. At that time, Mr Flint was seen as a safe choice for the top job.  HSBC portrays itself as a conservative bank.  Unlike some rivals, it has never pursued the wilder excesses of investment banking, and has a proud record of appointing its chief executive and chairman from within. It is part of the establishment in Asia and the West, and makes its money from the giant trade flows between. With a 30-year track record at the bank, John Flint appeared the safest of hands when appointed 18 months ago. The bank's shares have fallen during his tenure, but the increasing trade tensions between America and China explain most of the fall. Mr Flint will be a ""good leaver"" - meaning he keeps his entitlement to most of his share options - and which rules out any idea his departure is linked to misconduct.  Mr Flint was regarded as the favourite of his predecessor as chief executive, Stuart Gulliver - so it is possible that Mark Tucker, HSBC's chairman, has simply decided he wants his own man in the job. But the Huawei connection, although not confirmed by HSBC, cannot be discounted. In seeking to keep in the good books of the US authorities - which had a monitor embedded at the bank - HSBC provided the information that allowed America to apply for the extradition of Meng Wanzhou, Huawei's chief financial officer. That cannot have pleased Beijing, and HSBC is reliant on China's goodwill as much as America's. Mr Flint may have been the necessary sacrifice. Commenting on the current environment, HSBC said ""the outlook has changed"".  It said that US interest rates were now expected to fall rather than rise and ""geopolitical issues could impact a significant number of our major markets"". It added: ""In the near term, the nature and impact of the UK's departure from the European Union remain highly uncertain."" Mr Flint has a 12-month notice period, but it is not clear when his departure date will be, because he has ""agreed to remain available to HSBC"". HSBC has also granted Mr Flint ""good leaver"" status, which means he will be entitled to any stock options that vest after he exits the bank, provided he does not work at a competitor for two years.  The bank said it has begun a search to find a new chief executive and ""will be considering internal and external candidates""."
geopolitical tensions,CHAN: Morocco 'ultimatum' still overshadowing tournament,2024-09-15,2023-01-27,Maher Mezahi,https://www.bbc.com/sport/africa/64425952,"Ivory Coast have been joyful in their success at CHAN so far The 2022 African Nations Championship (CHAN) quarter-finals begin on Friday, and there are plenty of captivating storylines primed to unfold. Hosts Algeria steamrolled through Group A and look like early favourites; Senegal have scores of young talent that seem ripe for European football; and debutants Madagascar have also secured a historic berth in the knockout stages. But, the main story of the CHAN is still not about what happened on the pitch so much as the overall organisation of the tournament and its geopolitical implications. Defending champions Morocco did not make it out to Algeria for the CHAN, pulling out on the eve of its starting citing logistical reasons after the team was denied permission to fly directly from Morocco to Algeria using their national airline. And this row has overshadowed everything since. Algeria unilaterally ruptured relations with neighbours Morocco in August 2021, for various geopolitical reasons, and have since also prohibited Moroccan aircraft from flying in Algerian airspace. In December, Morocco football federation (FRMF) president Fouzi Lekjaa announced that unless the team could fly directly from Moroccan capital Rabat to Algerian city Constantine where they would be based, on board a Royal Air Maroc flight, the Atlas Lions would pull out. Rachid Oukali, the president of the organising committee of the Chan (COCHAN), told BBC Sport Africa that his body received nothing directly from the Moroccan authorities and that the FRMF statement was ill-received. “Initially, we, as a committee, and the Algerian authorities wanted to facilitate things for all participating nations,” Oukali explained.“After the statement, it became more of an ultimatum, and that’s when things became more difficult.” “We would have liked to have them here for this Chan, but unfortunately that wasn’t the case.” Political remarks The CHAN opening ceremony doubled as the opening of the Nelson Mandela Stadium In addition to Morocco’s non-participation, another source of controversy during the initial stages of the Chan was the opening ceremony at freshly inaugurated Nelson Mandela stadium in Algiers.  As the new stadium was named after the former South African freedom fighter, Algerian authorities decided to invite his grandson, Zwelivelile ""Mandla” Mandela, to deliver remarks on behalf of the family. However, Mandela ended up making explicitly political statements including, “Let us fight to free Western Sahara from oppression”, and “Free Palestine”. The disputed territory in Northwest Africa has long been a source of tension between Algeria and Morocco and the latter were quick to file a letter to both CAF and Fifa, calling Mandela’s comments, “obviously premeditated and totally unacceptable. Oukali denies that Mandela’s comments were premeditated. “The stadium is named after Nelson Mandela, so that is why we invited his grandson for the inauguration,” he told Sport Africa. “We had nothing to do with his speech and he himself confirmed that. In fact, as he was preparing to descend onto the pitch to make his speech, he told his wife that he would be improvising, so no one knew what he would end up saying.” Oukali continued. “As the president of the COCHAN, we wanted to stay in a footballing context, but couldn’t control what he was going to say."" Once the matches got underway Oukali is happy about the general success of the tournament thus far. “Everything is going well, as expected,” he says. “All of our guests agree that this seventh edition of the CHAN has been great. The fans have come out in numbers, even in cities like Annaba and Constantine where the home national team isn’t playing. In one match we had a record 30,000 supporters who showed up to watch a neutral fixture.” For now, the Maghrebi kerfuffle seems to be forgotten but it promises to stretch into the following months as Morocco have qualified for the under-17 Africa Cup of Nations, which will also be hosted in Algeria this April. The North African nations are also the two leading contenders to host the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations that was initially supposed to be held in Guinea. "
geopolitical tensions,What is Eurovision really about?,2024-09-15,2014-10-21,Fiona Macdonald,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20140509-geopolitics-and-drag-queens,"The Eurovision Song Contest brings together world affairs and shiny pop. BBC Culture picks five of its more bizarre motifs. It’s the most watched music event in the world, and it combines geopolitics with trampolines, trapeze artists and men running on hamster wheels: this year’s Eurovision Song Contest reaches its final on Saturday night. So far, one entrant has faced a ""transphobic backlash”, while current tensions between Russia and Ukraine hit the stage in the first semi-final. The 17-year-old Tolmachevy twins, Russia’s selection, were booed by the audience; their song Shine features lyrics that hint perhaps at the situation in Ukraine: “Living on the edge / closer to the crime / cross the line a step at a time”. After the country’s pro-democracy revolution in 2005 Ukraine was awarded just two points by Russia, which had given its neighbour the maximum 12 points the year before. Yet away from world affairs, the contest – which has been running since 1956 – continues to provide show-stopping pop of a unique kind. BBC Culture has pored through the Eurovision archives to find key trends embodied by some of this year’s crop. Bearded ladies Who knew this could be a trend? Conchita Wurst’s selection for Austria this year, despite making headlines, is not the first time a woman with facial hair has graced the Eurovision stage. In 2008, France’s Sebastien Tellier came on stage in a golf cart clutching a transparent globe, accompanied by five bearded female backing singers. He placed 19th. Honourable mention for taking hirsute to the next level should go to Estonian band Winny Puhh for their 2013 Eurovision performance, with a death metal spin on Chewbacca. Accordions Among the folk instruments banged, rattled or strummed over the past decades – from cowbells to dulcimers – the accordion reigns supreme. This year, Germany’s entrants Elaiza are wheezing their way through a song that mixes ‘neo-folk’ with dirge. Some acts have subverted the instrument’s folky associations: in 2013, Greece brought together ska, punk and Rebetiko styles for a song alluding to the country’s debt crisis. In 2007, Ukraine’s Verka Serduckha came second with one of Eurovision’s most memorable acts ever. Heavy on rouge and sequinned epaulettes, the drag queen performed a song perhaps best described as ‘accordion rave’ alongside enthusiastic backing dancers in tin foil uniforms. Twins The Tolmachevy Sisters won Junior Eurovision in 2006, at the age of nine, and will appear on a giant seesaw with intertwined ponytails in an apparent effort to promote Russia’s softer side. They have illustrious predecessors: identical pair Jedward represented Ireland in 2011 and 2012, breaking through with Lipstick, which finished 8th, and repeating their aerial gymnastics – dressed as robot knights, complete with a fountain – for Waterline. Baffling lyrics Latvia didn’t make it through this year’s semi-final stage with their entry: called Bake A Cake, its profound insights into the human condition included the line ""I talked to a unicorn the other night… he did a moonwalk on the Milky Way"". While lyrics over the years have included Switzerland’s ""When Djambo Djambo plays his barrel organ, children call it circus in the streets"" and Serbia’s “My old shoe, it saw half of the world”, arguably nothing can beat France’s 1961 entry – Jean-Paul Mauric, who chirpily chanted “bing et bong, et bing et bong” to describe animals’ spring awakening after hibernation. Strange props Ukraine’s choice of a human hamster wheel is far down on the list of strangest props in Eurovision history. Peter, Sue & Marc – of Djambo Djambo fame – represented Switzerland four times, in four different languages (French, English, German and Italian). Their 1979 attempt, Trödler & Co, featured bin bags, hoses and a watering can; a collection that baffled immigration officials who refused them entry to that year’s Eurovision host nation, Israel. Eventually allowed in, they finished 10th – this clip reveals an ingenious application of cake slices and a drum-kit rubbish bin.

geopolitical tensions,Holiday Inn hotels hit by cyber-attack,2024-09-15,2022-09-06,By Shiona McCallum,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-62814943,"Holiday Inn owner, Intercontinental Hotels Group (IHG), has confirmed the company has been hit by a cyber-attack. IHG, which has some of the world's largest hotel chains, issued a statement saying it was investigating ""unauthorised access"" to a number of its technology systems. The UK-based company said its ""booking channels and other applications"" had been disrupted since Monday. It manages the Holiday Inn, Crowne Plaza and Regent hotels.   ""IHG is working to fully restore all systems as soon as possible,"" the company said. IHG confirmed it was assessing the nature, extent and impact of the incident and had implemented its response plans, including appointing external specialists to investigate the breach. The company is also in the process of notifying regulatory authorities. In a statement, the company said: ""We will be supporting hotel owners and operators as part of our response to the ongoing service disruption. IHG's hotels are still able to operate and to take reservations directly."" But many people trying to book accommodation have been complaining. IHG did not say there had been any loss of customer data.  It also did not specifically say it was a ransomware attack, but most of the speculation points in that direction. Last month, a Holiday Inn in Istanbul was breached by LockBit, which released data stolen from the company.  It is not known if there is a connection between the attacks. The hotel chain was also the target of a three-month security breach in 2017 when more than 1,200 of its franchised hotels in the US were affected. The hack comes amid increased scrutiny on appropriate defences against cyber-attacks, particularly on Western financial institutions, in the wake of heightened geopolitical tensions following Russia's invasion of Ukraine early this year."
geopolitical tensions,UK forecast to have slowest growth in G7 next year,2024-09-15,2022-04-19,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-61142906,"The war in Ukraine will ""severely set back"" the global economic recovery with the UK hit harder than most, the International Monetary Fund has said.  The conflict is driving up prices for food and fuel which the international body expects to slow growth globally. It has cut its global forecast and also downgraded its outlook for the UK. This means the UK will no longer be the fastest growing economy in the G7 group of leading Western nations, and will be the slowest in 2023, it says. The body says that UK growth will slow as price pressures lead households to cut spending, while rising interest rates are expected to ""cool investment"". The UK's economy is now predicted to grow by 3.7% this year, down from the previous forecast of 4.7% made in January. However, next year, the UK is expected to have the slowest growth in the G7 and across Europe's main economies, at just 1.2%, a near halving from the 2.3% expected previously. The 2023 UK figure is the slowest apart from heavily-sanctioned Russia in the wider G20 grouping, which includes nations such as China and India. The IMF said that the UK was the fastest growing G7 economy in 2021, and is forecast to be the second fastest in 2022. The low UK growth rates forecast in 2023 are in part due to the UK rebounding more quickly from the pandemic than some of its G7 peers. However, the UK is also wrestling with high inflation, which will hit growth in 2023, as people cut spending as their real income shrinks, the IMF said. The organisation expects inflation to peak in late 2022 at 9%. It said rising interest rates will also slow the UK economy in 2023 and 2023, while government policies such as getting rid of certain tax breaks will reduce business investment at that time. In addition, Brexit will hold back export growth, the IMF said, and it will continue to make pandemic-related labour supply ""scarring"" worse by reducing immigration. ""However, the impact of Brexit is spread over several years and is not the primary driver of the slowdown in 2023,"" a spokesperson for the organisation added. The IMF works with its 189 member countries to try to stabilise the global economy, including issuing short-term loans and assistance to countries who are struggling. It said inflation was now a ""clear and present danger"" in many countries and the situation has added to supply strains from the coronavirus pandemic. ""In the matter of a few weeks, the world has yet again experienced a major, transformative shock,"" IMF director of research Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas wrote in the organisation's 2022 World Economic Outlook. ""Just as a durable recovery from the pandemic-induced global economic collapse appeared in sight, the war has created the very real prospect that a large part of the recent gains will be erased.""  The organisation said it expected global growth of just 3.6% this year, down nearly a percentage point from its forecast before the war.  The World Bank also said it was lowering its growth forecast from 4.1% to 3.2%.  The conflict has already devastated the economies of Ukraine and Russia, which the West cut off from key trade and financial networks with sanctions following the invasion. Ukraine is facing a severe contraction of 35% or more this year, while Russia's economy is expected to shrink by 8.5%, the IMF said. But with Russia a major energy producer and key supplier of staples such as wheat and corn alongside Ukraine, the consequences will ripple far beyond their borders, the IMF warned. There have been two acute shocks to the world economy in quick succession - the pandemic and the Ukraine war. The latter is building on the problems created by the former, tripping up what had been a healthy recovery, and sending prices rising at an even faster rate. Food and energy prices were already being hiked by the supply bottlenecks after the pandemic, before one of the world's biggest energy suppliers invaded one of the world's biggest food exporter. But now there are new bottlenecks emerging from the stringent Covid lockdowns in some regions of China. Rising prices risk social stability in poorer countries, dependent on food imports. Fears about inflation becoming entrenched are leading the world's central bankers to raise interest rates. In turn that is raising the cost of borrowing for the record debts many nations racked up during the pandemic. So all this requires some skill and cooperation among the old and new financial powerhouses of the world. But that has been another commodity in short supply in recent times. ""The economic effects of the war are spreading far and wide - like seismic waves that emanate from the epicenter of an earthquake,"" it said. In Germany, where the economy is especially closely entwined, the war is likely to lower growth by 1.7 percentage points, it said. Even in countries with little direct trade with Russia and Ukraine, households will feel the effects of the war, as central banks respond to the more rapid inflation by raising interest rates, making borrowing more expensive, the IMF said. In the US, for example, the organisation lowered its forecast for growth in 2022 by 0.3 percentage points to 3.7%, citing the prospect of more aggressive interest rate rises.  Overall, inflation pressures are significantly worse than they were when the IMF issued its previous forecast in January. It now predicts inflation in ""advanced economies"" will hit 5.7% this year, while it is likely to reach 8.7% in emerging markets.  UK inflation is expected to be 5.3% next year - the highest in the G7, and higher than all EU members, and only exceeded in the G20 by crisis-ridden Argentina, Turkey and Russia. ""Inflation has become a clear and present danger for many countries,"" Mr Gourinchas wrote in a blog. A few countries, such as oil exporters, are benefiting. The IMF expects growth in Saudi Arabia, for example, to be stronger than it did in January. But the risks are not purely economic, the IMF added.  It said the war had also created a refugee crisis and aggravated political tensions, risking a ""more permanent fragmentation of the world economy into geopolitical blocks with distinct technology standards, cross-border payment systems, and reserve currencies"".  ""Such a 'tectonic shift' would cause long-run efficiency losses, increase volatility and represent a major challenge to the rules-based framework that has governed international and economic relations for the last 75 years,"" the IMF said. A Treasury spokesperson said the IMF forecasts ""will be concerning for many people and families"" in the UK. ""However the support we provided over the past two years has put our economy in a good position to deal with these headwinds, including through record numbers of employees on payrolls and a strong economic recovery from the pandemic,"" the spokesperson said. Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said the IMF forecast ""shows the extreme challenges facing the UK economy"". ""While it is true that global forces play a role, the fact that the UK is forecast to have the slowest growth of any G7 economy next year plus the highest inflation, shows the uniquely bad situation the UK is in. ""Inflation spiralling out of control this year has created a cost of living crisis hitting families across the country, needing decisive and urgent action,"" she said, repeating Labour calls for a windfall tax on oil and gas firms. Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Christine Jardine said the UK government had ""failed to shield the UK from spiralling energy bills and soaring inflation, but they have gone ahead with raising people's taxes to their highest point in 70 years""."
geopolitical tensions,The Olympic skier caught in a China-US divide,2024-09-15,2022-02-07,By Boer Deng & Anamaria Silic,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-60277353,"On Monday, world champion skier Eileen Gu made her Olympic debut in the women's big air qualification round. But even before that, Ms Gu - also known as China's ""Snow Princess"" - was already known to millions. A teenage US-born athlete, Ms Gu is indisputably a gifted skier. At 18, she has already won eight international skiing events, claiming gold for the big air event in the 2020 Winter Youth Olympics in Lausanne and medalling three times at the Winter X Games in Aspen, Colorado, last year.  She started her quest for medals at the Beijing Games in spectacular fashion, claiming gold in the ski big air with her third and final jump. But it is not her podium odds in Beijing that are sparking the most provocative discussions about her.  A San Francisco native who learned to ski on the pristine slopes of California's Lake Tahoe, she is representing China, not the USA, in the Olympics - a move that has come at a sensitive time for Sino-American relations, and has inevitably placed Ms Gu at the centre of a global debate on geopolitics and representation. And for all that she has attempted to deflect questions about her identity, citizenship status and thoughts on political issues, they are unlikely to go away. Is she an American or a Chinese woman? And is it possible to be both in a world where the two nations have strained relations? When Ms Gu began her competitive skiing career in 2018, she did so as an American, but switched her affiliation to the International Ski Federation the following year. In making the announcement, Ms Gu - the daughter of an American father and first-generation Chinese immigrant mother - said she wanted ""the opportunity to help inspire millions of young people during the Winter Olympics in Beijing - my mother's birthplace"".  Little is known about her father, and Ms Gu uses her mother's surname.  Though her switch to China came in 2019, her Olympic debut has thrown her into the spotlight again.  Speculation about her citizenship status has been rife since Red Bull, a corporate sponsor, claimed she gave up her US passport in order to compete for China, but later removed the line when pressed by a US newspaper. China does not recognise dual citizenship, and Ms Gu has always declined to disclose the status of her nationality. When asked by the South China Morning Post last year, she said: ""I'm fully American and look and speak the way I do. Nobody can deny I'm American. When I go to China, nobody can deny I'm Chinese because I'm fluent in the language and culture and completely identify as such.""  She did not respond to the BBC's requests for an interview.  The Chinese Consulate General in New York told the BBC that Ms Gu would have to have been naturalised or gained permanent residency status in China to compete for its team.  In 2020, the Chinese Ministry of Justice broadened rules for foreigners to obtain permanent residency such that those who has achieved international recognition in sport, science, culture and other fields would be eligible. The expansion would seem to apply to Ms Gu.    Ms Gu and four other athletes went through the process to gain eligibility to play for China in the 2022 Games, the Consulate said.  But regardless of what is stated on her official papers, she faces difficult questions as an athlete born in America, living the life of a Western teenager - yet representing a country whose government has been widely criticised for human rights violations and anti-democratic crackdowns. Ms Gu has expressed support for movements Black Lives Matter and spoken out against anti-Asian violence in the US, but remained silent on issues like the mass internment of ethnic Uyghurs in Xinjiang and the arrests of pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong.  ""There's no need to be divisive,"" she told news site The New York Times. A difficult, if not impossible posture to take when several countries, including the US, are engaged in a diplomatic boycott of the Beijing games in protest at Beijing's human rights record. In China however, she has been embraced by state media. Dubbed ""genius girl skier"" and ""snow princess"" - she has been featured in several government TV documentaries and has also shown her commercial potential by modelling for high-profile brands and her intelligence with a place at Stanford University. Deals with the Bank of China, China Mobile and JD.com, a Chinese retailer, are among her commercial contracts. Ms Gu and her team clearly understand that they must tread lightly.  In declining to speak to The Economist, her American agent, Tom Yaps, told the magazine: ""If [Eileen] participates in an article that has two paragraphs critical of China and human rights, that would put her in jeopardy over there. One thing and a career is ruined."" ""Being a young person, everybody is just figuring out who they are,"" Ms Gu once wrote in an essay for the New York Times. ""You do have to be careful of who you're telling your secrets to."""
geopolitical tensions,Why Western nations fear India-Canada row,2024-09-15,2023-09-19,By James Landale,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66856568,"Western ministers and officials will be working hard to try to ensure the diplomatic row between Canada and India does not bleed into other international relationships.  The last thing the United States and other western powers want now is a row that divides them from India.  On the grand geopolitical chess board, India is a key player.  Not only is it a growing power - the most populous country in the world, the fifth-biggest economy. But it is also seen by the West as a potential bulwark against China.  This was apparent at the recent G20 meeting in India when Ukraine's Western allies agreed a final communique which did not condemn Russia by name for its invasion.  They chose to protect their relationship with India by avoiding a row over the statement, a choice which angered some in Kyiv. The other fear among Western diplomats will be the risk that countries start taking sides in the Canada-India dispute. Tensions between the two nations deepened considerably this week when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accused India of being behind the assassination of a Sikh activist in western Canada in June.  In recent months India has been trying to pitch itself as the leader of developing countries - sometimes called the Global South. Many of these countries have refused to condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  The US and some European countries have been making real diplomatic efforts to win over these countries, telling them the war matters to them and their economy.  Diplomats will not want this row to upset those efforts if it is somehow spun as a North v South battle between two Commonwealth countries, a confrontation between a transatlantic power and a developing nation. Canada's foreign ministry said Mr Trudeau had raised the issue with US President Joe Biden and British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. For now Canada's allies are staying loyal but cautious.  The White House said the US was ""deeply concerned"" about the allegations of the murder, saying it was ""critical that Canada's investigation proceed and the perpetrators be brought to justice"". For countries like the UK and Australia, which both have large Sikh communities, there is always the potential for a diplomatic row like this to have domestic political consequences. UK Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said Britain would ""listen very, very carefully to the serious concerns that have been raised by Canada"".  He told the BBC he had spoken to Canadian Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly about the allegations on Monday, and the UK took ""very seriously the things that Canada are saying"". He refused to say if Britain would suspend trade talks with India - but said the UK would wait until the Canadian investigation was complete before deciding what further action to take. ""Both Canada and India are close friends of the UK, they're Commonwealth partners,"" Mr Cleverly said.  A spokesperson for Australia's foreign ministry said Canberra was ""deeply concerned' by the allegations, and had ""conveyed our concerns at senior levels in India"". So for now, the West will wait and watch as the investigation progresses.  Some allies may be given access to what Canadian intelligence knows. What would change the situation is if firm proof was established.  If that happened, Western powers would have to make a choice between backing Ottawa or New Delhi, a choice between supporting the principle of the rule of law or the hard necessity of realpolitik. In the past, Western nations have condemned alleged extraterritorial assassinations carried out by countries such as Russia or Iran or Saudi Arabia.  They will not want India to join that list."
geopolitical tensions,EU banks on last minute Brexit deal,2024-09-15,2018-09-06,By Katya Adler,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-45428008,"Brussels is in full bustle again after the summer lull and Brexit is back - if not quite at the top - then certainly high up on diplomats' agendas. This autumn is dubbed ""The Final Push"".  By mid-November ""at the latest"", according to the European Commission, a legally-binding withdrawal agreement - by which the UK leaves the EU - and an accompanying, though not legally binding, political declaration outlining how the EU and UK envisage their post-Brexit relationship, have to be signed off by both sides. Considering the painful process Brexit negotiations have been to date, how likely is that to happen? Let me first tell you that that there is a slow but spreading sense of panic EU-wide across business and industry. A no-deal scenario would be costly for Europe as well as for the UK Those dependent on production lines, imports and exports fear the Brexit deal deadline won't be met this autumn thanks to a pernicious cocktail of turbulent UK domestic politics as well as the clashing demands of both sides in negotiations. But step away from the storm and stress of inevitable posturing and business's understandable panicking, and a quiet word with EU politicians leaves you with a rather different impression. ""The EU 27 (member states) have little appetite to make things difficult for the UK this autumn,"" one high level EU diplomat told me. ""They have little appetite for broken relations with the UK. They want a deal.""  Of course. Firstly, because a no-deal scenario would cost European businesses dearly, at least in the short-term as outlined above, and secondly - and even more importantly in the minds of EU politicians - because they look around at the volatile geopolitical situation worldwide and want to keep their UK friends close. The government knows this, which is why you regularly hear government sources insisting that EU countries are on the verge of breaking ranks with the European Commission, because they are supposedly so ""fed up"" with the commission being ""too wedded to EU rules and regulations"". These sources claim that EU leaders will instead now insist on more creative, political solutions (read: Theresa May's Chequers agreement) to bind the EU and the UK together harmoniously after Brexit. A number of these sources suggest the dawn of this EU Brexit epiphany could be in a couple of weeks at an informal summit of EU leaders in Salzburg. Except I'll eat my lederhosen if that actually comes to pass. None of my background chats with European diplomats, politicians and civil servants suggest that this will be the case. Sure, a number of European countries regularly grumble about the European Commission's Michel Barnier, the man tasked with negotiating Brexit on behalf of the EU.  I've heard him described as bossy, controlling and arrogant. Some member states are irritated with his seemingly inflexible stance in Brexit negotiations over specific issues. Luxembourg felt that about financial services, for example. But it would probably take a coup by 10 or more EU countries to overthrow Mr Barnier and most tellingly of all, there are no complaints from the Big Two: Germany and France. Mr Barnier is far from alone in Europe in rejecting large chunks of the Chequers Plan as unworkable. This was already the case before the summer, but as I wrote at the time in this blog, the EU wanted to tread carefully to avoid further damaging Theresa May's authority just as she had finally produced what the EU had long been asking for - a clear British position - and when she was already in such political difficulty at home over Brexit. Europe's summertime whispers have now turned into loud voices. Even German business leaders - the very individuals the government hoped would put pressure on Brussels to bend some rules to accommodate the UK - appealed at the weekend for EU politicians not to give in to the Chequers Plan calling for the UK to remain a member of the single market for goods but not of services or people. Business leaders have agreed with Michel Barnier that ""unravelling"" the single market ""just"" to do business with the UK post-Brexit makes little long-term economic sense. Europeans also have a political argument against what are seen as the ""cherry-picking"" proposals in Chequers. ""If the UK got all those Chequers concessions out of us by leaving the club, I wouldn't like to defend our position to Le Pen of France, Salvini in Italy or Germany's AfD,"" one EU diplomat told me. ""They'd start banging on again about life being better outside the EU. Forget it. We won't do that to ourselves."" Which is why Mr Barnier announced that Brexit negotiations are not centring on Chequers this autumn but rather exploring ""common ground"" between Chequers and EU guidelines. ""In the end this autumn, we just need to scrape through with the completed withdrawal bill and with sketchy outlines of a future relationship that everyone can live with,"" one high-level EU source told me. With UK politics so volatile, no-one in Brussels is 100% sure what these autumn months hold but the guess of the town is that Brexit negotiations will go to the wire. Many here believe that would suit Theresa May. The main sticking point to completing the withdrawal agreement remains the so-called backstop on the Irish border - ensuring that, whatever happens in the EU and UK's future relationship, no new hard border would be built between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.  It's a burning hot political potato for the prime minister, as is finalising a declaration on the EU-UK future relationship - will it herald a United Kingdom that has taken back control or usher in a Brexit in Name Only? With so many political opponents circling back in the UK, Brussels thinks Mrs May might choose to present parliament with a final hour, take-it-or-leave-it-and-face-no-deal-chaos agreement, produced after an all-nighter at a special Brexit summit in November. ""We'll then be happy to say anything that will help her at home,"" one political source here told me. ""We'll say she's the toughest negotiator we've ever come across, if that helps."" In the meantime, as tension and uncertainty mount, the commission worries about keeping jumpier EU governments and businesses from agreeing bilateral so-called no-deal deals with the UK in specific sectors. These are plans to work together bilaterally in the case of a no-deal scenario between the UK and the EU as a whole. This summer may have been a scorcher but the autumn months promise to be far more blistering - in Brexit terms at least.     "
geopolitical tensions,Oil producers stick to their plan despite Ukraine,2024-09-15,2022-03-03,By Sameer Hashmi,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60591107,"Even though oil prices have surged to ten-year highs, a powerful cartel of oil-producing countries say they will only increase their output by a modest amount.  The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, led by Russia, known as Opec+, will not be turning on the taps. The 23-country-strong cartel will add 400,000 barrels of oil per-day to the market from April.  The group is sticking firmly to an agreement signed by its members in 2021 - to continue gradual restoration of output that was halted during the pandemic. Many countries produced fewer barrels of oil during the pandemic as demand dropped sharply during lockdowns. However, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine the global benchmark contract for oil, Brent crude, has surged to $119 a barrel, driven by anxiety over tighter supply.  Opec+ released a statement attributing the recent rise in prices to market volatility caused by ""current geopolitical tensions"" and stated that there was no shortage of supplies in the market. Separately, members of the International Energy Agency (IEA) have also agreed to release more oil on to the market - 60 million barrels - from their strategic petroleum reserves.  Half of that volume is expected to come from the United States. But the emergency move did little to reassure stock and commodity markets with oil prices rising immediately after the decision was announced. Energy market experts believe oil prices will remain high in the near-term.  Markets are likely to remain volatile because major oil and gas companies, including BP and Shell, have announced plans to exit Russian operations and joint ventures.  According to reports, customers of Russian oil are already facing difficulty over payments and shipping after the West's sanctions were imposed, blocking some Russian banks from global payment systems. ""In the short run, we are looking at a pretty serious run-up in prices. All this uncertainty about Russia, the potential threat of physical disruptions is making the markets nervous"" says Ben Cahill, a senior fellow at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.  Traders suggest oil exporters have been offering Russia's highest-quality oil at a discount over the last few days but found few buyers. Russia is the world's third largest producer of oil, behind the United States and Saudi Arabia. It accounts for 8-10% of global oil supply. Europe relies on Russia for nearly 40% of its natural gas. So, given Russia's crucial position in the global energy market, the US and European Union have, so far, stopped short of imposing sanctions on Russia's oil and gas industries. Analysts say the group's decision to stick to its timetable - a gradual increase in production - has not come as a surprise, given its previous reluctance to deviate from steadily ramping-up output.  Key members of Opec+ may fear that adding more supplies to the market at this stage could lead to an oversupply later in the year. A glut would bring down prices sharply.  Energy experts believe that from the cartel's point of view little has changed yet in terms of physical supply on the market. And that prices have risen in direct response to uncertainty over the invasion. However, there have been some noticeable changes, buyers reluctant to purchase from Russia, for instance, are now switching to similar grades of Middle Eastern oil.  ""Opec+ has always based its decisions on what the current data is showing them, rather than what the data will look like in the future due to geopolitical factors"" says Ahmed Mehdi, Analyst, Renaissance Energy Advisors, an energy research house. There may also be another reason Opec+ members are holding back. Negotiations to revive the 2015 Iran nuclear deal are widely expected to come to a head in March. If sanctions on oil-producer, Iran, are eased, then it could unlock Iranian oil exports.  Mr Cahill believes that the deal could put the brakes on the oil rally, and bring down prices. ""The Iran deal is the wildcard: it could break the price momentum"" he says.  US president Joe Biden's administration, alarmed by rising fuel prices, has been putting pressure on key Opec member states, such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), to turn on the taps, with little success. Russian President Vladimir Putin has also been in touch. During a call with Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan it is thought the two leaders discussed the Opec+ deal and pledged to continue coordination on global energy markets. The response to the Ukraine conflict from the Gulf States has, so far, been muted.  Last week, the UAE, a close ally of the US in the region, abstained during the vote on a draft United Nations Security Council resolution condemning Moscow's actions. Analysts suggest Saudi Arabia and the UAE may be taking a more neutral stance to preserve co-operation with Russia on geopolitical and energy issues."
geopolitical tensions,China rebukes Australia MP's Nazi Germany parallel,2024-09-15,2019-08-08,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-49273989,"China has sharply rebuked an Australian government MP for comparing the West's approach to China to what he called the ""catastrophic"" failure to hold back Nazi Germany. Andrew Hastie, the head of a parliamentary security committee, said on Thursday that Australia was failing to recognise threats posed by China. Beijing said it deplored Mr Hastie's comments and his ""Cold War mentality"". Australian PM Scott Morrison said Mr Hastie was entitled to his own views. Opposition lawmakers said Mr Hastie's ""extreme"" comments would exacerbate recent strains with China. Australia has struggled in recent times to balance its traditional security alliance with the US with its economic reliance on China. In a newspaper opinion piece, Mr Hastie wrote that China was aiming to replace the US as the dominant power in the Pacific region, and that this threatened Australia's sovereignty and democracy. He argued that Australia has failed to sufficiently prepare, comparing the situation to France's military defences during World War Two. ""Like the French, Australia has failed to see how mobile our authoritarian neighbour has become,"" he wrote in the piece published by The Sydney Morning Herald. ""Our next step in safeguarding Australia's future is accepting and adapting to the reality of the geopolitical struggle before us - its origins, its ideas and its implications for the Indo-Pacific region."" China's embassy in Australia denounced Mr Hastie's views as ""detrimental"" to the nations' relationship. ""We strongly deplore the Australian federal MP Andrew Hastie's rhetoric on 'China threat' which lays bare his Cold-War mentality and ideological bias,"" the embassy said. ""History has proven and will continue to prove that China's peaceful development is an opportunity, not a threat to the world."" A former army special forces captain, Mr Hastie chairs Australia's parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security. Mr Morrison did not support or criticise Mr Hastie's views but noted he was ""not a minister"" and was free express opinions as a backbench MP. ""We seek to work closely with [China], in the same way we do everyone in the region,"" Mr Morrison told reporters on Thursday. Australia passed new espionage and foreign interference laws last year which were widely interpreted as in part aimed at China. Tensions have also flared over human rights issues and the exclusion of Chinese tech firm Huawei from Australia's 5G network."
geopolitical tensions,Saudi Aramco flotation values oil giant at $1.7tn,2024-09-15,2019-11-17,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50450527,"Saudi Arabia has placed a preliminary valuation on state oil company Aramco of between $1.6tn (£1.22tn) and $1.7tn. The company has published an updated prospectus for its initial public offering (IPO), seeking more than $25bn for the sale of 1.5% of its shares.  That would make it potentially the world's biggest IPO, coming from the world's most profitable company  It is short of the $2tn valuation that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was reportedly keen to achieve. ""The base offer size will be 1.5% of the company's outstanding shares,"" the state-owned energy giant said in a statement that set the price range at 30-32 Saudi riyals per share ($8-$8.5). That could value the IPO at as much as 96bn riyals ($25.60bn) at the top end of the range. If priced at the top end, the deal could just beat the record-breaking $25bn raised by Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba in 2014. Individual retail investors, as well as big institutions, will have a chance to buy shares. Aramco had initially been expected to sell some 5% of its shares on two exchanges, with a first listing of 2% on the kingdom's Tadawul bourse, and then another 3% on an overseas exchange. The firm says there are now no current plans for an international sale, with that long-discussed goal now seemingly being put on ice. Aramco called off a number of so-called roadshows for the shares, aimed at enticing foreign buyers, the Financial Times reported.  European meetings were cancelled on Monday after similar pitches in Asia and the US were dropped at the weekend, the newspaper said. The crown prince is seeking to sell the shares to raise billions of dollars to diversify the Saudi economy away from oil by investing in non-energy industries. Analysts S&P Global Ratings said the stock market debut could enable Saudi Arabia to strengthen its financial position.  ""If subsequently effectively deployed, the funds raised could be used to support longer-term economic growth in Saudi Arabia,"" it said. In its prospectus released last week, the company lists a variety of investment risks ranging from terrorist attacks to geopolitical tensions in a region dominated by Saudi-Iran rivalry. The 600-page prospectus also includes the government's control over oil output as another potential risk. After the flotation, Aramco will not list any more shares for six months, the prospectus says. Although one of the attractions for investors is the potential of high dividends, the document said Aramco has the right to change dividend policy without prior notice. Aramco has hired a host of international banking giants including Citibank, Credit Suisse and HSBC as financial advisers to assess interest in the share sale and set a price. Based on the level of interest. The sale of the company, first mooted four years ago, has been overshadowed by delays and criticism of corporate transparency at Saudi Arabia's crown jewel.  Aramco last year posted $111bn in net profit. In the first nine months of this year, its net profit dropped 18% to $68bn. A third of Aramco's shares - about $8bn worth - will be sold to the man and (the prospectus says) even the divorced woman on the street, giving local Saudi Arabians a stake in their nation's cash cow for the first time.  A TV and billboard advertising campaign, as well as social media, is stoking enthusiasm on the ground and demand is expected to be high.  For the remaining $16bn, the oil giant is turning to institutional investors. And a source close to the company says there has been sufficient interest that they're confident they can cover most of this off within the Gulf.  But there will be disappointment amongst officials if global demand is not there for the jewel in Saudi Arabia's crown.  A fossil fuels company owned by an absolute monarchy in a volatile region are not an easy sell for many Western firms, pursuing the latest trend in investment policy of ""ESG"" (Environmental, Social and Governance) criteria. Norway's sovereign wealth fund is among those to already rule themselves out from investing.  But the promise of sharing the promised annual $75bn cash dividend pot might be too good for some to miss, according to James Bevan, Chief Investment Officer at CCLA Investment Management (one of the UK's largest charity fund managers).  Given his firm's focus, he is not looking to invest in the shares but explains why some are. ""It's a 'risk' in the eyes of some investors to be very underweight in oil and gas, and Aramco may be a means of plugging a sector gap with perhaps less worry than associated with holding Gazprom,"" he says. Investors follow indexes - such as the FTSE 100 - which are made up of array of types of industries and so some feel oil and gas needs to be correspondingly represented in their portfolio. As Aramco's big sales pitch road show kicks off, the real test of investor appetite for the company will begin. "
geopolitical tensions,Economy in north east 'can grow steadily',2024-09-15,2019-11-05,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-north-east-orkney-shetland-50302287,"The economy of the north east of Scotland is expected to grow steadily over the next decade after a ""challenging"" spell, according to a new report. The Aberdeen Economic Policy Panel predicted that the Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire economies would grow by 1.5% annually between 2018 and 2028. It said Aberdeen must continue to diversify away from oil and gas. The report suggests an increasing focus on renewables, culture, and tourism. Among the key findings was that Aberdeen's economy was ""stabilising"" after a ""challenging few years"". The report said: ""These are times of unprecedented political, socio-economic, and environmental change. ""Brexit; geopolitical tensions; trade barriers; demanding new emission reduction targets; a global slowdown - all these factors increase uncertainty and pose economic challenges to countries, regions, and cities. ""Yet despite the turbulence, the Aberdeen City Region's economy remains resilient."" Employment levels of working-age people were said to have increased to 78% in the city and 81% in Aberdeenshire in June this year, up from 70% and 78% respectively three years previously. The report was launched at the State of the Cities Conference held at P&J Live on Tuesday morning. Last month, businessman Sir Ian Wood said Aberdeen would become ""a major global energy city"" not just an oil and gas city. The former chairman of the Wood Group said his ""nightmare"" was that there would be a generation who could not find jobs in the city. Sir Ian told BBC Debate Night he saw ""positive green shoots""."
geopolitical tensions,WTO says Trump's steel tariffs broke trade rules,2024-09-15,2022-12-09,By Natalie Sherman & Jonathan Josephs,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63920063,"The World Trade Organization (WTO) has found that tariffs on steel and aluminium imports that were imposed by the US under former President Donald Trump violate global trade rules. Mr Trump had claimed national security concerns when he announced the new border taxes in 2018, sparking a wave of trade fights around the world.  The WTO rebuffed that argument, saying the duties did not come ""at a time of war or other emergency"". The US said it stood by the tariffs. The US ""strongly rejects"" the ruling and has no intention of removing the measures, assistant US trade representative Adam Hodge said. ""The Biden administration is committed to preserving US national security by ensuring the long-term viability of our steel and aluminium industries,"" he said, adding that the reports ""only reinforce the need to fundamentally reform the WTO dispute settlement system"". ""The United States has held the clear and unequivocal position, for over 70 years, that issues of national security cannot be reviewed in WTO dispute settlement and the WTO has no authority to second guess the ability of a WTO member to respond to a wide range of threats to its security,"" he said. The cases were brought by China, Norway, Switzerland and Turkey.  The WTO said the US should bring its trade policy into compliance. If the country does not abide by the decision, the countries who brought the complaints are entitled, under WTO rules, to impose retaliatory tariffs on the US.  The US can also appeal. That would leave the dispute in limbo, because the US has for years blocked appointments to the WTO's appellate body, which hears appeals, leaving it unable to function. China said in a statement that it hoped the US would respect the ruling and correct its policies ""as soon as possible"", while Switzerland's secretariat for economic affairs said the WTO report had confirmed that countries enjoyed broad discretion to protect security interests ""provided they meet certain minimum requirements"". Norway's ministry of foreign affairs did not respond to a question about next steps. It said in a statement that it had brought the case to try ""to prevent protectionism... so that the rules-based, multilateral trading system is not undermined"". Trade experts said the dispute mattered less for its practical impact than for its implications for the increasingly shaky consensus around how to govern global trade. ""In today's climate with ever-heightening geopolitical tensions, countries are increasingly likely to trigger the national security exception,"" said Chad Bown, global trade expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE).  ""This particular ruling thus has importance not only for members' future policies but also how it impacts their overall support for the WTO system altogether."" Mr Trump imposed the tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminium in 2018, citing unfair competition and national security interests.  The taxes, which have been supported by labour unions representing US steel workers, have already been eased significantly compared to what was first announced, in which even shipments from close allies in North America risked being affected. Mr Trump signed deals with some countries exempting them from the tariffs or admitting their shipments up to a certain level. The Biden administration reached similar agreements with the European Union, Japan and the UK as it tried to smooth relations with allies, but kept the tariffs in full for other countries. Though the tariffs angered allies - and raised concern among US manufacturers that use metals about increased costs - the US said they were aimed primarily at China, which for years has faced concerns from other countries that it has been selling its steel abroad for below market prices thanks to unfair government support. The office of the US trade representative this week sent a proposal to the European Union outlining a new plan to shape the global steel and aluminium market. The aim is to promote trade in metals that are produced in ways that minimise carbon emissions and impose tariffs on metals that are deemed to cause too much pollution. Whilst the details of how such a plan would work haven't yet been published it is likely that China would face taxes in trying to sell metals to countries that sign up. The trade war between the US and China, which was sparked in part by the metals tariffs, has had lasting effects on trade between the world's two largest economies. A high-profile 2020 trade agreement announced by Mr Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping helped to reduce some of the public tension over the issue. But nearly two-thirds of all the goods China sells to the US remain subject to extra taxes, as do roughly 58% of what the US sells to China, according to the PIIE."
geopolitical tensions,Why Taiwanese are among Ukraine's foreign fighters,2024-09-15,2022-12-13,By Sophie Williams,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-63678601,"In a church in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv, Tseng Sheng-guang's mother takes one final look at her son, laid in a casket.  She's joined by other relatives and a number of Ukrainians wishing to pay tribute to a man who died thousands of miles from home, fighting for a country he had never visited before.  ""Sheng-guang my boy, I want you to know that you were very brave,"" she later says. ""You will always be my baby and I'm proud of you."" Mr Tseng was fighting with the International Legion of Ukraine's territorial defence forces when he was killed last month in the eastern city of Lyman. He was the first Taiwanese to die fighting in Ukraine.  In a statement released after his death, Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that Mr Tseng had ""given his life to Ukraine's fight for freedom"".  Thousands of foreign soldiers have travelled to Ukraine to fight and the number of Taiwanese among them is small, estimated at about 10. But Russia's invasion has resonated on the self-ruled island halfway around the world. China claims Taiwan as part of its territory and said it will unify it by force if necessary. Taiwan sees itself as distinct from the mainland. Tensions in the Taiwan Strait increased sharply following the visit of US politician Nancy Pelosi in August, which infuriated Beijing. China responded with military drills around the island. Sammy Lin, who made friends with Mr Tseng online, said Mr Tseng was worried Taiwan could one day suffer the same fate as Ukraine.  ""I remember him telling his friends that he couldn't stand by while the Ukrainian people were being abused and killed by the Russians,"" he said. Mr Tseng was ""one of the most righteous people"" he had come across, Mr Lin said. Taiwan has mandatory military service, which makes those who complete it eligible to join Ukraine's foreign legion.  Jack Yao, 28, was also among those who made the decision to go. He arrived in Ukraine three days after President Volodymyr Zelensky appealed for foreign volunteers to join Ukraine's fight, travelling from Taipei to Poland and then towards the capital Kyiv.  ""I was looking at the situation from last year, especially with the Russians taking a lot of soldiers and tanks to the border with Ukraine. Nobody believed it would happen,"" he told the BBC.  ""The situation with Taiwan and over there is just like us. I was thinking of what I could do to support Ukraine.""  He joined the Georgian Foreign Legion and was tasked with close-combat reconnaissance missions. When he arrived, the Russians were still attempting to take Kyiv.  ""There were a lot of bomb and rocket attacks as the Russians were in Bucha,"" he says, referring to the town north of the capital.  ""I had one mission and I saw our guys killed in an explosion. Almost 50 metres away, the bomb exploded behind them."" During downtime, he was able to discuss Taiwan with members of his unit.  ""One guy had lived in Taiwan for two years and knew the situation. Taiwan and Ukraine are just like brothers. It's 100% the same. They were telling me you can't die here because you have to go back and protect your homeland,"" he said. While Mr Yao has since returned to Taiwan and his coffee business, others remain. In a recent video for a Ukrainian charity, two Taiwanese explained their motives.  ""The main reason we came to Ukraine is to defend Ukrainians' safety,"" they say, while holding a Taiwan flag.  ""We are also afraid that if Russia wins, China will do the same to Taiwan. So we are willing to come to Ukraine to sacrifice our lives and the freedom for the safety of the people here."" Still, not all the Taiwanese who went to Ukraine had geopolitics on their mind. In June, Li Chenling told BBC Chinese he was there because he wanted to live a ""memorable life"".  If Taiwan was invaded, he added, his willingness to fight would depend on the response from Taiwan's government and the US. US President Joe Biden has repeated an assertion that the US would defend Taiwan in the event of an attack by China. However Washington's official policy is one of ""strategic ambiguity"" - it does not commit to defending Taiwan, but also does not rule out the option. Last month Mr Biden said he did not believe a Chinese invasion of Taiwan was imminent. It followed a face-to-face meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping ahead of the G20 summit in Bali.  The Taiwanese general public's views on the likelihood of conflict are mixed, says Paul Huang from the Taiwan Public Opinion Forum.  ""Interestingly, more people seem to indicate that they are not worried,"" he told the BBC.  ""As we have seen from Ukraine, how much people are worried about a certain event has no bearing on the likelihood of that event happening, nor does it say anything about preparedness,"" he added.   However most Taiwanese did not think the island would be able to hold out against China for as long as Ukraine has against Russia, he said. As she grieved, Mr Tseng's mother said her son's decision to fight alongside others for Ukraine had given her a measure of comfort.  ""Knowing that, in the last moments of his life, Sheng-guang was fighting alongside a group of the bravest warriors, that they supported each other and were together in life and death, though I am pained, I find a lot of consolation,"" she said."
geopolitical tensions,"The man the US deported, who then helped China into space",2024-09-15,2020-10-27,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/stories-54695598,"A Chinese scientist helped not one but two superpowers reach the moon, writes Kavita Puri, but his story is remembered in only one of them. In Shanghai there is an entire museum containing 70,000 artefacts dedicated to one man, ""the people's scientist"" Qian Xuesen. Qian is the father of China's missile and space programme. His research helped develop the rockets that fired China's first satellite into space, and missiles that became part of its nuclear arsenal, and he is revered as a national hero. But in another superpower, where he studied and worked for more than a decade, his significant contributions are rarely remembered at all. Qian was born in 1911, as China's last imperial dynasty was about to be replaced by a republic. His parents were both well-educated and his father, after working in Japan, established China's national education system. It was evident from an early age that Qian was gifted, and he eventually graduated top of his class at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, winning a rare scholarship to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the US. In 1935 a trim, well-dressed young man arrived in Boston. Qian may have experienced some xenophobia and racism, says Chris Jespersen, professor of history at the University of North Georgia. But there was ""also a sentiment of hope and belief that China [was] changing in fundamentally significant ways"", and he would certainly have been among people who respected his knowledge. From MIT Qian moved to the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), to study under one of the most influential aeronautical engineers of the day, the Hungarian émigré, Theodore von Karman. There Qian shared an office with another prominent scientist, Frank Malina, who was a key member of a small group of innovators known as the Suicide Squad.  The group had earned this nickname because of their attempts to build a rocket on campus, and because some of their experiments with volatile chemicals went badly wrong, says Fraser Macdonald, author of Escape from Earth: A Secret History of the Space Rocket. Though he adds that no-one died.  One day Qian got drawn into a discussion of a complicated mathematical problem with Malina and other members of the group and before long he was an integral part of it, producing seminal research into rocket propulsion. At the time, rocket science was the ""stuff of cranks and fantasists,"" Macdonald says. ""No-one is taking it seriously - no mathematically inclined engineer would risk their reputation by saying this is the future."" But that quickly changed with the start of World War II. The Suicide Squad caught the attention of the US military, which paid for research into jet-assisted take-off, where boosters were attached to the wings of aircraft to enable them to get airborne from short runways. Military funding also helped establish the Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL) in 1943, under the directorship of Theodore von Karman. Qian, along with Frank Malina, was at the heart of the project.  Qian was a Chinese citizen, but the Republic of China was an ally of the US, so there was ""no massive suspicion about a Chinese scientist at the heart of American space endeavour"", says Fraser Macdonald. Qian was given security clearance to work on classified weapons research, and even served on the US government's Science Advisory Board.  By the end of the war he was one of the world's foremost experts on jet propulsion, and was sent with Theodore von Karman on an extraordinary mission to Germany, holding the temporary rank of lieutenant colonel. Their goal was to interview Nazi engineers, including Wernher von Braun, Germany's leading rocket scientist; America wanted to find out exactly what the Germans knew. But by the end of the decade Qian's glittering career in the US came to a sudden halt, and his life there began to unravel. In China, Chairman Mao declared the creation of the communist People's Republic in 1949, and quickly the Chinese came to be seen in the US as ""the evil ones"", says Chris Jespersen. ""So we go through these periods in the US where we are infatuated with China, then something happens and we revile China,"" he says. Meanwhile, a new director at the JPL came to believe there was a spy ring at the lab, and shared his suspicions about some members of staff with the FBI. ""I note that they are all either Chinese or Jewish,"" says Fraser Macdonald. The Cold War was under way, and the anti-communist witch-hunts of the McCarthy era were just around the corner. It was in this atmosphere that the FBI accused Qian, Frank Malina and others of being communists, and a threat to national security.  The charges against Qian were based on a 1938 document of the US Communist Party that showed he had attended a social gathering that the FBI suspected was a meeting of the Pasadena Communist Party. Although Qian denied being a party member, new research suggests he joined at the same time as Frank Malina in 1938.  But this doesn't necessarily make him a Marxist. To be a communist at this time was a statement of anti-racism, says Fraser Macdonald. The group wanted to highlight the threat of fascism, he says, as well as the horror of racism in the US. They were campaigning, for example, against the segregation of the local Pasadena swimming pool, and used their communist meetings to discuss it. Zuoyue Wang, professor of history at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona, says there is no evidence that Qian ever spied for China or was an intelligence agent when he was in the US. He was, however, stripped of his security clearance and put under house arrest. Caltech colleagues, including Theodore von Karman, wrote to the government pleading Qian's innocence, but in vain. In 1955, when Qian had spent five years under house arrest, President Eisenhower took the decision to deport him to China. The scientist left by boat with his wife and two US-born children, telling waiting reporters he would never step foot in America again. He kept his promise.  ""He was one of the most prominent scientists in America. He had contributed so much and could have contributed much more. So it's not just humiliation but also a sense of betrayal,"" says the journalist and writer, Tianyu Fang. Qian arrived as a hero in China but was not immediately admitted into the Chinese Communist Party. His record was not impeccable. His wife was the aristocratic daughter of a Nationalist leader, and until Qian's fall from grace he'd been living happily in America - he'd even taken the first steps towards applying for citizenship.  When he finally became a party member in 1958, he embraced it and always tried to remain on the right side of the regime. He survived purges and the Cultural Revolution, and thus was able to pursue an extraordinary career.  When he had arrived in China there was little understanding of rocket science, but 15 years later he oversaw the launch of the first Chinese satellite into space. Over the decades, he trained a new generation of scientists, and his work laid the foundations for China's Lunar Exploration Program. Ironically, the missile programme that Qian helped develop in China resulted in weapons which were then fired back on America. Qian's silkworm missiles were fired at Americans in the 1991 Gulf War, Fraser Macdonald says, and in 2016 against the USS Mason by Huti rebels in Yemen.  ""So there's this odd circularity. The US expelled this expertise, and it has come back to bite them."" In taking a tough line against domestic communism, he suggests, the country deported ""the means by which one of their main communist rivals could develop their own missiles and space programme - an extraordinary geopolitical blunder.""  A former US Secretary of the Navy, Dan Kimball - later head of the rocket propulsion company, Aerojet - once said it was ""the stupidest thing this country ever did"".  Today, there is once again heightened tension between China and the US. This time it's not over ideology but trade, concerns over tech security, and China's failure - as President Donald Trump regards it - to do more to contain Covid-19. While most Americans have no idea about Qian and his role in America's space programme, Tianyu Fang says many Chinese Americans and Chinese students in the US, do know about him, and why he had to leave, and they see the parallels with the present day. ""US China relations have got so much worse they know they could be under the same suspicions as Qian's generation,"" he says. In Fraser Macdonald's view, Qian's story is a warning about what happens when you expel knowledge. ""The whole story of American science is that it is propelled by people coming from outside… but in these conservative times that's a story that becomes harder to celebrate."" The JPL's contribution to the US space programme has, Macdonald believes, been much neglected compared to that of Wernher von Braun and other German scientists, who were taken in secret to the US soon after the visit paid to them by von Karman and Qian. Braun had been a Nazi, and yet his achievements are recognised in a way that those of Qian and others from the JPL are not, Macdonald says. ""The idea that America's first viable space programme was started by homegrown socialists - whether Jewish or Chinese - is not really a story that the US is able to hear about itself,"" he says. Qian's life spanned almost a century. In that time China grew from an economic minnow to a superpower on Earth and in space. Qian was part of that transformation. But his story could have been a great American one too - where talent, wherever it is found, could thrive. Last year, when China made history and landed on the far side of the moon, it did so in the Von Karman crater, named after the aeronautical engineer who was a mentor to Qian. A nod, perhaps, to the fact that American anti-communism helped propel China into space. When Tom Patterson started vomiting during an Egyptian holiday he thought he had food poisoning. He was wrong. In fact he was infected with an antibiotic-resistant superbug and only his wife's determination and a revolutionary new treatment would save him. 'My husband squeezed my hand to say he wanted to live, then I found a way to save him'"
geopolitical tensions,EU 'closest to war' in decades over Russia-Ukraine crisis,2024-09-15,2022-01-17,By Katya Adler,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-60030615,"""Europe is now closer to war than it has been since the break up of former Yugoslavia."" Stark words of warning from the senior EU diplomat I've just been speaking to off the record about current tensions with Moscow, over its huge military build-up on the border with Ukraine. The mood in Brussels is jumpy. There's a real fear that Europe could be spiralling towards its worst security crisis in decades. But angst isn't wholly focused on the prospect of a long, drawn-out ground war with Russia over Ukraine. Few here believe Moscow has the military might, never mind the money, or popular support back home for that. True: the EU warns the Kremlin of ""extreme consequences"" should it take military action in neighbouring Ukraine. Germany's new Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock was in Kyiv and Moscow saying just that on Monday. Sweden moved hundreds of troops over the weekend to its strategically important Gotland island - which lies in the Baltic Sea. And Denmark strengthened its presence in the region a few days before that.  The rising tensions have also re-ignited the debate in both Finland and Sweden as to whether they should now join Nato. But the overarching concern in the West - Washington, Nato, the UK and the EU - is less the possibility of conventional warfare over Ukraine, and far more, that Moscow is seeking to divide and destabilise Europe - shaking up the balance of continental power in the Kremlin's favour. Poland's Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki told me late last year that the West needed to ""wake up from its geopolitical slumber"" regarding Moscow's intentions. Fellow EU countries would say they have now woken up and are smelling very strong coffee. But, as is so often the case when it comes to foreign policy, EU leaders are far from united over which precise course of action to take. Moscow denies - despite the massive build-up of troops on the border with Ukraine - that it's planning a military invasion. But it has issued Nato with a list of security demands. Loudly blaming the alliance for ""undermining regional security"", Vladimir Putin insists, among other things, that Nato bans Ukraine and other former Soviet states from ever becoming members of the organisation. Nato flatly refused and the three summits held over the last week or so, between Russia and Western allies, have failed to find much common ground. What Vladimir Putin plans to do next is unclear. But the West believes the Kremlin has invested too much in its very public manoeuvres over Ukraine to back down now, without something to show for it.   The Biden administration is waiting impatiently for a forceful EU position on possible sanctions, depending on what course of action Moscow takes: a military incursion into Ukraine, cyber attacks, disinformation campaigns or - as is considered most likely - a mish-mash of hybrid attacks. EU optimists predict the bloc will agree a raft of possible sanctions by 24 January, at the next foreign ministers' meeting. But that's far from guaranteed.  A number of EU countries are umming and ahing about the cost of eventual sanctions to their own economies. Brussels normally discusses burden-sharing, but the outcome of those negotiations may well not please everyone. There's also widespread concern in EU countries about gas supplies from Russia. Especially with prices already so high for European households this winter. Washington says it's looking into ways of softening the impact on energy supplies. It wants to hurry the EU into agreeing a firm position on sanctions - knowing all too well that, on foreign policy, approval needs to be unanimous amongst member states. Were post-Brexit relations easier between the UK and EU, you'd expect a lot more shuttle diplomacy right now between London, Berlin and Paris to compare and discuss ideas, maybe agreeing a common course of action.  Brussels diplomats slightly cattily describe the UK government as ""probably too wrapped up in domestic political scandals to have geopolitics top of its in-tray right now"", but they openly admit the UK is fully engaged on the Russia-Ukraine issue within Nato. On Monday, British defence secretary Ben Wallace announced Britain was supplying Ukraine with short-range anti-tank missiles for self-defence. He said a small team of British troops would also provide training. Mr Wallace earlier warned Moscow that there would be ""consequences"" for any Russian aggression towards Ukraine. Britain would ""stand up to bullies"", he said, no matter how far away the conflict. Washington insists there's no time to lose. It says the Kremlin is considering a ""false-flag"" operation ""laying the groundwork to have the option of fabricating a pretext for invasion"" - i.e. blaming Ukraine for an attack that Russian operatives would carry out.  The Kremlin dismissed Washington's assertion as ""unfounded"". But US officials say Moscow is preparing to repeat a pattern seen back in 2014 when it accused Kyiv of abuses before Kremlin-backed forces seized control of Ukraine's southern peninsula of Crimea. The territory has a Russian-speaking majority. It then voted to join Russia in a referendum that Ukraine and the West consider illegal. Thousands then died in the conflict that ensued in eastern Ukraine. The West is bracing for what might follow now."
geopolitical tensions,Vladimir Putin: 20 years in 20 photos,2024-09-15,2019-12-14,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-50729110,"Vladimir Putin is about to mark 20 years of leading his country as president and prime minister, navigating geopolitical crises and major sporting events. Bill Clinton was in the White House when the former KGB agent first became Russia's president on 31 December 1999. In the 20 years since, there have been three more US presidents and five UK prime ministers.  From global conflicts and domestic scandals to sporting triumphs and propaganda photos, we look at the images that define Mr Putin's two decades in power. The former KGB officer had already been appointed prime minister when Russia launched the second Chechen war in October 1999, in response to a series of deadly bombings on apartment blocks.  The start of his presidency was shaped by the conflict in Russia's restive southern republic. Russian forces besieged the Chechen capital, Grozny. In 2003, the UN described Grozny as the most destroyed city on Earth in the wake of the siege. For years Russia was hit by militants attacks such as the 2004 Beslan school siege in which 330 people died, most of them children. President Putin did not officially end combat missions in Chechnya until 2009.  Mr Putin was confirmed in office in presidential elections in March 2000, and within months was at the centre of a PR crisis. The Kursk submarine disaster left 118 crew members dead.  When the Kursk sank in August 2000, it took days for Russia to inform relatives and the president initially did not return home from his Black Sea holiday.  In his first decade in office, Vladimir Putin was on generally good terms with Western leaders despite his criticism of their foreign policy,  Russia hosted its first G8 summit in 2006, confirming its membership of the economic group.  Under Russia's constitution, Mr Putin could not stay on as president for a third consecutive term, so in 2008 became prime minister for four years.  Few saw President Dmitry Medvedev as anything more than a Putin protege standing in for his boss. When Georgia sent its forces to regain control of the breakaway region of South Ossetia in 2008, Russia invaded deep into Georgia.  The brief, August war was an alarm call to the West, but it was Russia's move into eastern Ukraine in 2014 that turned Mr Putin's relations with Western leaders sour.  Russia's seizure and annexation of Crimea from Ukraine prompted EU and US sanctions and brought a suspension of its membership of the G8. Four years into the Syrian civil war, Russia intervened to back its ally, President Bashar al-Assad, whose government was on the brink of collapse. Mr Putin's decision to send in Russian planes and armour changed the balance of power on the ground. After Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential election in 2016, US intelligence services concluded that Russia had interfered in the campaign. And in 2018, the UK accused Russia of poisoning its former military intelligence officer Sergei Skripal in Salisbury. Throughout his time in office the Russian president has sought to control his image and that of his country. A number of photos released by the leader over the years have tried to show him as a strong man. He has also sought to boost Russia's sporting profile by hosting the Winter Olympics in 2014 and the World Cup in 2018.  The Sochi Games were a success but the repercussions of a doping scandal continue to be felt. The World Anti-Doping Agency handed Russia a four year ban from all major sports event last week. A 2015 report said Russia had operated what amounted to a state-sponsored doping programme in track and field athletics. This month it was found to have tampered with laboratory data provided in January. While the 2018 Fifa World Cup was an international success, the doping scandal means Russia will not be able to take part in the next competition, in Qatar in 2022. All photos subject to copyright."
geopolitical tensions,TikTok hits back after Trump threatens US ban,2024-09-15,2020-08-01,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-53622799,"The US general manager of TikTok has said the Chinese-owned video-sharing app is ""here for the long run"", after President Donald Trump said he would ban it in the US. Vanessa Pappas told TikTok users in a video statement that its staff were building ""the safest app"". Mr Trump said he could soon sign an executive order, amid concerns the app could be used to collect Americans' personal data. TikTok denies any Chinese control. The fast-growing app has up to 80 million active monthly users in the US and the ban would be a major blow for the Chinese firm ByteDance which owns it. It was not immediately clear what authority Mr Trump has to ban TikTok, how that ban would be enforced and what legal challenges it would face. Reuters news agency reported on Saturday that ByteDance had agreed to completely divest TikTok's US operations. Previously the Chinese company had sought to keep a minority stake, with Microsoft reportedly in talks to buy the app. But sources quoted by Reuters said ByteDance would exit completely and Microsoft Corp would take over TikTok in the US. The move to ban TikTok comes at a time of heightened tensions between the Trump administration and the Chinese government over a number of issues, including trade disputes and Beijing's handling of the coronavirus outbreak. TikTok's US general manager said the company had heard an ""outpouring of support"" for the app, and thanked the ""millions of Americans"" who used it every day. ""We're not planning on going anywhere,"" she said. Addressing concerns about data security, she said TikTok was behaving responsibly. ""When it comes to safety and security, we're building the safest app, because we know it's the right thing to do,"" she said. ""We're here for the long run, continue to share your voice here and let's stand for TikTok."" The platform has exploded in popularity in recent years, mostly with people under 20. They use the app to share 15-second videos that often involve lip-synching to songs, comedy routines and unusual editing tricks. These videos are then made available to both followers and strangers. By default, all accounts are public, although users can restrict uploads to an approved list of contacts. TikTok also allows private messages to be sent but this facility is limited to ""friends"". The app is reported to have around 800 million active monthly users, most of whom are in the US and India. India has already blocked TikTok as well as other Chinese apps. Australia, which has already banned Huawei and telecom equipment-maker ZTE, is also considering banning TikTok. Analysis by James Clayton, BBC North America technology correspondent Trump's dislike of TikTok goes further than just privacy concerns. In India TikTok was banned after a border skirmish with China - it was caught up in a geopolitical feud. And that's what's happened here, too. Trump's sights are set firmly on China - and this should be seen through that lens. TikTok says that it doesn't keep any data in China and would never give it to China. But, in many ways it doesn't matter what they say, the fact that they are owned by a Chinese's company is guilt enough. Not to be overlooked either is Trump's previous experience with TikTok. Last month users claimed to have scuppered his Tulsa rally after signing up to tickets they had no intention of using. And although there are Republican and conservative voices on TikTok, the profile of users in the US is generally young and liberal/left. It's hard to believe that's not a factor here. US officials and politicians have raised concerns data collected by ByteDance via TikTok may end up being passed to the Chinese government. TikTok operates a similar but separate version of the app in China, known as Douyin. It says all US user data is stored in the US, with a backup in Singapore. This week, TikTok told users and regulators it would observe a high level of transparency, including allowing reviews of its algorithms. ""We are not political, we do not accept political advertising and have no agenda - our only objective is to remain a vibrant, dynamic platform for everyone to enjoy,"" the CEO of TikTok, Kevin Mayer, said in a post this week. ""TikTok has become the latest target, but we are not the enemy."""
geopolitical tensions,EU banks on last minute Brexit deal,2024-09-15,2018-09-06,By Katya Adler,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-45428008,"Brussels is in full bustle again after the summer lull and Brexit is back - if not quite at the top - then certainly high up on diplomats' agendas. This autumn is dubbed ""The Final Push"".  By mid-November ""at the latest"", according to the European Commission, a legally-binding withdrawal agreement - by which the UK leaves the EU - and an accompanying, though not legally binding, political declaration outlining how the EU and UK envisage their post-Brexit relationship, have to be signed off by both sides. Considering the painful process Brexit negotiations have been to date, how likely is that to happen? Let me first tell you that that there is a slow but spreading sense of panic EU-wide across business and industry. A no-deal scenario would be costly for Europe as well as for the UK Those dependent on production lines, imports and exports fear the Brexit deal deadline won't be met this autumn thanks to a pernicious cocktail of turbulent UK domestic politics as well as the clashing demands of both sides in negotiations. But step away from the storm and stress of inevitable posturing and business's understandable panicking, and a quiet word with EU politicians leaves you with a rather different impression. ""The EU 27 (member states) have little appetite to make things difficult for the UK this autumn,"" one high level EU diplomat told me. ""They have little appetite for broken relations with the UK. They want a deal.""  Of course. Firstly, because a no-deal scenario would cost European businesses dearly, at least in the short-term as outlined above, and secondly - and even more importantly in the minds of EU politicians - because they look around at the volatile geopolitical situation worldwide and want to keep their UK friends close. The government knows this, which is why you regularly hear government sources insisting that EU countries are on the verge of breaking ranks with the European Commission, because they are supposedly so ""fed up"" with the commission being ""too wedded to EU rules and regulations"". These sources claim that EU leaders will instead now insist on more creative, political solutions (read: Theresa May's Chequers agreement) to bind the EU and the UK together harmoniously after Brexit. A number of these sources suggest the dawn of this EU Brexit epiphany could be in a couple of weeks at an informal summit of EU leaders in Salzburg. Except I'll eat my lederhosen if that actually comes to pass. None of my background chats with European diplomats, politicians and civil servants suggest that this will be the case. Sure, a number of European countries regularly grumble about the European Commission's Michel Barnier, the man tasked with negotiating Brexit on behalf of the EU.  I've heard him described as bossy, controlling and arrogant. Some member states are irritated with his seemingly inflexible stance in Brexit negotiations over specific issues. Luxembourg felt that about financial services, for example. But it would probably take a coup by 10 or more EU countries to overthrow Mr Barnier and most tellingly of all, there are no complaints from the Big Two: Germany and France. Mr Barnier is far from alone in Europe in rejecting large chunks of the Chequers Plan as unworkable. This was already the case before the summer, but as I wrote at the time in this blog, the EU wanted to tread carefully to avoid further damaging Theresa May's authority just as she had finally produced what the EU had long been asking for - a clear British position - and when she was already in such political difficulty at home over Brexit. Europe's summertime whispers have now turned into loud voices. Even German business leaders - the very individuals the government hoped would put pressure on Brussels to bend some rules to accommodate the UK - appealed at the weekend for EU politicians not to give in to the Chequers Plan calling for the UK to remain a member of the single market for goods but not of services or people. Business leaders have agreed with Michel Barnier that ""unravelling"" the single market ""just"" to do business with the UK post-Brexit makes little long-term economic sense. Europeans also have a political argument against what are seen as the ""cherry-picking"" proposals in Chequers. ""If the UK got all those Chequers concessions out of us by leaving the club, I wouldn't like to defend our position to Le Pen of France, Salvini in Italy or Germany's AfD,"" one EU diplomat told me. ""They'd start banging on again about life being better outside the EU. Forget it. We won't do that to ourselves."" Which is why Mr Barnier announced that Brexit negotiations are not centring on Chequers this autumn but rather exploring ""common ground"" between Chequers and EU guidelines. ""In the end this autumn, we just need to scrape through with the completed withdrawal bill and with sketchy outlines of a future relationship that everyone can live with,"" one high-level EU source told me. With UK politics so volatile, no-one in Brussels is 100% sure what these autumn months hold but the guess of the town is that Brexit negotiations will go to the wire. Many here believe that would suit Theresa May. The main sticking point to completing the withdrawal agreement remains the so-called backstop on the Irish border - ensuring that, whatever happens in the EU and UK's future relationship, no new hard border would be built between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.  It's a burning hot political potato for the prime minister, as is finalising a declaration on the EU-UK future relationship - will it herald a United Kingdom that has taken back control or usher in a Brexit in Name Only? With so many political opponents circling back in the UK, Brussels thinks Mrs May might choose to present parliament with a final hour, take-it-or-leave-it-and-face-no-deal-chaos agreement, produced after an all-nighter at a special Brexit summit in November. ""We'll then be happy to say anything that will help her at home,"" one political source here told me. ""We'll say she's the toughest negotiator we've ever come across, if that helps."" In the meantime, as tension and uncertainty mount, the commission worries about keeping jumpier EU governments and businesses from agreeing bilateral so-called no-deal deals with the UK in specific sectors. These are plans to work together bilaterally in the case of a no-deal scenario between the UK and the EU as a whole. This summer may have been a scorcher but the autumn months promise to be far more blistering - in Brexit terms at least.     "
geopolitical tensions,China halts co-operation with US on key issues,2024-09-15,2022-08-05,By Sam Cabral,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-62438262,"China is halting co-operation with the US in several key areas including climate change, military talks and efforts to combat international crime. The new measures follow a trip to Taiwan by a US congressional delegation led by senior Democrat Nancy Pelosi. China, which also announced it was sanctioning Ms Pelosi and her family, views the visit as a challenge to its claims of sovereignty over Taiwan. The self-ruled island sees itself as distinct from the mainland. The measures were announced by China's foreign ministry on Friday. It said dialogue between US and Chinese defence officials would be cancelled, while co-operation on returning illegal immigrants, climate change, and investigating international crime would be suspended. The two major powers have maintained cordial diplomatic ties on the need to combat climate change in recent years. At last year's climate summit in Glasgow, China vowed to work ""with urgency"" with the US to cut emissions. The countries have also found rare common cause on efforts to fight the trade of illegal drugs such as fentanyl. The decision to halt co-operation was taken because Ms Pelosi visited Taiwan ""in disregard of China's strong opposition and serious representations,"" the Chinese ministry said in a statement. It also accused the US delegation and Ms Pelosi - who is the highest-ranking US politician to travel to the island in 25 years - of ""egregious provocations"". In a message posted on Twitter on Friday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying criticised US foreign policy by comparing it to the police killing of George Floyd, the unarmed black American whose death in 2020 sparked global anti-racism protests. ""We cannot allow the US to take itself as 'world policeman' and treat other countries as George Floyd whom it can bully and strangle at will,"" she wrote. At a news conference later on Friday afternoon, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Ms Pelosi ""had every right"" to go to Taiwan and said China's new measures were ""fundamentally irresponsible"". ""We'll continue our efforts to keep open lines of communications with Beijing, while defending our interests and values,"" she said.  Analysis by John Sudworth, former Beijing correspondent in Washington There can be few clearer examples of just how far, and how fast, the international political landscape is shifting. The statement from Beijing marks a new low point in the defining strategic relationship of our time.  The consensus, just a few years ago, was that an established superpower should build strong trade and investment ties with a newly emerging one. The ideological differences would then fade away.  Instead, while China has indeed become the factory of the world, deeply integrated into global supply chains, it has grown more authoritarian at home and more assertive abroad. A 1997 trip to Taiwan by then US House Speaker Newt Gingrich, for example, was met with little opposition.  The Nancy Pelosi visit has been met with missiles - flown directly over a democracy and the heads of its 24 million people - whose appetite, by the way, for China's vision for unification dwindles ever further the more authoritarian it becomes.  And now, any American citizen worried about the impact of Chinese precursor chemicals - sold into Mexico and then turned into the fentanyl that is fuelling thousands of US deaths - will also feel the impact of these shifting geopolitical plates.  The Chinese statement suspends counter-narcotics co-operation.  China's ""shared future for mankind"" messaging on climate change is similarly put on ice, now seemingly held hostage to the precondition that its claims to Taiwan be recognised.  Nancy Pelosi may have given China the pretext. But this is a shift that was already well under way. The battle over values is front and centre stage once again, and the profound challenges it presents for the existing global order are likely only to increase.  Although the US does not officially recognise Taiwan, it maintains strong relations with the island - which includes selling weapons for Taiwan to defend itself. Ms Pelosi is currently in Japan on the final leg of an Asia tour, and said on Friday that China ""will not isolate Taiwan by preventing us to travel there"". Speaking to the BBC, Taiwan's Foreign Minister Joseph Wu defended the visit which he said would ""raise the profile of Taiwan and... allow the international community to understand that Taiwan is a democracy"". He also condemned the large-scale military exercises that China began around the island on Thursday in response to Ms Pelosi's visit. Beijing is currently holding military drills in the air and seas around the island and these are expected to continue until Sunday. More than 100 warplanes and 10 warships have taken part in the live-fire exercises, with many apparently crossing the unofficial buffer zone between China and Taiwan. At least one ballistic missile has flown directly over the island, according to Chinese state media. Taiwan's foreign ministry has not confirmed or denied whether that is true, but it condemned the ongoing drills as ""highly provocative acts"". US Secretary of State Antony Blinken added on Friday that there was ""no justification for this extreme, disproportionate and escalatory military response"". The White House summoned China's ambassador to Washington, condemning China's escalation as ""irresponsible"".  In a statement, National Security Council strategic communications co-ordinator John Kirby said the White House had made it clear that the US ""is prepared for what Beijing chooses to do. We will not seek and do not want a crisis."""
geopolitical tensions,Pakistan rolls out red carpet for Saudi prince,2024-09-15,2019-02-16,By Abid Hussain,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-47255560,"For a country running out of foreign reserves, facing a yawning current account deficit and fighting to secure its financial future, Pakistan is putting on quite a show for Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler - Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. And it's easy to see why: Prime Minister Imran Khan needs money, and he needs it fast. MBS, as he's known, has come to town promising billions.  But money is just one dimension of a relationship that goes much deeper. The two countries have a nexus of interests. Pakistan was meant to be the first stop on an Asian tour taking in five countries but the crown prince's trips to Indonesia and Malaysia have been postponed. He is still scheduled to visit China and India in what is being seen as a charm offensive by the controversial prince. The last time a Saudi royal visit was marked with this much fanfare was in 2006, when then Saudi ruler King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz toured the nuclear-armed nation. And security is being taken seriously - with Imran Khan making a point of saying that he is personally taking care of the arrangements. The 33-year-old Saudi's tour comes amid heightened tensions in the region, after India blamed Pakistan for the deadliest attack on its security forces in Kashmir in decades. JF-17 Thunder fighter jets escorted MBS's fleet on Sunday evening as it entered Pakistani airspace - with all other flights grounded. The crown prince was greeted by Mr Khan and Pakistan's powerful army chief on a red carpet at a military airport and given a 21-gun salute. Imran Khan then personally drove Mohammed bin Salman to the official residence of the prime minister, where Mr Khan doesn't actually stay but where MBS will for his two-day visit, in a first for a state guest. Hundreds of five-star rooms in Islamabad are believed have been booked out for the 1,000-strong delegation. There are even reports that thousands of pigeons have been caught for a welcome ceremony. Pakistan's higher civilian honour will be conferred on the prince, who Mr Khan has praised for his ""reformist ideas"". The central bank has only $8bn (£6.2bn) left in foreign reserves and faces a balance of payments crisis. Since he was sworn in last August, former star cricketer Imran Khan has been aggressively pursuing help from friendly countries in order to reduce the size of the bailout package that Pakistan is likely to need from the International Monetary Fund, under very strict conditions.  The country is seeking its 13th bailout since the late 1980s and Saudi Arabia has already provided a $6bn loan. The visit of MBS comes soon after Abu Dhabi's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan was in town and the United Arab Emirates has pledged to provide $6bn to support Pakistan's battered economy.  But Saudi Arabia is taking things up a notch - with its media reporting provisional agreements worth $20bn are being signed. The crown jewel is a new $10bn oil refinery in southern port city of Gwadar. Gwadar is the nerve centre of China's $60bn China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. Chinese money is much valued by Pakistan's government but analysts say it comes with strings attached - Chinese workers normally build Chinese projects. There are also concerns about Beijing having too much influence. Funds from the Gulf countries are hence very welcome. While it is easy to see Pakistan as a country which is benefiting from the largesse of its allies at the cost of its sovereignty, the story is not so simple. Saudi Arabia needs Pakistan too.  The crown prince's tour comes at a peculiar time for the kingdom, which is currently facing a global reputational crisis of its own due to the humanitarian catastrophe of its war in Yemen and the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in its Istanbul consulate. Against this backdrop, the current tour can be seen as a charm offensive by MBS, who is seeking to bolster relationships with dependable allies while doling out cash.  And it's important not to forget that Pakistan is very important to the Saudis.  The two countries have a military relationship which goes back decades. When Islam's holiest site in Mecca was attacked by militants four decades ago, it was Pakistani troops who were deployed to eliminate them.  ""There has always been the assumption that Pakistan would be able to provide manpower if Saudi Arabia faced a major security crisis or a major attack,"" says Shashank Joshi, a South Asia expert and defence editor of The Economist magazine. ""Saudi Arabia, like some of the other gulf countries, has lots of cash but not necessarily a particularly strong army. Pakistan has not very much cash but a very strong and powerful army."" He adds that it has long been suspected - but never proven - that the two sides have a longstanding nuclear relationship that Saudi Arabia could draw upon if it one day needed access to the technology - for example if regional rival Iran became a nuclear-armed power. The Saudis have a strong religious influence in mostly Sunni Muslim Pakistan and after the Soviet-Afghan war in the 1980s, they were able to set up a large network of religious seminaries, in part to counter Iran's influence. In fact, a week before MBS's visit to Pakistan, the main avenues of Islamabad were dotted with posters and banners commemorating the 40th anniversary of the Iranian revolution. Since then, those have been replaced with pictures of MBS. The presence of Iran as Pakistan's next door neighbour is another reason why the Saudis want to keep up the relationship. ""Saudi Arabia would like to ensure Pakistan remains closer to Riyadh than it does to Tehran,"" says Mr Joshi. It's true that Pakistan's decision not to heed Saudi Arabia's call to join its war in Yemen four years ago damaged the relationship. But this visit - coming amid a generational shift in the Saudi leadership - ""represents a turning of the page"", says Pakistani newspaper columnist Mosharraf Zaidi.  What makes the timing of this tour even more significant is that it comes at a time when geopolitics in the region are shifting.  Unprecedented talks are taking place to bring an end to the war in Afghanistan - where Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Iran, India and the US all have a stake. The high-level talks have been held in Qatar - the Gulf country with which Saudi Arabia has an ongoing rift - and Saudi officials will want to find out exactly what has been going on from Pakistan's army chiefs, says Shashank Joshi. ""Saudi Arabia will be keen that as the peace process continues that it is factions [of the Taliban that they are close to] who are empowered, rather than those who are close to Iran.""

geopolitical tensions,Soaring energy costs cut deep in Spain,2024-09-15,2021-11-02,By Guy Hedgecoe,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-59087189,"Isabel Medina points at her electricity bill, showing how it has jumped since the summer.  ""My energy bill has increased by about 20% in the last two or three months - that's a lot,"" she says. ""Now, with the winter coming, it's going to increase even more.""  Spain is one of many European countries hit hard by a sudden spike in electricity prices in recent months. A surge in demand as countries emerged from the Covid-19 pandemic has not been matched by supply, sending prices soaring.  But Spain has specific issues that accentuate the problem.  Its relative geographical isolation means Spain has less interconnectivity than many of its European neighbours, and therefore less access to the international grid. Isabel, a single mother of two, is taking action to cut her energy costs before the cold weather begins, by having solar panels installed on the roof of her house in the town of Parla, south of Madrid.  It's an option many Spaniards are turning to as the cost of electricity has soared - by 44% over the last year, according to the National Statistics Institute (INE).   Javier Gonzalo, CEO of solar power installation firm FotoEnergy, says demand for the company's services has increased by 50% since the beginning of September: ""And that's mainly because of the increase in the cost of electricity.""    It is not just access to the international grid that is causing Spain energy problems, says Massimo Maoret, associate professor of strategic management at the IESE business school.  Developments in North Africa are having an impact too. ""Much of Spain's gas comes from Algeria and there are local tensions with Algeria and Morocco as they are renegotiating contracts for the pipelines from Morocco to Spain,"" Prof Maoret said.  Algeria ended a transit deal with its North African neighbour on 1 November, preventing gas from being supplied to Spain via Morocco. However, Spain still receives Algerian gas via the Medgaz pipeline.   ""These geopolitical dynamics are very local but they definitely affect the Spanish market much more than, for instance, other markets,"" said Prof Maoret. Covid-19 hit Spain's economy harder than that of any other EU country, causing GDP to shrink by 10.8% in 2020.  This year, spiralling energy costs are hampering the recovery - the IMF has revised down its forecast for Spanish growth in 2021 to 5.7%.  Some heavy industry firms have started taking drastic measures in the face of the extra costs they are facing.  Basque metal producer Sidenor announced in mid-October that it was halting production in its main factory for at least three weeks, stating that the most recent rises in energy costs ""cause losses and make it impossible to maintain the current rate of production"". Chemical producer Fertiberia has taken similar action.  In Las Águilas market in southern Madrid, food retailers are also feeling the impact of the energy crisis. José Díaz Redondo says his fishmonger stall's electricity bill almost doubled between August and September. The stall is part of the Madrileños franchise and the company has responded by cutting back on its use of refrigeration where possible and also parking some of its haulage fleet.  ""We're thinking about closing four or five of our shops because they can't make a profit,"" he says. ""You reach a point where you can't even pay the salary of the people working in the shops.""  The government of Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez has presented a series of measures aimed at mitigating energy costs for families and businesses.  They include tax cuts and reclaiming some profits from electricity companies. Also, poorer families are protected from having their energy supply cut off. As winter approaches, and almost certainly more energy demand with it, such measures will be put to the test."
geopolitical tensions,"If 2017 was 'cyber-geddon', what will 2018 bring?",2024-09-15,2017-12-30,By Gordon Corera,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-42338716,"Scenarios once the province of thriller writers are now anything but fiction in the world of cyber-security. That is the lesson of the past year.  It's a process one British official describes as ""Hollywoodisation"". And if 2017 was notable for the escalation and the proliferation of cyber-attacks, it's left everyone asking what will happen in 2018? The so-called WannaCry attack in May was perhaps the best example.  The idea that we could see hackers - perhaps linked to Russia -  steal code from America's National Security Agency, publish it, and then have North Korean hackers repurpose it before using it to take down a significant part of Britain's National Health Service, would previously have been dismissed as fantasy.  And yet that is exactly what many people think happened.  The best guess is in this case, the attack was actually a money-making scheme gone wrong, which spread far faster than expected.  But it showed how ransomware - locking a machine - could be used as a weapon, and just how vulnerable many parts of our society are to this threat.  The fear for the future is that more high-end attack tools could be stolen, shared and made use of. The other high-profile attack came the following month.  Widely dubbed ""NotPetya"", it hijacked the update service of a Ukrainian tax software firm that had to be used by everyone doing business in the country, and then spread through the company's networks, again locking computers with ransomware.  The aim here was to disrupt, rather than make money, since the key to decrypt the files was not even accessible.  ""This was fake crime,"" says Sean Kanuck, a former US official now with the International Institute for Strategic Studies.  It soon became clear that any company with a subsidiary or an office linked to Ukraine could be hit, and the attack spread far and wide, with estimates of corporate losses running into the hundreds of millions of dollars.  This was widely interpreted as a Russian attack, and only the latest on Ukraine, after hackers had previously taken a power station offline.  ""They have this ransomware facade, which allows them to say, 'This is criminal and nothing to do with us,'"" says John Hultquist of the cyber-security company FireEye.  He's been watching Russian activity for over a decade, and has been surprised by what he has seen recently.  ""I would never have expected them to have gone so far,"" he says. Suddenly states are carrying out cyber-attacks with destructive, real-world consequences. It is clear that there is a willingness to escalate and push the boundaries in cyber-attacks.  And no-one has quite worked out yet where this will stop.  In November, the head of Britain's National Cyber Security Centre, Ciaran Martin, warned that Russia had targeted British energy, telecoms and media sectors.  Other breaches have also upped the stakes.  The theft of data belonging to about 150 million people from the company Equifax was less novel than other attacks but still significant - partly because it revealed just how much personal data could be held by one company without the public ever really understanding how it got there.  Sean Kanuck also points to the hacking of America's Security and Exchange Commission as another major event, because of the possibility of using information for insider trading and market manipulation.  It raises serious questions about the integrity of the financial system. Chinese cyber-intrusions against the US dipped after a deal done by the Obama administration - although an attack against technology service providers called Cloud Hopper and linked to China was under-reported, given the way it was able to leverage access into many other companies.   But other countries have become more visible - a sign of proliferation of capability.  Threat-intelligence companies say they have seen more activity by Iran in particular, and warn that it may be the country to watch.  It was blamed for a hack of the British Parliament this year, which briefly took systems off-line, and there are concerns it too could turn to destructive attacks.  Geopolitics ties in closely to cyber-behaviour.  Worsening tensions with North Korea could lead to it unleashing more activity.  ""The financial sector - particularly stock markets, major companies - and energy infrastructure is where it will try and strike back if possible,"" says Cameron Colquhoun, of Neon Century intelligence. ""It's a classic asymmetric response."" The deteriorating regional situation in the Middle East and the potential end of the Iran nuclear deal could also lead Tehran to do more, and analysts have seen Iranian-linked actors exploring critical infrastructure.  FireEye says it has seen increased activity recently from two different hacking groups linked to Iran (known as APT 33 and 34) with possible reconnaissance of finance, energy and telecoms sectors.  More generally, a number of countries in the Middle East, including Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, may well be more willing to engage in different levels of cyber-attack as they build up their capability. The use of cyber-hacking for political interference has also been a significant development. Information was hacked from the US Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton officials in 2016, but the scandal has only grown since.  And the Macron campaign in France saw similar activity in 2017.  In her Mansion House speech in November, British Prime Minister Theresa May also warned that Russia was ""seeking to weaponise information"", although so far the evidence for Russian interference in the UK is more limited, and Russia has denied all the allegations about interference and cyber-hacking.  And in December Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov clashed in Moscow over alleged Russian cyber attacks against Western countries. The issue of political interference has also marked a shift in understanding that cyber is not just about cyber.  In the case of America, information from the DNC - the Democratic party's governing body - was hacked and then disseminated through a range of channels and pushed across social media.  In other words, the hacking element was only one part of a larger operation.  Approaching cyber-security narrowly risks missing the extent to which Russia in particular has integrated it into a wider range of activities, which often go under the rubric of ""hybrid warfare"".   This is part of a wider trend to use information as a weapon. And it is not just states.  Companies and non-state actors are increasingly seeking to steal data and release it or shape information flows to suit their agendas (or sometimes just to make money by moving markets).  The issue here is manipulating the flow of information, of which ""cyber-security"" is only one aspect. So what next?  The fear is that the trend of escalating destructive attacks - and a proliferation of those able to carry them out - spells trouble.  In particular, there may be greater targeting of critical infrastructure.  In the past, much of this has been pre-positioning of malicious code so that an attack could be carried out in the future, but now we may start to see things such as telecoms, airports and power stations, turned off.  Cyber-attacks are becoming part of foreign policy and defence, and are increasingly being used aggressively and not just discussed in abstract or in the realms of hypothetical scenarios.  With no sign of agreed norms on what is - or is not - acceptable behaviour in cyber-space, get ready for some more surprises in the year ahead."
geopolitical tensions,What the US really wants from the China talks,2024-09-15,2021-03-17,By Barbara Plett Usher,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-56423036,"On the day of Donald Trump's big ""Stop the Steal"" rally outside the White House in January, I spotted a sign that seemed a bit off message: ""China for Biden."" Trump's supporters were focused on his claim of massive election fraud. Just down the road they were poised to begin storming the Capitol Building, demanding that the results be overturned. The white middle-aged woman holding the sign wanted that too, but because ""China is America's biggest threat,"" she told me. ""(Joe) Biden sold us out"" to Beijing and only Trump can ""protect us,"" she said, before segueing into a tale about a new world order dominated by China, shored up by eugenics and dark intentions to merge humans with artificial intelligence. I thought it a remarkable example of how the pandemic, which originated in China, had fed into the thicket of right-wing conspiracy theories that animated the crowd. Despite her concerns about President Biden, though, there is rare bipartisan conviction that China is a unique threat. It's true that Biden was the tip of the spear for Barack Obama's policy of engagement with China, as vice-president investing in a relationship with his then counterpart Xi Jinping. But his ""old friend"" Xi has since become a leader criticised in the US for a brand of personal authoritarianism, and Biden has excoriated his government for ""coercive and unfair"" trade practices. This month the new Secretary of State Antony Blinken described China as ""the only country with the economic, diplomatic, military, and technological power to seriously challenge the stable and open international system."" So a high-level meeting in Alaska on Thursday will be the first chance for the administration to show how it intends to handle what Blinken called ""the biggest geopolitical test of the 21st century."" He and the National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan will sit down with China's most senior foreign policy official, Yang Jiechi, and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi. What do they hope to achieve? This is not being billed as meeting for reaching agreements. It's a meeting for ""straight talk"" to set the ground rules for the relationship. Already the Americans have signalled their approach. The new mantra in Washington is to engage China ""from a position of strength."" First, the face-to-face encounter will be a low-key, one-off affair. Traditionally the secretary of state visits Japan, South Korea and China on his or her big trips to Asia. This week only Tokyo and Seoul were on the itinerary for Blinken's inaugural international foray. China is relegated to a stopover on the way back. And the meeting will be on American soil: that was extremely important, said a senior administration official. The idea is to counter the Chinese perception that the United States is on the decline, says Michael Green, the senior vice-president for Asia and Japan Chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Chinese commentators like to say that the ""winds are blowing to the East."" The financial crisis of 2008, the Capitol Hill riot of 2021 and the years of Trump's unilateralism in between have reinforced a view in China that the US has been weakened inside and out.  ""This meeting in Alaska is geared to show the Chinese are wrong on all three counts,"" says Green. ""The schoolyard version of this is to say: ""You're not so great…yeah you're big, but we like hanging out with our allies, democracies, because they're cool."" Alliances are certainly the bedrock of the strategy. President Biden and his top national security officials deliberately met their counterparts from Asia's major powers - India, Australia, Japan and South Korea - virtually or in person, in the weeks leading up to Alaska.  Another aim is to project inner strength. The ""first order of business,"" said a second senior US official, will be to ""explain domestic priorities"" in terms of combatting the Coronavirus and reviving the Covid-hit economy. The next is also to show that the US - and the administration - is internally unified around the idea that the relationship is a strategic competition. That's why for the first time the secretary of state and national security advisor are meeting their counterparts together. And they can point to pending legislation that's taking shape in the senate as a bipartisan effort to curb China's global influence. What will follow is a long list of concerns, including China's treatment of Uighur Muslims, its quashing of democracy in Hong Kong, its militaristic posture in the South China Sea, and its economic ""misbehaviour."" Areas of potential cooperation are also expected to be raised, such as combatting climate change, ending the war in Afghanistan, containing pandemics, as well as dealing with North Korea's nuclear weapons and Iran's nuclear programme.  ""We want a robust and frank conversation with a power that's a main competitor"" said a third US official. ""We don't want them to be operating under illusions about our tough approach and we want our guys to hear from them."" The Chinese are looking for a reset after relations hit rock bottom under Trump. China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi has said that Beijing is ready to reopen ""constructive dialogue."" But he's also urged Washington to remove Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods, to stop ""suppressing"" the Chinese tech sector, and to stop ""smearing"" the ruling Communist Party. And he's warned the US to stop interfering in Beijing's internal affairs, a reference to policies in Tibet, Xinjiang, Hong Kong and Taiwan that are redlines for the Chinese. The Biden administration has dropped Trump's confrontational and erratic approach but maintained many of his policies, and it is wary about the shift in tone China is seeking. ""We're looking for deeds, not words,"" said the first US official, mentioning an end to ""economic coercion"" against allies such as Australia as a specific demand before the US China relationship could take steps forward. ""But our expectations are realistic,"" she added. ""It's more understanding over time how do we shape that behaviour change that we seek."" One change on the American side is an end to the cold war rhetoric used by top Trump officials, who focused on what they saw as the irredeemable nature of the Chinese Communist Party. But President Biden does continue to frame the relationship in ideological, rather than primarily economic, terms.  ""I believe we are in the midst of an historic and fundamental debate about the future direction of our world"" he wrote in his interim national security strategy, citing the competition between democracy and autocracy. This is a break from the Obama era, but not a complete one. ""I'm sure Blinken wants to give (the Chinese) a message to take back that can be built on,"" says Green. ""Not an olive branch, but a clear picture of what's happening. And the opportunity down the road to work on issues. That's really the biggest difference…that piece Trump would never have done."""
geopolitical tensions,Is China gaining an edge in artificial intelligence?,2024-09-15,2019-11-12,By Natalie Sherman,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50255191,"""China is betting on AI and investing in AI and deploying AI on a scale no other country is doing,"" says Abishur Prakash, a futurist and author of books about the effect of artificial intelligence (AI) on geopolitics. As developments in AI accelerate, some in the US fear that the ability of China's powerful central government to marshal data and pour resources into the field will push it ahead.  The country has announced billions in funding for start-ups, launched programmes to woo researchers from overseas and streamlined its data policies.  It has announced news-reading robots and AI-powered strategy for foreign relations. Perhaps most alarming to the US are its efforts to incorporate it into its military. In the last few years, Washington has toughened oversight of Chinese investments, banned US firms from doing business with certain Chinese companies and increased criminal prosecution of alleged technology theft. ""What the Trump administration is doing is a sign... the US knows that its geopolitical power will be redefined and reconfigured by this era,"" said Mr Prakash, who works at the Toronto-based Center for Innovating the Future. These developments come amid political tension between the two nations. Yet, some analysts worry the US response is counterproductive, arguing that cutting off access to US microchips, for example, could simply accelerate Chinese efforts to develop their own alternatives. The Trump administration has imposed tariffs on billions of dollars worth of Chinese goods - retaliation for ""unfair"" practices it says are aimed at giving China an advantage in the field. The White House has also pressed universities to review their relationships with Chinese partners and threatened to restrict student visas. It is even said to be looking at rules against certain US investments in China - once nearly unthinkable in free-market America. Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power. Read more here. The actions are aimed at preserving US leadership in technologies expected to determine economic and military power for generations to come. ""That China will grow to be an economy as large as ours may be inevitable; that we aid their mercantilist strategy through free trade and open investment in our technology sector is a choice,"" US Department of Defense officials wrote in a widely cited 2018 report. As the US and China race to capitalise on advances in machine learning, facial recognition and other forms of artificial intelligence, Tom Mitchell has a front row seat. The professor of computer science founded the world's first research centre for artificial intelligence at Carnegie Mellon in the US. Since 2018, he has also served as chief scientist at Squirrel, a leading tutoring company in China.  He says the US has more experience building tech companies, but China may have the advantage when it comes to AI applications relying on big data sets - and points to the medical field as an example. ""In the US we've had electronic medical records for over 20 years but we still have not put together all the records in the country to run machine-learning algorithms on those.""  He says the US has been inhibited by privacy concerns, as well as a fractured, for-profit industry.  ""In China, it's a different situation. If the government decides that it's going to have country-wide electronic medical records... then it's going to happen."" Prof Mitchell, who is working on using AI to improve education, says working in both the US and China puts him in the best position to invent and apply cutting-edge technology. But that kind of cross-border collaboration is facing increasing scrutiny, given rising political tensions. Last year, Chinese investment in the US dropped to $4.8bn (£3.7bn) - its lowest level since 2011 - while US investment in China dipped from $14bn to $13bn, according to the Rhodium Group's annual report. High-profile Chinese firms, like insurance giant Anbang and Kai-Fu Lee's Sinovation Ventures, have reportedly sold or scaled back US operations, while China's Huawei and ZTE have suffered serious losses after being subject to US bans.  In US academic circles, universities are rethinking their ties to China, while US firms doing business in China have also grown more cautious. Mr Prakash, who works with start-ups, tech firms and governments on questions of artificial intelligence, says while many western firms continue to pursue opportunities in China, current tensions have changed the discussions. ""Geopolitics is now front and centre for all of them,"" he says. ""They're forced to say, hey, we're based in Silicon Valley, we're selling to part of Asia and now as this tech war unfolds we need to understand what's possible, what can we do, what are our options."" More Technology of Business Prof Mitchell says policymakers need to distinguish between AI applications that are win-win and those that are truly competitive, such as those for the military. In the meantime, he says Washington's increasingly nationalist tone risks alienating America's foreign students and researchers - many of them Chinese - who have played a critical role in US tech leadership to date. ""To start thinking about putting up export control walls around the US could be as damaging to the US research enterprise as anything that a foreign adversary might try to do to us. I hope we will act rationally and not just out of fear."" While US concerns about technology theft have merit, ""I feel like we're over-reacting,"" says Prof Mitchell. ""The fact that China or the UK or anybody decides they want to be a leader in AI - it would be surprising if they did not. It's not something to be reviled,"" he says. American national plans have also called for boosting investment, reforming the immigration system and improving education, but those are much more difficult to achieve, says William Carter, deputy director of technology policy at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""Being hard on China is an easy political sell,"" he says, but warns that, ""I think we're shooting ourselves in the foot in a lot of ways"". The race between the US and China is now moving to other countries, which are being pushed to take sides as tech firms from the two compete for turf.  The US has pressed its allies to stop using equipment from China's Huawei, for example, citing concerns that Beijing could use the firm's equipment for hacking. It has also raised human rights concerns. At a recent conference, a US official argued that Chinese tech companies are ""de facto tools"" of the state's Communist Party, saying they ""have become deeply enmeshed in Beijing's system of oppression at home and its increasingly assertive strategic ambitions globally."" As artificial intelligence technologies drive debates over values like surveillance and privacy, free speech and censorship, conflicts between the two countries are likely to increase, says Nicholas Wright, a fellow at the New America think tank in Washington, who has worked with the US and UK governments. ""To some extent, this is just a generic challenge, where you have a new set of technologies and whomever manages to implement them first and best will gain an advantage... but then there's also another set of issues which is to do with the specifics of these new digital technologies,"" he says. For now, it may take artificial intelligence to know how the race will end. "
geopolitical tensions,Cutting energy prices will take years - power boss,2024-09-15,2022-12-04,By Jonathan Josephs,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63834755,"It ""will take years"" to get energy prices back to pre-Ukraine war levels, the boss of one of the world's biggest energy firms has told the BBC. Enel's Francesco Starace said bringing prices down depends on new sources of energy such as renewables and heat pumps. Governments across Europe are spending billions helping business and households afford energy bills. They are also scrambling to secure new supplies.  Mr Starace said the company, which produces and distributes electricity and gas, tried to shield its 20 million European customers from energy market volatility this year. It did its best to stick to the fixed-price contracts it had agreed, he said. Breaking customer trust would inflict greater damage on the firm than a hit on one year's results, he said. The Italian energy giant sells power to more than 70 million homes and businesses in over 30 countries. But Enel is planning to leave many of those countries as it focuses on renewable energy and becoming carbon neutral by 2040. It also wants to cut its huge debts of around $63bn (£52bn). It is investing heavily in making solar panels as it expands an existing factory in Sicily and builds a new one in the US.  Soaring energy prices have been the biggest contributor to inflation and the cost of living crisis in the UK, the US and the Eurozone. The global energy crisis triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine ""showed very clearly how dependence on one single source of energy is dangerous for Europe"", Mr Starace said. The future will be ""extremely decarbonised"" and depend on nuclear and renewable energy, he said. However, that shift to renewables also has risks. In July, the International Energy Agency warned that China's dominance of the solar industry creates ""potential challenges that governments need to address"".  Mr Starace said the West has been over-reliant on China for renewables and other goods. ""Some rebalancing needs to be happening because it is unhealthy,"" he said, when asked about geopolitical tensions interfering with energy supplies.  This has helped drive Enel's investment in solar panels, although the expansion of the Sicilian factory will still meet only 10% of Europe's needs, he said. Political leaders have also acknowledged that Europe needs to get its energy from more places. According to the European Council on Foreign Relations, the EU and its member states have signed 56 energy deals with 23 countries this year. Among the latest was a 15-year deal for Germany to get liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Qatar through a contract with ConocoPhillips. Norway is also boosting natural gas production and the world's biggest producer, the US, has been pumping out record amounts. This means the chances of Europe repeating its dependence on Russia with another country are ""quite low"", according to Megan Richards, a former director of energy policy at the European Commission. ""A lot of work has been done"" to replace Russian energy, she added, before warning: ""I think Europe will not be completely domestically independent for a very, very long time, if ever"" even though ""renewables will increase dramatically"".

geopolitical tensions,The friendly match that needed a no-fly zone,2024-09-15,2020-12-15,Mani Djazmi,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/55216193,"Iran's visit to the United States took place two years after their World Cup group-stage win at France 98 Paris, 11 July 1998. On the eve of the World Cup final, in a first-floor room in a building on the Champs-Elysees, an idea for a football friendly was hatched that would lead to death threats, an FBI decoy and the closure of American airspace. That night, a media reception by US Soccer to promote the United States' hosting of the 1999 Women's World Cup was in full swing. As the gentle currents of small talk circulated among suited attendees, two acquaintances were brought face to face. Mehrdad Masoudi was an Iranian coming to the end of his time working as the Canadian Soccer Association's communications director. Hank Steinbrecher was the General-Secretary of US Soccer. In football federations and confederations, very little happens without the signature of the 'GS'. Three weeks earlier, the two men had been in Lyon to watch Iran beat the USA 2-1. This group-stage encounter was one of the most politically charged matches in World Cup history because of the enmity between the nations. Iran had been under US sanctions since 52 diplomats were taken hostage in the American embassy in Tehran in 1979, the year of the Islamic Revolution that toppled the pro-American Iranian monarch, the Shah. But on the day of the match, in a US presidential address, Bill Clinton said he hoped it would be a step towards ""ending the estrangement between our nations"". Meanwhile, before kick-off, the American players were showered with gifts from their opponents.  Irrespective of the result, the match had been a diplomatic triumph and the occasion was still fresh in the minds of Masoudi and Steinbrecher when they met, albeit for contrasting reasons. ""I said, 'Hank, how about repeating that?'"" says Masoudi, who was well connected in Iranian football and wanted to help facilitate another match between the nations. ""Home and away games. Iran to come to the US next year, on the anniversary of this match, and you go to Iran the following year.""  Steinbrecher liked the idea. And he saw another opportunity too. ""The World Cup match with Iran was the worst defeat during my tenure,"" he says. ""We hit the post three times. We didn't suffer from bad soccer, we suffered from bad citizenship during that tournament, so I wanted to make it right. They kicked our ass, let's go kick their ass."" There was also the optimistic hope of somehow bringing Iran and America closer through sport, as so-called ping-pong diplomacy had brought the United States and China closer in the 1970s. With a handshake between Masoudi and Steinbrecher, the ball was rolling. Now they had to defy the political forces arrayed against them, and somehow make it roll up a mountain. ""Fate brought the two teams together to play the France 98 match,"" says Masoudi.  ""This time, one side had to send an invitation to the other, who had to accept, and then both sides had to deal with their governments.""  The first, most sensitive and totally non-negotiable condition set by the Iranians was a waiver that would exempt the delegation from being fingerprinted and photographed on arrival in the United States. ""I have seen 80-year-old grandmothers going through that, I saw my own mother going through that,"" says Masoudi. ""For someone who's not used to it, it feels like they're being treated like a criminal. I said to Hank, you have to talk to the State Department and US immigration to get an exemption."" For Steinbrecher, this was the moment of realisation that an idea bounced around among canapes in Paris would have to negotiate an assault course of problems before coming to fruition in California. ""[It felt like] there was a crisis almost every hour,"" he recalls. ""It ranged from fingerprinting their players to the mullahs saying they're not going to play the match because of alcohol advertising inside the stadium.  ""There were many, many hurdles to jump through and luckily we were naive enough to think we were doing some good for mankind."" Iran and USA players posed for a joint team photo and exchanged gifts before their World Cup meeting. Germany and Yugoslavia went through from their group Originally, the first match was set for the summer of 1999 in Washington DC.  But the symbolism of playing in the city of the White House was too significant for the Iranian government, which did not authorise the team to travel to the United States. Instead, the game was rescheduled for January 2000, at the Pasadena Rose Bowl in Los Angeles, home to more than 500,000 Iranians who have nicknamed it Tehrangeles. It would be the final match in a three-game tour after friendlies against Ecuador and Mexico. But two months out, in November 1999, the fingerprinting issue had become a seemingly insurmountable crisis. Thom Meredith, who was director of events for US Soccer, called Masoudi with the news that an exemption could not be secured.  Instead, the players would be fingerprinted and photographed in a private area of the airport in Chicago. ""I said 'Thom, this is an absolute no-no,'"" recalls Masoudi. ""If I tell Iran they will just cancel the games right now. The contract was signed on this condition and, as an Iranian, I wouldn't even ask this.  ""It would have given the people who didn't want this to happen the excuse to stop the team from travelling."" The solution lay with the US Department of State - effectively America's Foreign Office. It remained intractable, until a mysterious intervention saw the Iranians granted exemption, with just weeks to go. ""I don't know what the chain of command was at that time, but my opinion is that this went very high up [in the US administration],"" says Steinbrecher, who had been so long frustrated by the apparatchiks. ""We got it done, they got it done. But they did not see things through the same prism as our federation. There were not many people in the State Department tasked with international diplomacy through sport.""  However, if Steinbrecher and his colleagues thought they were through the worst, they had reckoned without the complex machinery of the Iranian government, in which the president is not the biggest component. As the new millennium dawned, and just days before Iran were due to fly, the next political crisis was played out in Tehran. Hamid Estili (now Iran's Under-23 coach) poses outside his home after returning from the 1998 World Cup. He scored the opening goal in Iran's 2-1 win over USA Under pressure from his political masters to pull the trip, Iran's reformist president, Mohammad Khatami, told the president of Iran's Football Federation, Mohsen Safaei Farahani, to call it off. ""But Safaei had signed the contract and US Soccer had secured the waiver so Iran was contractually obliged to travel,"" says Masoudi.  ""The games were against quality opposition, and they were making over $200,000 for [playing] three games. Iran had never been paid this much to play friendlies."" Safaei Farahani stood firm. It was decided: the tour would go ahead. At this point, Thom Meredith became a key figure. ""I wasn't the guy who contacted different countries and asked for friendlies,"" says Meredith. ""I was the guy who was told, hey, we're playing the Iranians, figure it out."" Meredith travelled to Frankfurt to meet the Iranian team as it transited en route to the United States. It was there, in the transit lounge, that he came face to face with crises of his own. ""There was an Iranian player who met the team in Germany, where he played,"" remembers Meredith. ""He was leaving his club after this tour and he showed me his apartment key. He said, I need to return my key so I get my deposit back.  ""I'm like, 'what the hell am I going to do?' I wrote on a piece of paper to the head of delegation, 'the United States Soccer Federation and Thomas P. Meredith take no responsibility for this player missing the flight.' ""He signed it, I signed it. It basically said, if he can't get back to where we're standing right now, in the transit zone, it ain't Thom's fault."" The player did make it, but then, just before boarding the flight to Chicago, Meredith was told that nearly half the delegation had flights that had not been paid for. ""It was around 3am in Chicago. Who was I going to call? If I called somebody, what were they going to do? They'd probably hang up on me anyway,"" says Meredith. There was only one answer. He would have to foot the $13,000 bill himself (worth about £14,600 today), and keep the receipt somewhere very safe. ""My company credit card had a $5,000 limit. My personal credit card had a $30,000 limit. So I'm standing there, flipping the imaginary coin, thinking: 'I've got to do this, but am I going to get my money back?'"" He did, as well as an upgrade to Business Class; reward for getting the relieved desk staff out of a serious hole. For a few hours, the Iranian team were in the air, out of reach of destructive phone calls and on their way to America. But when they landed at Chicago's O'Hare airport, what everyone had prayed would not happen, happened. ""At immigration, we had a separate lane because they knew this was a special deal,"" says Meredith. ""The agent started with the first guy, and they brought the ink pad out and said we need a fingerprint and we're going to take your photo. ""Immediately, the head of the Iran delegation said: 'We're going home. We're done. You lied.' ""I said, 'Leave it with me, we've got this.'"" Like a conjurer, Meredith produced a letter from the head of the Chicago Immigration and Naturalisation Service, saying the Iranians were exempted. So Iran's footballers became only the second sporting delegation from the country, after a wrestling squad five years earlier, to set foot on American soil since the 1979 revolution. A fan watches on as USA and Iran meet in Pasadena. The Iran flag he's holding is the one in use before the revolution of 1979 The players' liaison officer was Iranian-American referee, Esfandiar Baharmast. In 1972, he had joined a growing number of Iranian students who moved to the United States. Despite his academic expertise in chemical engineering, football was his passion. After his playing ambitions were ended by a serious knee injury, he became a referee and officiated at the 1998 World Cup. By January 2000, he had become director of referees at US Soccer. But as an Iranian football fan, he was living the dream.  ""I was with the players the entire time,"" he says. ""From the moment they arrived to the day they got on the plane to leave.  ""We took them on tours, we went shopping with them, anything that needed to be done. We went on a tour of Universal Studios, the Golden Gate Bridge and Lombard street in San Fransisco. ""I just wanted to make sure that they enjoyed themselves, and I have to give a lot of credit to both federations. ""Hank Steinbrecher was a real man of the world. He saw the importance of this thing and did everything possible to make their stay comfortable.  ""The games are won and lost, but for me it's about the humanity and to see that game played with peace and friendship made me more proud than anything. The whole idea was that in 90 minutes of football, we can move the relationship between the two countries years ahead."" Now that the Iranians were finally on US soil, a covert security operation swung into action. ""We had people who were undercover, watching and knowing where we were at any given moment, but not in an intrusive manner,"" says Baharmast.  ""If you didn't know they were there, you wouldn't have known who they were."" In their first two games, Iran beat Ecuador 2-1 and lost by the same score to Mexico, both times in front of raucous Iranian-American fans. But as the match against the USA approached, joyous mingling turned into heightened awareness as danger slinked in the shadows. Iran's players training before their 2000 friendly match against USA at the Rose Bowl The Iranians started receiving phone calls to their hotel rooms from a spurious Islamic group. Offers of bribes not to play and threats if they did were made. ""Two days before the match, the Iran coach Mansour Pourheidari said someone had called him and offered him $1m to pull out,"" says Masoudi, who had taken leave from a new job in London to be with the team. A call to Iranian football president Mohsen Safaei Farahani, claiming to be from the highest authority in Iran, threatened to down the delegation's flight home if the match went ahead. ""I was there when he received this call,"" says Masoudi. ""He stood very firm and said: 'The people you claim to represent know where I am. They have my phone number and they can call me directly themselves.'"" One theory, which was taken seriously, was that alcohol sponsorship at the match had offended the religious sensitivities of the threat-makers. The main match sponsor was due to be Anheuser-Busch, the company that brews Budweiser lager. At a meeting on the eve of the match, the US Soccer Federation offered to switch to another sponsor. ""I said, well I know the guys at Anheuser-Busch, I'll make good,"" says then US Soccer General-Secretary, Hank Steinbrecher. ""I'll give them more [advertising] signs another day. Nothing's worth putting yourself at risk for, or this match."" But Safaei Farahani adamantly rejected the offer. ""He said, as a soccer administrator, I know how difficult it is to bring sponsors onboard. The loss of an event is the loss of face for you with sponsors,"" says Masoudi. ""I was translating and I had to hold back tears to finish the sentence."" Steinbrecher recalls: ""You want to talk about moral integrity? He showed me his colours. I have to tell you, he was a solid man."" Iran players, wearing the USA shirts they have swapped, acknowledge the Rose Bowl crowd after their 1-1 draw Nevertheless, steps were taken to protect the Iran players. Roads outside the team hotel were closed, and nobody was allowed to park near the hotel, apart from one vehicle, according to Masoudi. ""To make sure that the team wouldn't be followed to the stadium, the FBI put a decoy bus outside the hotel, with 'Iran' branding,"" he says. The actual team bus was kept out of sight in the hotel's deserted underground car park. The decoy, with fake footballers onboard, left first. As it began its journey, Iran's national team was smuggled out through the kitchen and service lifts.  The Pasadena Rose Bowl had hosted two World Cup finals and the final of the 1984 Olympic football tournament. But it is doubtful any of those occasions had the singular atmosphere of this friendly. In a move that now carries a chilling resonance given what was to come 18 months later on 9/11, the airspace above the stadium was closed in case someone was planning on flying a plane into it. The tailgate parties that are a pre-match fixture of any American sporting event, when food and beer is served from cars, were all still there, but with a twist. ""Instead of steaks and burgers, it was Iranian kebabs,"" says Masoudi.  ""Outside the stadium it looked like a typical NFL occasion. But when you got closer and saw the people and smelled the food, it was clear that this was an American outing organised by Iranians."" One of the 50,181 fans present was Saeed Mousavian, who had travelled to Los Angeles from Colorado. ""How many times do you get to watch your national team play? There was a feeling that this might not happen again,"" he says. ""At that time I had an American girlfriend. She went with me and painted her face with the American and Iranian flags. A blonde girl with the Iranian flag. And I made her wear the Iranian shirt as well. ""After the game they asked one of the American players if he would like to go to Iran and play a friendly. He said, 'We don't need to because we were in Iran today.' ""It was just an awesome atmosphere. Everybody was happy. If the American team made a nice pass or tackle - even when they scored - we were cheering for it.  ""I hated that they scored, but at the same time, it was a nice shot."" It was Iran's up-and-coming winger Mehdi Mahdavikia who struck first. Iran were then pegged back in the second half through midfielder Chris Armas's equaliser. A 1-1 draw was the diplomatic result that couldn't be exploited politically. But it didn't help to thaw relations between Iran and the United States, as so many people had hoped it might, and tension remains between the nations today. ""We were naive,"" says Steinbrecher. ""We thought we were doing some really good things for both countries through our sport. But then again, if you're not going to have a higher calling, you shouldn't be involved."" The return fixture that was mentioned as part of the original plan is still to be played. The USA were invited to a tournament called The Civilisations Cup in January 2001, they to represent the new world and Iran, Egypt and Greece the old. Their appearance fee was unaffordable for the Iranian Football Federation. Still, for its architects, the friendly match that began the new millennium with hope for a better future was not all in vain.  ""I have on my floor a prayer rug which was a gift from the [Iranian] delegation,"" says Thom Meredith. ""It's one of my prized possessions. In fact, if I had a fire in my house, I would probably grab that as one of the things to get out the door.  ""I'm very proud of being a part of it, as a student of history, geopolitics and sport.""

geopolitical tensions,China joins Russia in opposing Nato expansion,2024-09-15,2022-02-04,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-60257080,"China has joined Russia in opposing further Nato expansion as the two countries move closer together in the face of Western pressure. Moscow and Beijing issued a statement showcasing their agreement on a raft of issues during a visit by Russia's Vladimir Putin for the Winter Olympics. Mr Putin claims Western powers are using the Nato defence alliance to undermine Russia. It comes amid tensions over Ukraine, which he denies planning to invade. Some 100,000 Russian troops remain at the border with Ukraine, which is a former Soviet republic. Mr Putin, who has written that Russians and Ukrainians are ""one nation"", has demanded that Ukraine be barred from joining Nato. While the lengthy joint statement did not refer directly to Ukraine, the two countries accused Nato of espousing a Cold War ideology. The talks, which the Kremlin said were ""very warm"", were held ahead of the Games opening ceremony. It was the first time the leaders have met face-to-face since the start of the pandemic. ""Friendship between [Russia and China] has no limits, there are no 'forbidden' areas of cooperation,"" the statement reads. The two countries said they were ""seriously concerned"" about the Aukus security pact between the US, UK and Australia. Announced last year, Aukus will see Australia build nuclear-powered submarines as part of efforts to boost security in the Asia-Pacific region. It is largely seen as an effort to counter China, which has been accused of raising tensions in disputed territories such as the South China Sea. Meanwhile Russia said it supported Beijing's One China policy, which asserts that self-ruled Taiwan is a breakaway province that will eventually be part of China again.  However, Taiwan sees itself as an independent country, with its own constitution and democratically-elected leaders. They had lunch, they had talks then they went off to see a show together - a big show.  Vladimir Putin is the star guest in Beijing for the start of the winter games. Of more significance to this visit is the increased co-operation and shared view of the world that Presidents Xi and Putin are keen to show. Although Ukraine wasn't mentioned it was clearly hinted at when they both said they oppose the enlargement of the Nato alliance.  For China this is a delicate balance. Beijing has relations with Ukraine - political and economic. Any Russia invasion or military attack there could be damaging for President Xi's standing. Amid a growing war of words, the US on Wednesday accused Russia of planning to stage a fake Ukrainian attack that it would use to justify an invasion. Russia denied it was planning to fabricate an attack, and the US did not provide evidence to support the claim. Earlier the US said it was sending more troops to eastern Europe to support Nato allies. Russia said the move was ""destructive"" and showed that its concerns about Nato's eastward expansion were justified."
geopolitical tensions,Cold War 2: The Atlantic flank,2024-09-15,2022-03-12,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-60720696,"Ahoy there. We have a new national shipbuilding strategy. It's not much further down the slipway than the last one. Shipyard skills now get their own taskforce, and there is £206m to find ways of reducing shipping's poor record on emissions. Included in the new strategy is the promise of 150 ships and smaller boats over three decades, and more than £4bn already committed. These are Royal Navy orders, plus boats for the Border Force, lighthouse supply ships, and 38 ferries for Transport Scotland, plus the post-Brexit, export-promoting national flagship. It confirms what we knew about complex Type 26 frigates being built by BAE Systems on the Clyde and less complex Type 31 ones by Babcock at Rosyth in Fife. An order for another five of the Type 26 variety is yet to be finalised, while Poland has joined Indonesia in agreeing to buy the Type 31 design. The intention is to get naval shipbuilding into the top rank of productivity within eight years, and for efficiency to match the best European civil shipyards also by 2030. It has a long way to get there. The next Cal-Mac ferries are to be built in Turkey, with the current order well over double its budget and more than four years late at Ferguson's shipyard in Inverclyde. Royal Navy support ships will have a substantial foreign input. The shipbuilding strategy is part of the ""levelling up"" agenda, a political project as well as an economic one, to emphasise to the north of England and elsewhere that the UK government is spending money to boost industry and employment. It's so important that it requires a ""shipbuilding tsar"" - a title bestowed upon the Defence Secretary, Ben Wallace.                     But seeing this as a boost to the economy and jobs misses an important point. It looks less like an elephant in the room and more like a very angry bear. Russia's invasion of Ukraine and its belligerent growling at Nato are bound to give the Ministry of Defence leverage for much more spending to raise Britain's military defences and readiness for war.  Yet the shipbuilding strategy makes no mention of Russia. And in the new circumstances, calling yourself a ""tsar"" seems a tad inappropriate. The Institute for Fiscal Studies notes that current plans make the Ministry of Defence the only major spending department to see a real terms budget cut in the next three years. It is inevitable that will be reversed, observes director Paul Johnson.  That's while there are many other pressures: with the NHS backlog, and to mitigate the acute pain coming the way of household budgets as inflation picks up pace, with both National Insurance and council tax on the way up. MPs have been asking Boris Johnson about boosting expenditure on defence. He has avoided giving any clear answers. Germany set the pace for a big lift in western defence spending soon after the invasion, with a stunning reversal of both its refusal to supply arms to foreign conflicts, and its arms budget. It is increasing its 50 billion euro annual defence budget by 50%, with a one-off boost of 100 billion. Other countries bordering Ukraine and Russia are also stepping up their defences, with ministers indicating that spending will go up in Denmark, Poland, Sweden and Italy. Britain and the US, already past the target of 2% of national output, are using existing resources to boost their presence on Nato's eastern border. So Vladimir Putin has succeeded where Donald Trump failed - pushing Nato's Europeans into a big uplift in defence expenditure, wary that the return of Trump or someone like him could mean that America's reliability against the Russian threat to its Nato neighbours comes back into doubt. Constanze Stelzenmuller, a German defence expert at the Brookings Institution in Washington, says that historic break with post-war doctrine is politically much easier for the new left-Green alliance in Berlin than it would have been for Angela Merkel. Even without a hot war breaking out, the sequel to Cold War One will require more of lots of hardware, as well as software, including cyber-warfare capacity that was not a feature in the last one. Just one indicator of the prospects for that is the rise in share prices for several of the West's biggest arms manufacturers. To take just four of the international firms that manufacture in Scotland, share prices since the start of the year are up 15% for Raytheon and 49% for France-based Thales. The US giant Lockheed Martin is up 25% and BAE Systems, which has Clyde shipyards and much else besides, is up 33%. So where will extra money be required? The disparity in land forces is striking. Military pundits point to Russian tanks vastly outnumbering those defending Nato's borders. That's not to say the tanks will work, or that they have the same role in modern warfare as the one envisaged in the first Cold War. Air superiority, if it can be established, leave them vulnerable, and Ukrainians seem to be doing a lot of damage with Belfast-made anti-tank missiles among others. Britain's contribution to the eastern defences may see more army spending, and the cost of replacing those anti-tank and other weapons that have been given to the Ukrainian armed forces. The Treasury provides the Ministry of Defence with a flexible fund for that, which flexed up to £4bn per year during the Afghan conflict, but is more often in the hundreds of millions. But if we're looking to Cold War 2 or worse, there is also a need to defend Nato's Atlantic flank, which was Britain's main role after 1945. That returns several Scottish military bases into the front line. Unst in Shetland has regained its listening post at RAF Saxa Vord. After years without maritime surveillance, that has returned to Lossiemouth. Russia has been probing UK airspace with military aircraft, if only to make the unsettling point that it can. An anonymous Royal Navy assessment of its naval fighting capacity, openly available online, sees its larger northern fleet as a mixture. There are ageing Cold War relics, including its one aircraft carrier, which audaciously belched its fumes through the English Channel a few years back. It has some more modern surface ships, but the assessment focuses more concern on Russia's modernised submarine fleet. Partly, that is because it poses a threat to the UK's nuclear-armed submarines, if they can be found out there in the Atlantic. But far more vulnerable are the seabed cables that cross the Atlantic and represent vital infrastructure for Nato members' economies.  Defending those cables has become one of the key tasks of Nato naval strategy. It also has to contend with the vulnerability of hundreds of oil and gas platforms in UK and Norwegian waters, and the pipelines that link them to the land. The Royal Navy has a key role in that.  A recent speech at Rosyth by the new First Sea Lord set out the case for this being a time for the Royal Navy to return to the forefront of Britain's military thinking. ""Having spent the last five years in the operational space and seen what Russia is doing, I say to my Russian counterparts we are watching you and we will match you. ""The Russian Navy itself has gone through a major recapitalisation programme in the last decade and a half. It's upgrading its frigates, its amphibious ships and its submarine force."" The plan is not to match Russia hull for hull, or to match China, which the admiral says is growing its naval force at ""an astonishing rate"", but to ""pack more punch - more lethality"" in the Navy's ability to project force. This is the Royal Navy's moment,says its chief, arguing 11 days before the Ukraine invasion that history feels like it is at an inflection point: ""The geopolitical tectonic plates are moving, as we shift from the large land centric campaigns of the last 20 years. It feels as if we are returning to a maritime era. Our government realises that."" The First Sea Lord will surely have read carefully a scathing assessment of the Royal Navy's many weaknesses, set out by MPs on Westminster's defence committee last December; procurement that goes off course and lessons not learned, a lack of fleet support ships, weapon systems being retired and not replaced, a failure to procure the communications necessary across the fleet, a limited ability to do much without allies, reliance on shipyards that are not fit for purpose, and new, high-end ships stuck in port because their propulsion systems don't work, and which won't be fixed until 2028 at the earliest. ""When ships do get to sea they act like porcupines - well defended herbivores with limited offensive capabilities,"" the MPs concluded. ""This is a result of decisions by successive governments to limit budgets and prioritise defensive capabilities. ""Over the next five years or so, at least until the new classes of surface escorts come on stream, the Royal Navy will be asked to do even more with even less. This is a clear risk, which those beyond these shores can calculate just as readily as we can."" At the Royal United Services Institute in London, Prof Malcolm Chalmers says: ""On the balance of investment, the Ministry of Defence would be well advised to examine very carefully what can be learned from this war in Ukraine: weaknesses to be exploited, strengths where we thought they had weaknesses, and then prioritise how best we deal with Russia. ""The UK will not fight Russia by itself, and it's important to think about how the UK can contribute to Nato."" The professor adds: ""What's happening in Germany is mind-blowing"". While Berlin's military planners are best placed to play the key role in stepping up defences on Nato's eastern land borders, he expects to hear calls in Britain for reversal of the recent decisions to cut army numbers. Yet Cold War 2, and the threat of a shooting war between Nato and Russia, is much more complex still. For years, Russia has been fighting a hybrid war, in which it uses various forms of non-military tactics to undermine its adversaries' capacity to retaliate. Interference in elections, and contributing actively to mistrust of mainstream media are among the more obvious.                                                            Dr Stelzenmuller says this has already gone beyond a second Cold War. That ended with the Ukraine invasion, she says. And fighting is no longer like a war game that can be planned by moving military hardware around the landscape.  ""We are seeing a massive focus on economic power, on weaponizing economic interdependence, in the form of sanctions and export controls,"" she says. It features cyber warfare, at which all sides can, and do, play dirty, and reach into every home and the basic infrastructure of adversaries' way of life, far from the military fronts.  It involves propaganda and disinformation to shape public opinion using methods that did not apply before. She also contrasts Cold War 1 and current hostilities with the ability of Russians to leave their country if they choose, for now. For Russia, that runs the risk of losing its intelligentsia and undermining its economic capacity for innovation. Leaving Russia may soon become much more difficult. The German defence analyst also sees a future confrontation in which the West can be disoriented by its adversaries by what is known as ""forum- and domain-hopping"", moving swiftly from physical to cyber warfare, or attacking in several places at once: a cyber attack in Romania, perhaps, a swift boat naval attack in the Baltic, and a terrorist outrage in Paris, orchestrated on consecutive days. What is also lacking compared with the first Cold War, she adds, is a safety net of treaties and trust-building measures - the infrastructure of de-escalation. These are the means by which warring nations can lower the heat, relieve pressure on civilians and ultimately achieve a ceasefire. Relationships were built up between military commanders on either side of the Cold War, to improve their understanding of each other. At Edinburgh University, Prof John Erickson played a significant role in brokering talks between them. Arms control treaties, which were hard-fought in the 1960s and 1970s, are no longer fit for purpose. Like an old submarine, they're rusting and of little use in a conflict. To Constanze Stelzenmuller, the role of the UK in Nato's military defences is not in doubt. What concerns her, post-Brexit and with her twin perspectives from both Washington and Berlin, is whether Britain can be counted as a politically stable and reliable partner."
geopolitical tensions,China warns US about 'playing with fire' on Taiwan,2024-09-15,2021-11-16,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-59301167,"Chinese President Xi Jinping has used a virtual summit with US counterpart Joe Biden to warn that encouraging Taiwanese independence would be ""playing with fire"". The talks are the most substantial since Mr Biden took office in January. Both sides emphasised the two men's personal relationship and the summit was an attempt to ease tensions. But they could not escape one of the most sensitive topics: the self-ruled island of Taiwan. China sees Taiwan as a breakaway province to be reunified with the mainland one day. The US recognises and has formal ties with China. But it has also pledged to help Taiwan defend itself in the event of an attack. China's state-run Global Times said Mr Xi blamed recent tensions on ""repeated attempts by the Taiwan authorities to look for US support for their independence agenda as well as the intention of some Americans to use Taiwan to contain China"". ""Such moves are extremely dangerous, just like playing with fire. Whoever plays with fire will get burnt,"" it said. The White House said Mr Biden ""strongly opposes unilateral efforts to change the status quo or undermine peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait"". Despite the strong words on Taiwan, the meeting began with both leaders greeting each other warmly, with Mr Xi saying he was happy to see his ""old friend"" Mr Biden.  Mr Biden said the two had ""always communicated with one another very honestly and candidly,"" adding ""we never walk away wondering what the other man is thinking"".  Mr Xi said the two countries needed to improve ""communication"" and face challenges ""together"".  ""Humanity lives in a global village, and we face multiple challenges together. China and the US need to increase communication and co-operation."" said Mr Xi.  The world's two most powerful nations do not see eye-to-eye on a number of issues, and Mr Biden raised US concerns about human rights abuses in Hong Kong and against Uyghurs in the north-west region of Xinjiang. China accuses the US of meddling in its domestic affairs.  On trade, Mr Biden highlighted the ""need to protect American workers and industries from the PRC's [People's Republic of China's] unfair trade and economic practices"". Mr Xi also appeared to have made a strong comment on the issue, with Reuters reporting that he had told Mr Biden that the US needed to stop ""abusing the concept of national security to oppress Chinese companies"". Climate change was also discussed. Last week the two sprung a surprise by issuing a joint declaration to address climate change, at talks in Glasgow, Scotland. This was the third time the two leaders have spoken since Mr Biden's inauguration in January. The talks lasted three-and-a-half hours, longer than expected.  Mr Xi has not left China in nearly two years, since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic.  The China-US relationship is crucial to both parties and the wider world, with Beijing having called repeatedly on the new administration in Washington to improve relations which deteriorated under Mr Biden's predecessor, Donald Trump. Both men are facing domestic concerns, with Mr Biden's poll numbers slumping in the face of inflation, the threat of coronavirus and the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan. Mr Xi is tackling energy shortages and a property crisis.  That this meeting has happened at all between the world's two most powerful leaders tells you that both sides believe that the previous open hostility between Beijing and Washington wasn't working for either of them and was potentially dangerous. Their relationship had become so toxic and so dysfunctional that these video discussions have been, in part, an attempt to ensure that competition between China and the US didn't drift into armed conflict due to a misunderstanding at a global hotspot. On the one hand, we should probably be pretty happy they they're steering away from war before it can happen but, on the other, it is quite something that they have felt the need to do so. In fact, if you see the optics at this conference this is the warmest things have appeared for a long time with Chinese and US leaders. These efforts to make the discussions cordial with waving, talk of ""the global village"" and ""humanity's challenges"" was a far cry from the meltdown in Alaska this March when senior representatives from both administrations ended up sledging one another in public. This does appear to be a genuine attempt at a reset and we should actually expect this to alter global geopolitical relations in a concrete way."
geopolitical tensions,Is China gaining an edge in artificial intelligence?,2024-09-15,2019-11-12,By Natalie Sherman,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50255191,"""China is betting on AI and investing in AI and deploying AI on a scale no other country is doing,"" says Abishur Prakash, a futurist and author of books about the effect of artificial intelligence (AI) on geopolitics. As developments in AI accelerate, some in the US fear that the ability of China's powerful central government to marshal data and pour resources into the field will push it ahead.  The country has announced billions in funding for start-ups, launched programmes to woo researchers from overseas and streamlined its data policies.  It has announced news-reading robots and AI-powered strategy for foreign relations. Perhaps most alarming to the US are its efforts to incorporate it into its military. In the last few years, Washington has toughened oversight of Chinese investments, banned US firms from doing business with certain Chinese companies and increased criminal prosecution of alleged technology theft. ""What the Trump administration is doing is a sign... the US knows that its geopolitical power will be redefined and reconfigured by this era,"" said Mr Prakash, who works at the Toronto-based Center for Innovating the Future. These developments come amid political tension between the two nations. Yet, some analysts worry the US response is counterproductive, arguing that cutting off access to US microchips, for example, could simply accelerate Chinese efforts to develop their own alternatives. The Trump administration has imposed tariffs on billions of dollars worth of Chinese goods - retaliation for ""unfair"" practices it says are aimed at giving China an advantage in the field. The White House has also pressed universities to review their relationships with Chinese partners and threatened to restrict student visas. It is even said to be looking at rules against certain US investments in China - once nearly unthinkable in free-market America. Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power. Read more here. The actions are aimed at preserving US leadership in technologies expected to determine economic and military power for generations to come. ""That China will grow to be an economy as large as ours may be inevitable; that we aid their mercantilist strategy through free trade and open investment in our technology sector is a choice,"" US Department of Defense officials wrote in a widely cited 2018 report. As the US and China race to capitalise on advances in machine learning, facial recognition and other forms of artificial intelligence, Tom Mitchell has a front row seat. The professor of computer science founded the world's first research centre for artificial intelligence at Carnegie Mellon in the US. Since 2018, he has also served as chief scientist at Squirrel, a leading tutoring company in China.  He says the US has more experience building tech companies, but China may have the advantage when it comes to AI applications relying on big data sets - and points to the medical field as an example. ""In the US we've had electronic medical records for over 20 years but we still have not put together all the records in the country to run machine-learning algorithms on those.""  He says the US has been inhibited by privacy concerns, as well as a fractured, for-profit industry.  ""In China, it's a different situation. If the government decides that it's going to have country-wide electronic medical records... then it's going to happen."" Prof Mitchell, who is working on using AI to improve education, says working in both the US and China puts him in the best position to invent and apply cutting-edge technology. But that kind of cross-border collaboration is facing increasing scrutiny, given rising political tensions. Last year, Chinese investment in the US dropped to $4.8bn (£3.7bn) - its lowest level since 2011 - while US investment in China dipped from $14bn to $13bn, according to the Rhodium Group's annual report. High-profile Chinese firms, like insurance giant Anbang and Kai-Fu Lee's Sinovation Ventures, have reportedly sold or scaled back US operations, while China's Huawei and ZTE have suffered serious losses after being subject to US bans.  In US academic circles, universities are rethinking their ties to China, while US firms doing business in China have also grown more cautious. Mr Prakash, who works with start-ups, tech firms and governments on questions of artificial intelligence, says while many western firms continue to pursue opportunities in China, current tensions have changed the discussions. ""Geopolitics is now front and centre for all of them,"" he says. ""They're forced to say, hey, we're based in Silicon Valley, we're selling to part of Asia and now as this tech war unfolds we need to understand what's possible, what can we do, what are our options."" More Technology of Business Prof Mitchell says policymakers need to distinguish between AI applications that are win-win and those that are truly competitive, such as those for the military. In the meantime, he says Washington's increasingly nationalist tone risks alienating America's foreign students and researchers - many of them Chinese - who have played a critical role in US tech leadership to date. ""To start thinking about putting up export control walls around the US could be as damaging to the US research enterprise as anything that a foreign adversary might try to do to us. I hope we will act rationally and not just out of fear."" While US concerns about technology theft have merit, ""I feel like we're over-reacting,"" says Prof Mitchell. ""The fact that China or the UK or anybody decides they want to be a leader in AI - it would be surprising if they did not. It's not something to be reviled,"" he says. American national plans have also called for boosting investment, reforming the immigration system and improving education, but those are much more difficult to achieve, says William Carter, deputy director of technology policy at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""Being hard on China is an easy political sell,"" he says, but warns that, ""I think we're shooting ourselves in the foot in a lot of ways"". The race between the US and China is now moving to other countries, which are being pushed to take sides as tech firms from the two compete for turf.  The US has pressed its allies to stop using equipment from China's Huawei, for example, citing concerns that Beijing could use the firm's equipment for hacking. It has also raised human rights concerns. At a recent conference, a US official argued that Chinese tech companies are ""de facto tools"" of the state's Communist Party, saying they ""have become deeply enmeshed in Beijing's system of oppression at home and its increasingly assertive strategic ambitions globally."" As artificial intelligence technologies drive debates over values like surveillance and privacy, free speech and censorship, conflicts between the two countries are likely to increase, says Nicholas Wright, a fellow at the New America think tank in Washington, who has worked with the US and UK governments. ""To some extent, this is just a generic challenge, where you have a new set of technologies and whomever manages to implement them first and best will gain an advantage... but then there's also another set of issues which is to do with the specifics of these new digital technologies,"" he says. For now, it may take artificial intelligence to know how the race will end. "
geopolitical tensions,I read all those Trump tell-alls. Here's what I learned,2024-09-15,2020-09-11,By Thom Poole,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-53970246,"Hardly a day goes by without another book about the Trump White House - by a devoted former aide or a disgruntled ex-employee. Together, what do they tell us about the man?  ""Has there ever been a presidency like this?"" the author of one of the many, many books about President Donald Trump is asked. ""I assured him there had not,"" was the reply. Trump, the high-profile businessman and reality star who upset the odds to become president, was always going to be a popular literary subject.  And those books keep on coming.  This week alone saw headline-making additions to an already creaking bookcase from veteran journalist Bob Woodward and Trump's ex-lawyer Michael Cohen.  There have been blockbuster works from reporters, family tell-alls and there is a whole industry of pro-Trump books from conservative authors.  But this round-up focuses on works by those who worked with Trump either during the campaign or in the White House.  It is a long cast list: The books are by their very nature partial, and given the accounts often depend on reports of private conversations, we only have the author's word to go on that they took place. Those writing sympathetically have been painted as apologists looking for a way back in, while the critical writers have been accused of holding a grudge. But taken together, what do you get? Whatever the author's final verdict of Trump is, there is a major recurring theme.  ""Donald Trump has a fierce code of loyalty,"" writes Spicer. ""Nothing hurts him deeper than when someone he trusts is disloyal,"" says Lewandowski and Bossie. ""Loyalty was the key factor"" in appointments, Bolton says.  Cohen, in Disloyal, and Comey, in A Higher Loyalty, build their titles around this concept.  Comey's book - part memoir, part leadership study, part expose - hints at the moment Trump reportedly told him ""I need loyalty. I expect loyalty,"" when Comey was FBI director. Comey says he refused. He did not last much longer in his job. In Trump's world loyalty is the currency that decides who survives and who has the ear of the president. Sometimes, it spills into policy. In his account of the Trump administration's dealings with Venezuela, Bolton quotes Trump as saying of opposition leader Juan Guaidó: ""I want him to say he will be extremely loyal to the United States and no one else."" But for most loyalty in Trump's world is a one-way street. As Sims notes in the final chapter of his book: ""I had let my personal relationship to the president blind me to the one unfailing truth that applied to anyone with whom he didn't share a last name: we were all disposable."" A demand for loyalty is partly why several authors compare Trump to a mob boss. At least when Comey and McCabe do it they have some authority, having spent their careers in law enforcement. He got off lightly with that particular comparison. To Anonymous, Trump is like a ""12-year-old in an air traffic control tower"". Comey says his leadership is a ""forest fire"". Omarosa, whose book even by Trump memoir standards takes few prisoners, calls him ""a racist, a bigot and a misogynist"".  In his corner Trump can count on Christie, who says he was ""everything I was - but on jet fuel"". Most memorably of all, Spicer says Trump is ""a unicorn, riding a unicorn over a rainbow"".  There is a very little common ground in the books between what Trump's supporters and his detractors say about his character. To the admiring voices he is a man of charisma, sharp instinct and political skill. To them his unique speaking style - while occasionally exasperating - is a gift. Trump ""knew how to speak to the people"", says Lewandowski and Bossie.  Spicer quotes his father as saying: ""Many candidates say something like, 'I will fight for policies that will create a better economy,' while Trump says 'I'm going to get your job back."" Elsewhere, ""of all the character traits that Trump most liked to tout about himself, the boasts about his 'energy' and 'stamina' were the most undeniably true,"" Sims says, a point others make too and one which goes some way to explain why lethargy is a favourite angle of attack for Trump against his opponents. No one says that there is a radically different side to Trump when the cameras are switched off - Sims says ""there isn't really a private version"" of him.  But there are stories of him letting his guard down, such as, for once, going quiet on election night as news of his win came in (Christie). Others talk about phone calls offering condolences after the deaths of loved ones, his affection for his family or warmth for US military members. In Sanders' telling, Trump meets a soldier while on a Christmas visit to Iraq. ""A member of the US Army told him he re-joined the military because of him, and the president said: 'And I am here because of you.'"" Put it this way - it is only Spicer who talks about unicorns. Omarosa says Trump has a ""total lack of empathy, which is itself a function of extreme narcissism"". McCabe calls him the ""most prolific liar I have ever encountered"". Anonymous describes Trump as ignorant, intellectually lazy and with such a short attention span all but impossible to brief. One adviser in the book says the president's demands fall into three categories - the ""flat-out stupid"", the ""impossible to implement"" and the ""flat-out illegal"". Until we know who the author is, though, there will always be question marks over the book's contents. Less easy to dismiss is Bolton's book, who is the most senior figure yet from the Trump administration to write their memoirs. His role as national security adviser gave him a seat at the table and a say in some of the most important events in the Trump presidency.  In his book Bolton says Trump sought help from Chinese President Xi Jinping to win re-election, by urging China to buy agricultural products from farmers in key states. Later in the book Bolton says Trump ""couldn't tell the difference between his personal interests and the country's interests"". There are several examples of Trump cosying up to authoritarians: Bolton says he had a habit of giving ""personal favours to dictators he liked"", and was easily manipulated by them. He describes a letter from North Korean leader Kim Jong-un as like it had ""been written by Pavlovians who knew exactly how to touch the nerves enhancing Trump's self-esteem"" and at one summit ""not looking forward"" to leaving him alone with Russia's Vladimir Putin. To Sims ""everything was personal to Trump - everything. In international affairs, he believed his personal relationship with foreign leaders was more important than shared interests or geopolitics."" Sims sees Trump as a man of ""extraordinary talents and stunning shortcomings"".  With apologies to the authors, who use their books to also tell of motherhood, their professional achievements, or to quote the founding fathers, it is hard to resist not reducing each to one stand-out anecdote.  In Omarosa it is the moment Trump asks if he can swear-in to office using a copy of the Art of the Deal. She says ""he wanted me to believe he was kidding"". Sanders describes the moment the US president tried to help out North Korea's Kim improve his oral hygiene.  ""As the lunch was starting the president offered Kim a breath mint. 'Tic Tac?' Kim, confused, and probably concerned it was an attempt to poison him, wasn't sure how to respond. The president dramatically blew into the air to reassure Kim it was just a breath mint."" But the capo di tutti capi, the one-anecdote-to-rule-them-all, goes to Sims, who says that a small wooden box with a red button inside can often be found on the president's desk in the Oval Office.  ""If Trump noticed someone glancing at the box... he would pick it up and move it further away from himself. 'Don't worry about that,' he'd say. 'No one wants me to push that button.'"" ""Guests would laugh nervously and the conversation would continue, until several minutes later Trump would suddenly move it closer to him without actually saying anything about it. Then, later in the conversation, out of nowhere, he'd suddenly press the button. Not sure what to do, guests would look at one another with raised eyebrows. Moments later, a steward would enter the room carrying a glass filled with Diet Coke on a silver platter, and Trump would burst out laughing."" Trump is often photographed wearing his tie unusually long, with the tip dipping below his waist line. The reason, according to Christie, is that he believes it makes him looks thinner. As for that famous shock of hair, Sims says he always carried a can of hairspray in his pocket should the presidential coiffure need a touch-up. There is a tanning bed in the White House for the president's use, Omarosa says, who also alleges that an usher was fired as Trump didn't approve of her ""handling"" of it. Elsewhere we read that Trump thinks that November Rain by Guns N' Roses is the ""greatest music video of all time"" (Sanders) and was obsessed with sending a CD of Elton John's Rocket Man to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un (Bolton). Beyond briefing documents and newspapers, the president is not described as a keen book reader. Scaramucci, though, names All Quiet on the Western Front as Trump's favourite, while Lewandowski / Bossie say Swiss psychologist Carl Jung's autobiography is another one liked by the president. For those who worked for Trump but later turned on him, why did you stick with him? For Omarosa it was a matter of loyalty, even, amongst other criticisms, as she felt that as a black woman working in an administration low on diversity she offered political cover. For others there is a sense the loyalty was towards the Republican party, and an agenda, rather than the president himself. Partisanship shouldn't be underestimated. As Sanders puts it, about joining the campaign: ""It was going to be Trump or Hillary - help save the country or let it go to hell."" Bolton says he knew of the ""risks in store"", but felt he could handle it. The two were something of an odd couple - Trump vowed to stop ""endless wars"" yet appointed a man of whom he reportedly said has ""never seen a war he doesn't like"". Bolton's time in the administration saw aggressive policies against Iran, Venezuela and others. His regret is that they weren't aggressive enough.  In the grand tradition of memoirs, errors are acknowledged then the responsibility dodged. The Trump campaign and White House comes across as extraordinarily fratricidal. Most of the books, particularly from Trump staffers, include lengthy attacks on other Trump staffers. Some argue the wrong people in the wrong job explains some of the missteps, rather than the buck stopping with the president. On arriving at the White House, Bolton is warned by then chief of staff John Kelly ""this is a bad place to work, as you will find out"". Spicer and Sanders attack the press. Trump has ""never received anywhere near the appropriate credit from the mainstream media for his successes"", as Spicer says.  There's also a sense of Trump's officials holding back at key moments. Bolton at several points says he considered resigning but in his telling it took a dressing down over collapsed talks with the Taliban that was the final straw.  Both Comey and McCabe describe and regret times they did not stand up to him. Recounting a ""bizarre"" meeting, in which the president asked him who he voted for, McCabe asks himself: ""Should I have been more confrontational? .... Even when it's Donald Trump it is still President Trump. So the reflex, the automatic response I felt from the deepest part of myself, was to be respectful and responsive."" These books aren't the obvious place to find predictions of how November will pan out. Notably lots of them begin with the author being fired or resigning, so they can't claim to have the ear of the White House. You do get a hint or two though. Rallies have a central place in Trump's world, as a source of energy and an instant focus group for him to sharpen his message. That stunning win in 2016 is one he wants to repeat - and one he wants to savour. ""I'd sense the tension I believe nags Trump the most, at least subconsciously: nothing about being president has ever reached the high of becoming president,"" says Sims.  The title and theme of Lewandowski / Bossie's book, Let Trump Be Trump, allude to their portrait of a man who is not going to change, and nor should he, they say, given his success last time.  With Joe Biden still enjoying a lead in the polls, perhaps the best lesson comes from Christie, who Trump defeated on the way to victory in 2016. ""As someone who ran against him, I know this much: underestimate him at your peril."""
geopolitical tensions,What would happen if the UK ditched Huawei?,2024-09-15,2020-05-25,By Leo Kelion,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-52797859,"Huawei's future in the UK is in doubt - again. The consequences could affect how quickly improved internet access is rolled out and how much it will cost. This a time when the country's economy is already in a precarious state because of the coronavirus pandemic. The catalyst for a potential rethink is the US's move to restrict the firm's ability to buy chips, which was justified on ""national security grounds"". On Sunday, the UK's National Security Centre (NCSC) confirmed it was examining what impact this would have on the UK networks that use Huawei's tech. That sounds quite vague. But it potentially paves the way for a government U-turn. In January, the prime minister gave the green light to continued use of the firm's tech in mobile and broadband networks, but said its its market share must be reduced. Now he might appreciate the chance for change of mind. It would help Boris Johnson prevent backbenchers who favour a ban from derailing his forthcoming Telecoms Infrastructure Bill.  Moreover, it offers him a way to defuse tensions with the White House, which has said continued use of Huawei will have a ""dramatic impact on our ability to share [security] information"". Mr Johnson and President Trump may meet next month at a mooted G7 summit. Blocking Huawei could help secure a post-Brexit trade deal, even if it made relations with China trickier. But the company warns there would be consequences. ""More suppliers means greater competition, innovation and network reliability, and crucially ensures consumers have access to the best possible technology,"" Victor Zhang, Huawei's UK chief, told the BBC. ""Removing Huawei would seriously delay 5G, costing the British economy up to £7bn,"" he added, citing a study published last year by Mobile UK, a trade group that represents UK network operators. Part of the reason mobile providers are concerned is that the current version of 5G relies on new equipment being plugged into existing 4G kit from the same vendor. ""A lot of the 4G expansion was software-upgradeable to do 5G when an extra mast antenna was fitted,"" explained Andrew Ferguson, editor-in-chief of the news site ThinkBroadband. So, he added, even if a Huawei ban was limited to the newer technology, networks would still have to rip out and replace some of their older infrastructure as well. ""It's not only a very expensive process for the operators, but it's going to be a time-consuming one as well because they need to get access to all those sites to make the changes,"" added Matthew Howett from Assembly, the consultancy that wrote Mobile UK's report. ""And Huawei has been very innovative at coming up with the smallest and lightest 5G equipment, meaning the operators can sometimes just use a cherry picker to hook it onto existing mast infrastructure. Some of the others' is heavier and bulkier, which can require more in terms of getting planning consent and road closures."" Huawei's major 5G rivals are Nokia and Ericsson - two European firms. The networks claim that having three providers to choose from helps them negotiate lower prices.  In many cases, they want a mix of two suppliers so that if technical problems arise with one they can fall back on the other to provide a reduced service. That doesn't always involve Huawei - O2 for instance picked Nokia and Ericsson to be its primary 5G vendors despite having trialled the Chinese firm's kit. A study commissioned by Huawei last year claimed locking it out would increase a country's 5G investment costs by between 8% and 29% due to reduced competition. And if mobile providers have to spend more, consumers can expect their bills to rise too. But one MP opposed to Huawei's rollout says there are more important considerations. ""There's a free and fair competition element here, there's a security element, there's a data-privacy element, and there's a sort of geopolitics of Chinese influence as well - the influence of the Chinese Communist Party,"" Bob Seely, a member of the foreign affairs committee, told the BBC. ""There shouldn't on principle be high-risk vendors in the communications network."" Huawei denies it uses state subsidies to undercut its rivals, adding that it would never spy on China's behalf or otherwise deliberately compromise its clients. Huawei is also a big player in fixed-line broadband. It currently accounts for about 44% of the equipment used in providing super-fast full-fibre connections directly to homes, office and other buildings, according to UK regulator Ofcom. BT's Openreach division aims to bring that in line with a 35% government target by using more kit from Nokia and the US firm Adtran. But this sidesteps the fact that more properties rely on an alternative set-up in which fibre only reaches roadside cabinets, and the last leg is supplied by a copper-based connection. The reason this is relevant is that tens of thousands of the cabinets involved are Huawei's. ""They connect directly to the core of the network,"" commented Mr Ferguson. ""But replacing those is a complete non-starter unless someone's going to throw many billions of pounds at it and also all the people to do the work.""  While Huawei's opponents would prefer it to be gone altogether, they acknowledge this is impractical in the short term. But Mr Seely suggested that cabinets and other such products should be swapped out for alternatives when they are ""up for replacement"". One thing practically everyone agrees on is that the matter needs to be settled once and for at a time when so much else about the economy is uncertain. ""These procurement decisions can take 18 months to two years to finalise and it takes time to ramp up supply to meet the demand,"" said Mr Howett. ""So this isn't just a question of overnight deciding not to use Huawei - it would take many years to do it properly."""

geopolitical tensions,How will Biden change US foreign policy?,2024-09-15,2020-10-15,By Barbara Plett Usher,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2020-54472696,"The world according to President Trump has been one of ""America First"" nationalism, ditching international agreements that he believed gave the US a raw deal.  It was transactional, disruptive and unilateralist. It was also personal and erratic, shaped by his gut feelings and relationships with leaders, and driven by his Twitter feed.  The world according to Joe Biden is a much more traditional take on America's role and interests, grounded in international institutions established after World War Two, and based on shared western democratic values.  It is one of global alliances in which America leads free nations in combating transnational threats.  What could change under Biden? A few things stand out - the approach to allies, to climate change, and to the Middle East. DEALING WITH ALLIES President Trump has praised autocrats and insulted allies. At the top of Joe Biden's to-do list is repairing strained relationships, especially in Nato, and rejoining global alliances.  A Biden administration would also return to the World Health Organization and seek to lead an international coronavirus response.  Mr Biden's campaign framed this as a major reset to rescue America's damaged image and to rally democracies against what it sees as a rising tide of authoritarianism.  But it might be more style than substance, counters Danielle Pletka of the conservative American Enterprise Institute. She argues that the Trump administration has achieved a lot on the global stage, just with sharp elbows. ""Have we lost friends to go to parties with? You bet,"" she says. ""Nobody wants to go to parties with Donald Trump. Have we lost power and influence on the metrics that actually have mattered for the last 70 years? No."" CLIMATE CHANGE Speaking of substance, Joe Biden says he will make fighting climate change a priority and rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement, which is one of the international accords that Donald Trump dumped.  On this issue the two men are polar opposites. Mr Trump sees tackling global warming as a threat to the economy. He has promoted fossil fuels and rolled back scores of environmental protections and climate regulations.  Mr Biden is promoting an ambitious $2 trillion dollar plan to achieve goals for cutting emissions. He says he would do this by building a clean energy economy, creating millions of jobs in the process. IRAN Joe Biden says he's prepared to rejoin another international accord abandoned by President Trump - the deal that gave Iran sanctions relief in exchange for scaling down its nuclear programme.  The Trump administration withdrew in 2018, saying the arms control agreement was too narrow to cope with the threats posed by Iran, and too weak in its limits on nuclear activity, which expire over time.  It re-imposed sanctions and continues to pile on economic pressure, recently blacklisting almost all of Iran's financial sector. In response Iran has stopped observing some of the restrictions on its nuclear activity.  Mr Biden says this ""maximum pressure"" policy has failed, emphasising that it led to a significant escalation in tensions, that allies have rejected it, and that Iran is now closer to a nuclear weapon than it was when Trump came to office.  He says he will rejoin the nuclear accord if Iran returns to strict compliance - but he wouldn't lift sanctions until then. Mr Biden would then negotiate to address concerns he shares with the president. YEMEN Mr Biden would also end US support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen. The high civilian death toll has built strong opposition to US involvement from the left wing of the party and a growing number of lawmakers in Congress.  Saudi Arabia is President Trump's closest Arab ally, a cornerstone of the anti-Iran alliance. Analysts see Mr Biden stepping back from Mr Trump's largely uncritical embrace of the Gulf monarchy.  ""I do think that on the Middle East, there will be a sea change,"" says Ms Pletka, ""a more pro-Iran policy and a less pro-Saudi policy, for sure."" ARAB-ISRAELI CONFLICT Joe Biden welcomed President Trump's agreement between Israel and the United Arab Emirates. Like the Democratic old guard, Mr Biden is a staunch supporter and long-time defender of Israel - the word occupation is not included in the party's foreign policy platform.  But he is unlikely to adopt the Trump administration's policies towards the occupied West Bank. These include a declaration that Israeli settlements do not violate international law, and tolerance of - if not enthusiasm for - Israeli plans to unilaterally annex parts of the territory. Israel's borders explained in maps The Democratic Party's left wing, which has a much more developed and assertive foreign policy coalition than in previous years, is pushing for greater action on Palestinian rights. ""I think we've had much stronger engagement from Palestinian rights advocates, Palestinian Americans, Arab Americans,"" says Matt Duss, a foreign policy adviser to Mr Biden's one-time rival, Bernie Sanders, ""but also a number of Jewish American groups who understand that ending the occupation is a key issue for United States foreign policy."" So that's something to watch.  Like President Trump, Mr Biden wants to end the forever wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, although he would keep a small troop presence in both to help battle terrorism. Nor would he slash the Pentagon budget or suspend drone strikes, despite pressure from the left. And when it comes to geopolitical adversaries, there may be less of a difference than you'd expect. RUSSIA The relationship at the top would certainly change. President Trump often seemed ready to personally forgive Vladimir Putin for behaviour that violated international norms. But the Trump administration has been pretty tough on Russia, punishing it with sanctions. That would probably continue under a Biden presidency, without the mixed messaging. The former vice-president bluntly told CNN he believed Russia was ""an opponent."" He's promised a forceful response for election interference, and for alleged bounty payments to the Taliban to target American troops in Afghanistan, something Mr Trump hasn't addressed.  At the same time Mr Biden has made clear that he wants to work with Moscow to preserve what's left of the arms control treaties constraining their nuclear arsenals. President Trump has pulled out of two, accusing Russia of cheating, and is trying to negotiate the extension of a third  which expires in February. Biden has committed to extending it without conditions if he's elected.  CHINA In 2017, Mr Trump described how he and Xi Jinping bonded over chocolate cake. But since then MR Trump has traded his friendship with the Chinese president for accusations about spreading the coronavirus, for harsh measures and a new Cold War rhetoric.  In fact there is rare cross-party agreement on getting tough with China over trade and other issues. The question is about tactics.   Mr Biden would continue President Trump's policy of countering China's ""abusive economic practices,"" but jointly with allies, as opposed to Trump's preference for unilateral trade deals.  The sharp elbows of the Trump administration have been successful in winning global support for a boycott of Chinese communications technology. That's part of a serious escalation in US efforts to push back against Beijing on many fronts, which has brought relations to their lowest point in decades.  This campaign is led by Trump's China hawks - strategic competition they call it, but strategic confrontation is how some analysts describe it. Joe Biden would more actively seek areas of cooperation with a rising China. He says he wants to revive American leadership.  But the world has also changed in the past four years, with the robust return of great power competition and recent polls showing America's reputation has plummeted even amongst staunch allies, those Mr Biden would aspire to lead.

geopolitical tensions,"Trade row may hurt global growth, says G20",2024-09-15,2018-07-23,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44919973,"The G20 group of finance ministers has said trade tensions could undermine the global economy.  It called for greater dialogue to reduce the risk after a tense, two-day meeting in Argentina. The summit comes as the US ramped up trade tensions on Friday, saying it was ready to slap tariffs on all $500bn of imports from China. France's finance minister, meanwhile, said the EU should not negotiate trade with ""a gun to its head."" In a joint statement, the G20 ministers said risks to growth ""over the short and medium term have increased. These include rising financial vulnerabilities, heightened trade and geopolitical tensions.""  ""International trade and investment are important engines of growth,"" they said, adding that they ""recognise the need to step up dialogue and actions to mitigate risks and enhance confidence."" The G20 summit comes as a trade war has escalated in recent weeks after the US opened fire on 6 July with tariffs on $34bn of Chinese goods. The US has since listed another $200bn worth of Chinese products to be targeted and has threatened tariffs on an even greater amount. US President Donald Trump also described the EU as a ""foe"" on trade last week. French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire warned that a trade war was now a reality at the G20 summit. He said the current US trade policy of imposing unilateral tariffs was based on ""the law of the jungle"". But US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin defended the tariffs and urged the EU and China to open their markets to allow free competition. The US has large trade deficits with both the 28-member EU and China.  Given the US buys nearly four times as much from China as it sells to them, analysts fear it could seek alternative ways to get back at the US. The two-day summit in Buenos Aires brought together finance ministers and central bankers of the world's top 20 economies. ""World trade cannot base itself on the law of the jungle and the unilateral increase of tariffs is the law of the jungle,"" Mr Le Maire said on Saturday.  ""The law of the fittest - this cannot be the future of global trade relations. The law of the jungle will only turn out losers, it will weaken growth, threaten the most fragile countries and have disastrous political consequences."" He added that a trade war was now a reality, and that the EU could not consider negotiating a free trade deal with the US without America first withdrawing its tariffs on steel and aluminium. Mr Mnuchin said it was pretty simple. ""My message is pretty clear, it's the same message the president delivered at the G7 (last month in Canada): if Europe believes in free trade, we're ready to sign a free trade agreement with no tariffs, no non-tariff barriers and no subsidies. It has to be all three,"" he said. Mr Mnuchin said China had to open its markets ""so we can compete fairly"". Little has caused Donald Trump more annoyance than the trading deficits between the US and its major partners. He believes that if you have a trade deficit - if you import more than you export - you are losing out. Tackling what he has called ""unfair trading practices"" has become a key plank of his administration. The European Union, China and the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) countries, Mexico and Canada, have been his main targets. Mr Trump has pulled out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal and wants a renegotiated Nafta deal. January: The US slaps tariffs on imported washing machines and solar panels June: The Trump administration introduces tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminium imported into the US, arguing that global oversupply, driven by China, threatens American producers. The EU enacts retaliatory tariffs on a range of US goods, including bourbon whiskey, Harley Davidson motorcycles and orange juice July: A 25% tariff affecting $34bn (£25.7bn) of Chinese goods begins. China retaliates in kind, with equivalent tariffs on the same value of US goods. Mr Trump threatens a 10% additional tariff on $200bn worth of additional Chinese products, naming more than 6,000 items"
geopolitical tensions,HSBC boss out in top-level reshuffle,2024-09-15,2019-08-04,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-49230568,"The chief executive of HSBC has stepped down after the bank said it needed a change in leadership to address a ""challenging global environment"". John Flint is giving up the role he has held for a year-and-a-half ""by mutual agreement with the board"". He will immediately cease his day-to-day responsibilities at HSBC, but will help with the transition as Noel Quinn takes over as interim chief executive.  Chairman Mark Tucker thanked Mr Flint for his ""commitment"" and ""dedication"".  However, he said: ""In the increasingly complex and challenging global environment in which the bank operates, the board believes a change is needed to meet the challenges that we face and to capture the very significant opportunities before us."" HSBC made the surprise announcement as it reported a 15.8% rise in pre-tax profit to $12.4bn (£10.2bn) for the six months to 30 June.  Mr Flint, who has worked at HSBC for 30 years, said: ""I have agreed with the board that today's good interim results indicate that this is the right time for change, both for me and the bank.""  The 51-year-old ran the bank's retail and wealth management business before taking over as chief executive last year. At that time, Mr Flint was seen as a safe choice for the top job.  HSBC portrays itself as a conservative bank.  Unlike some rivals, it has never pursued the wilder excesses of investment banking, and has a proud record of appointing its chief executive and chairman from within. It is part of the establishment in Asia and the West, and makes its money from the giant trade flows between. With a 30-year track record at the bank, John Flint appeared the safest of hands when appointed 18 months ago. The bank's shares have fallen during his tenure, but the increasing trade tensions between America and China explain most of the fall. Mr Flint will be a ""good leaver"" - meaning he keeps his entitlement to most of his share options - and which rules out any idea his departure is linked to misconduct.  Mr Flint was regarded as the favourite of his predecessor as chief executive, Stuart Gulliver - so it is possible that Mark Tucker, HSBC's chairman, has simply decided he wants his own man in the job. But the Huawei connection, although not confirmed by HSBC, cannot be discounted. In seeking to keep in the good books of the US authorities - which had a monitor embedded at the bank - HSBC provided the information that allowed America to apply for the extradition of Meng Wanzhou, Huawei's chief financial officer. That cannot have pleased Beijing, and HSBC is reliant on China's goodwill as much as America's. Mr Flint may have been the necessary sacrifice. Commenting on the current environment, HSBC said ""the outlook has changed"".  It said that US interest rates were now expected to fall rather than rise and ""geopolitical issues could impact a significant number of our major markets"". It added: ""In the near term, the nature and impact of the UK's departure from the European Union remain highly uncertain."" Mr Flint has a 12-month notice period, but it is not clear when his departure date will be, because he has ""agreed to remain available to HSBC"". HSBC has also granted Mr Flint ""good leaver"" status, which means he will be entitled to any stock options that vest after he exits the bank, provided he does not work at a competitor for two years.  The bank said it has begun a search to find a new chief executive and ""will be considering internal and external candidates""."
geopolitical tensions,Why South Korea and Japan have fallen out,2024-09-15,2019-08-22,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-49330531,"The ongoing trade and political dispute between South Korea and Japan is tied to lingering wounds dating back more than 100 years. However, as the countries are two of the world's largest economies and giants in technology, the tit-for-tat dispute also has global implications.  At the centre is South Korea's demands that Japan pay what they consider to be appropriate reparations for atrocities committed during the Japanese occupation of the Korean peninsula from 1910 to 1945, particularly the use of forced labour.  But Japan considers the issue to be settled. So what exactly is going on? The two nations share a complicated history. They have fought on and off since at least the 7th Century, and Japan has repeatedly tried to invade the peninsula since then.  In 1910, it annexed Korea, turning the territory into a colony.  By the late 1930s, Japan was starting to mobilise for war. It began to force people to work in the factories and mines, or enlist as soldiers. It also sent tens of thousands of women from across Asia - many of them Korean - into military brothels to service Japanese soldiers. The victims became known as ""comfort women"". Japan's rule of Korea ended in 1945 when it was defeated in the war. But it took another 20 years before South Korean President Park Chung-hee agreed to normalise relations with the country in exchange for hundreds of millions of dollars in loans and grants.  Tokyo argues that the 1965 treaty that restored diplomatic ties and provided more than $800m (£620m) in Japanese financial help, has settled the matter.  However, it remains far from resolved.  Yoo Euy-sang, a diplomat and author of the book Diplomatic Propriety & Our Interests With Japan, told the South China Morning Post the row was ongoing for two reasons: one, the 1965 deal did not ""settle all the problems related to our colonial past"", and two, that it ""took away citizens' individual rights to ask for reparations"". The issue of ""comfort women"" remained particularly contentious: in 2015, Japan apologised and promised to pay 1bn yen ($9.5m; £7.9m) - the amount South Korea asked for - to fund victims.  ""Japan and South Korea are now entering a new era,"" Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told reporters at the time. ""We should not drag this problem into the next generation."" But activists say they were not consulted, and rejected the deal. President Moon Jae-in, elected in 2017, suggested it be altered. The historic dispute rumbles on, with neither country looking likely to bend. The issue reared its head again in 2018, when South Korea's top court ordered a Japanese firm to compensate Koreans it used as forced labour. Mitsubishi Heavy, one of the firms involved, has reportedly refused to comply with the court order, while two other companies have had their assets seized in South Korea. The issue has angered many in South Korea, with people boycotting Japanese goods. One man smashed up his Japanese-made car.  It's also led to a flare up in tensions over a group of islands claimed by both countries.  The Japanese government, meanwhile, stuck to its line, saying all reparation issues had been settled by the 1965 treaty. Then, in August 2019, Japan announced it was going to remove Seoul's favoured trade partner status and imposed export controls on its important electronics sector - vital for South Korean companies like Samsung. Seoul then announced it had decided to end the country's intelligence-sharing pact because of the decision. It said it caused a ""grave"" change in security co-operation between the two countries. Japan's Foreign Minister Taro Kono called it a ""complete misjudgement of the current regional security environment"" and said Tokyo would ""strongly protest"" to Seoul about it. There has been no response yet from Washington, which had pushed for the pact three years ago, in part to help track North Korea's missile activity. Stock markets slipped amid fears that the trade spat could badly affect electronics around the world. However, there were perhaps signs tensions may be calming in November, when South Korea announced it had decided to continue a military intelligence-sharing pact."

geopolitical tensions,Petrol price rise warning after oil output cut,2024-09-15,2022-10-05,By Natalie Sherman,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63149044,"Some of the world's top oil-producing countries have agreed to cut the amount they export in a decision expected to raise petrol prices around the world. Members of Opec+ - a group that includes Saudi Arabia and Russia - said they would slash production by two million barrels per day. The group said it wanted to stabilise prices, which have fallen in recent months as the world economy slows. But the decision raised fears that prices for motorists will climb. Expectations that countries were planning to pump less had already pushed oil prices higher this week. The price of a barrel of Brent crude jumped another almost 2% to more than $93 (£82) a barrel on Wednesday. A spokesman for the RAC motoring group said the reduction announced on Wednesday would ""inevitably"" lead to higher oil prices, forcing up the wholesale cost of fuel. ""The question is when, and to what extent, retailers choose to pass these increased costs on at their forecourts,"" spokesman Simon Williams said. The cut announced by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) and allies marks the biggest reduction by the group since the height of the pandemic in 2020. It comes despite pleas from the US and others to pump more, after oil prices spiked this spring when the war in Ukraine disrupted supplies. In a statement, the White House said US President Joe Biden was ""disappointed by the short-sighted decision"".  The US pledged to continue to release oil from national stockpiles ""as appropriate"" and look at other ways to try to rein in prices at the pump, which are a key issue for American voters in midterm elections scheduled for November.  The move is also likely to disrupt US-led efforts to set a price cap for oil from Russia, a plan the US had suggested as a way to limit money flowing into the country and being put towards military use. Opec members defended their decision as a response to significant ""uncertainty"" about future demand for oil, amid fears that the global economy is heading towards a recession. ""The decision is technical, not political,"" United Arab Emirates Energy Minister Suhail al-Mazroui told reporters as Opec+ members gathered in Vienna to discuss the plans. Analysis by Sameer Hashmi, Middle East business correspondent  The latest decision by Opec+ is not just significant for oil markets, but for geopolitics as well.  The fact that the Saudi-led cartel has taken this decision just three months after President Joe Biden's controversial trip to Saudi Arabia to convince the kingdom's de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, to pump more barrels to cool down prices is a huge blow for the White House.  The move not only carries the risk of pushing up oil prices but will also damage efforts by the West to restrict the Russian oil income used to sustain its war in Ukraine. Many countries will see this as a clear indication of major oil producers, especially Saudi Arabia, siding with Russia in the name of protective oil market management.   It appears that the decision had support across the group as the Opec+ energy ministers approved the proposal in a meeting that lasted 30 minutes.  As far as oil markets go, even though this is a substantial reduction, the actual impact on global supplies on the ground would be smaller because several members of Opec+ are already pumping far below their official quotas.  But that may not be enough to calm the sentiments of the oil markets in the coming days. Higher oil prices were a major driver of the increase in consumer prices that hit countries around the world earlier this year, pushing inflation rates to levels not seen in decades and raising political tensions.  The more recent drop had provided some relief to consumers, even as prices of many other staples, including food, continue to rise. A barrel of Brent Crude oil was trading at $84.06 in late September - down from highs of about $130 this spring. Despite falling oil prices and concerns about the global economy, Caroline Bain, chief commodities economist for research firm Capital Economics, said it was unusual timing to slash supply. ""Global oil stocks are historically low and, so far, high prices have failed to materially dent demand,"" she added. Analysts said that the impact of the cuts is likely to be less significant than its size might suggest, since some countries were already producing less than they had said they would, with Capital predicting a 1% drop in global supplies as a result. Kathleen Brooks, director at Minerva Analysis, said the output cut was the ""worst case scenario people were looking for"" - one that would weigh on UK financial markets and raise fears that prices across the economy would continue to rise. It ""changes the narrative in terms of peak inflation - we might not be there yet,"" she said."
geopolitical tensions,Should the West suspect Chinese tech?,2024-09-15,2018-04-17,By Karishma Vaswani,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-43797068,"Both the US and UK have issued warnings about the Chinese technology and telecoms giant ZTE.  The decision by the US Commerce Department to ban American firms from selling equipment to ZTE for the next seven years dates back to a case from a few years ago, when ZTE was accused by the US government of violating sanctions against Iran.  At the time, the US said if ZTE refused to comply, there would be consequences. This week, the US made good on those threats and is hitting ZTE where it hurts. A shortage of US components is likely to cause ZTE to miss shipment deadlines and lose orders, according to investment firm Jefferies. It has cut its estimates for ZTE sales by 13.5% in 2018 and 7.6% in 2019. ZTE's chairman Yin Yimin has reportedly said this is a ""crisis"" and called for his 80,000 strong staff to remain calm, according to a leaked memo seen by the South China Morning Post.  And it's not just the US.  In a seemingly unrelated case, the UK on Monday warned companies about doing business with ZTE, saying its cyber-defence watchdog has blacklisted the Chinese firm over concerns of national security. Granted, these are two different issues, but the incidents highlight one glaring fact: the West is increasingly suspicious of Chinese tech. That suspicion is complicated by the current ""geopolitical tension"", says Chris DeAngelis of the ADG group in Beijing.  Regardless of whether there is truth to the national security concerns, the real issue, he says, is that the US and the UK want to ensure the survival of globally competitive firms that compete with ZTE. The geopolitical tension Mr DeAngelis is referring to is the ongoing trade row between the US and China.  At the heart of this spat, as I've said before, is that the US says China forced American companies that wanted access to low-cost labour and the massive market to tie up with Chinese companies - in effect allowing them to copy and steal American ideas.  China says that's not true, and Beijing has been very vocal about the way it perceives its firms are being treated by the West. China's Ministry of Commerce has urged the United States to ""create fair, just, and stable legal and policy environment for Chinese companies"", with regards to the ZTE decision. And perhaps more notably, it also said it was prepared to take action to protect the interests of Chinese firms.  ZTE is not the only Chinese tech firm that's been targeted by the West.  China's Huawei, for example, has been blocked from striking a deal to sell its new smartphone via a US carrier over security concerns. And Broadcom, a firm formerly domiciled in Singapore, had its bid to takeover Qualcomm blocked because of US national security concerns that specifically cited Huawei and Chinese technology. At the crux of this is a suspicion that Chinese companies are the eyes and ears of the Chinese government in Western markets. Whether those suspicions are warranted is hard to prove, but ""there is no question that telecom and communications is a valid security risk"", Mr DeAngelis told me. ""If you have a problem in a network, do you really want to rely on your vendor if you are in the middle of a trade war, for example?"" he said. Most of the narrative on Chinese tech is that they've copied American ideas and then sold them back to the West at cheaper prices.  While that may have been true in the past, it's certainly not fair to say that today.  My experience of reporting on Chinese tech over the last few years has shown me that Chinese companies are innovating at a pace that is often unparalleled by other countries. Recently, Chinese firms have also beaten global firms in China, as ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing proved recently by driving Uber out. Some say the West's fear originates in envy and an ignorance of just how hard Chinese firms can make their staff work. ""Unless people have seen the Chinese tech culture known as 996, they don't understand Chinese tech,"" writes Lawrence Kuok in supchina.com. (The number 996 refers to the Chinese tech firms' practice of working from 9am to 9pm, six days a week.)  ""What I think a lot of people don't understand about the Chinese market is that there are many aspects that require pure and utter hard work,"" he said. Chinese tech firms do get help from their government, in the form of protection of the domestic market, which has allowed them to grow and dominate in China. That's not to say they're not formidable players in their own right, though.  But China, and Chinese firms, are used to having a longer term view.

geopolitical tensions,US markets pick up amid global sell-off,2024-09-15,2018-10-23,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45957674,"US stock markets have begun to recover from a global sell-off, regaining most of their losses in the final hour of trading. The three major indexes closed between 0.4% and 0.6% lower, having earlier been down over 2% with the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq both at six-month lows. The recovery comes after sharp falls in European and Asian markets, with London's FTSE 100 on track for its worst monthly performance in a decade. Asian stocks also fell overnight. Analysts said it was hard to pinpoint the global falls on one particular factor. In Europe, they said the sell-off had been exacerbated by fears over the situation in Italy, which has the second-highest national debt in the eurozone. The European Commission has told the country to revise its budget, the first time it has ever made such a request.  Meanwhile, there are also fears over the impact on trade of the current situation in Saudi Arabia, where the Kingdom is facing pressure over the death of prominent Saudi critic journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The country is one of the world's largest oil exporters and investors are concerned about the threat of possible sanctions. ING strategist Benjamin Schroeder blamed ""a concoction of concerns"" for the falls, saying investors' overall sentiment was suffering from trade tensions, fears over Italy and Brexit.  While Charles Schwab analysts said these general fears were ""exacerbating already skittish global sentiment"". Neil Wilson, chief market analyst for Markets.com, said the general tone was ""not good"". He said it was ""hard to say"" what was driving the falls, but ""the old adage that the market hates uncertainty holds true"". ""But it's not all geopolitical noise and fears about rates - some notable earnings announcements have also rocked confidence,"" he said, noting that disappointing performances from 3M and Caterpillar had hit the Dow's performance.

geopolitical tensions,What if a rogue nation dimmed the Sun?,2024-09-15,2023-10-11,India Bourke,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20231010-sun-solar-geoengineering-ministry-for-the-future-kim-stanley-robinson,"In an influential cli-fi novel, a desperate government ignores international consensus and pumps aerosols into the atmosphere to cool the world. Could it happen for real? What if climate change became so intense that one country broke with international protocol to protect its people? In fiction, that scenario has already played out. Kim Stanley Robinson's 2020 novel Ministry for the Future opens with a catastrophic heatwave in India sparking a climate disaster of unmatched scale: 20 million people die as extreme temperatures take a horrific toll. Unwilling to let such a threat recur, the country's leaders decide to take drastic action: by unilaterally dimming the Sun.  Day after day for seven months, fleets of India's planes pump vast plumes of aerosols into the stratosphere. From there, the mix of sulphur dioxide and other chemical particulates slowly spread across the northern hemisphere and ""eventually everywhere"".  By reflecting sunlight back into space, the particulates act as a planetary parasol, mimicking the effect of large-scale volcanic eruptions. The sky turns whiter, sunsets redder and the planet cools. The contentious move flies in the face of international law, as the book imagines it, and risks disrupting monsoon rains – but it also reduces global temperatures by ""one degree, for three years"". In Robinson's imagined scenario, India's rogue deployment of solar geo-engineering turns out to be broadly benign, and buys time to scale-up emissions reductions. But in the real-world, the idea that such a deus ex machina technology could ever be safely deployed remains highly speculative, with many risks and unknowns. So if one rogue nation did decide to dim the Sun for real, what environmental and geopolitical consequences might unfurl? And is the safe deployment of such a technology even a conceivable goal?  This January, more than 440 scientists signed an open letter calling for a non-use agreement on solar geoengineering – including for small-scale outdoor experiments, like the unauthorised test conducted by a San Francisco start-up in Mexico earlier this year. They argue that the side-effects are unpredictable, the current global governance system is ""incapable"" of guaranteeing fair and effective control, and that development might encourage ""normalisation"" of the technology as part of the world's climate policy. Its cooling effect could create a ""moral hazard"", numerous researchers and civil society organisations warn, by taking pressure off efforts to cut the underlying CO2 emissions. Such concerns have so far resulted in a de-facto moratorium on deployment, while a planned field test over Sweden was cancelled in the wake of objections. ""When you're in a hole, stop digging"", is how Greta Thunberg expressed the fear that solar geoengineering will reinforce a planetary relationship based on extraction and exploitation. ""A crisis created by lack of respect for nature will most likely not be solved by taking that lack of respect to the next level."" Andreas Malm, associate professor of human ecology at Lund University in Sweden and author of How to Blow Up a Pipeline, agrees. ""The worst-case scenario for the deployment of geoengineering,"" he says, ""is that you have it and then business as usual just continues with investment in fossil fuels and their infrastructure – and emissions continue to rise."" You'd then have to keep increasing the injections, he argues, which would only exacerbate the risks. As Malm wrote in 2021, Robinson's novel introduces a global armed struggle against fossil fuel capital at the same time as the solar geoengineering experiment. Without this added incentive to decarbonise, Malm fears the world would be too tempted to simply delay emissions cuts. And it's a fear he still holds today. ""The more I've read on this, the more I'm convinced this technology has such extraordinary potential for harm and destruction, that I don't think I will ever personally support or advocate,"" he says. Cooling eclipses This Saturday in many parts of the Americas, the Sun will be blocked during the daytime – and local temperatures will likely drop by a few degrees. The cause won't be geoengineering, but the Moon passing in front of the Sun: an annular solar eclipse. When a similar eclipse passed over India in 2020, researchers found that it affected the weather in eight cities. As well as a temporary cooling effect due to a substantial fall in solar radiation, wind speeds dropped and humidity rose. The drop in sunlight also meant less surface ozone, an air pollutant. Yet in the three years since the publication of Robinson's novel, global emissions have continued to rise, exacerbating everything from unprecedented heatwaves to deadly floods. This summer in the Northern hemisphere was the hottest on record, and September's global temperature jumped again by a huge margin. Amid these rises, some researchers suggest there could be a case for emergency solar geoengineering as an accompaniment to decarbonisation. In the US, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine last year recommended a national research programme on Solar Radiation Modification [SRM] – as the technology is also known. This year, the White House issued a report that examined what a federally-funded research programme might entail. And in the private sector, money from US tech giants and billionaires is flowing towards further investigation. This February, dozens of scientists published an alternative open letter, organised by Sarah Doherty, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Washington, arguing more research is needed. And there are growing calls for a clearer international consensus on rules – one way or the other. The UN Environment Program has noted a ""dearth of data"" on impacts, and the EU has called for international talks about its risks. As for Robinson, whose novel has helped foment so much discussion, he stressed to BBC Future that his book was not proposing a plan: ""I abjure prediction, or even prescriptions"". Yet he also pointed to the need to take ""emergency actions"" to reduce the damage caused by burning carbon – from finding new ways to pay for decarbonisation, to exploring options for non-solar geoengineering. ""I object to anyone saying 'Oh we can't try to fix things because it will encourage fossil fuel promoters to keep breaking things!' We're past that moment now. The sense of emergency is intensifying year by year."" So what might it look like in reality? Alternative methods of solar geoengineering are all now competing for their moment in the spotlight, from marine cloud brightening (which would inject sea salt aerosols into low-lying clouds to increase their reflectivity), to cirrus cloud thinning (which would inject ice nuclei into high clouds, shortening their life-span and allowing more heat to escape into space). But stratospheric sulphate aerosol injection by aeroplane remains the best-studied proposal for global impact. The technology could potentially lower temperatures at speed, and with relatively low finance. One 2013 estimate equates start-up costs to ""the price of a Hollywood blockbuster"". A more recent calculation of running costs comes in at around $18bn (£16bn) a year. Research supports a slightly different technical vision than in Robinson's novel, however, with scientists suggesting a much slower ramp up, deployment and decline. One paper recommends that if stratospheric injections begin around 2030, they should peak 50 years later before tapering-off over two centuries. Another study has injections starting in 2035 and running at least until 2100; another estimates a duration of 245-315 years.   Particulates fall back to Earth after about 12 months, so too short a run-time could only see minimal cooling effect. But if longer releases end too abruptly, a ""termination shock"" could also follow – unleashing devastating pent-up warming from emissions whose effects have only been masked and not removed.  Among the most prominent proponents of further research is David Keith, head of climate systems engineering at the University of Chicago (and founder of a Canadian company developing technologies for carbon removal). Like in the novel, Keith has stressed that solar geoengineering should not substitute mitigation, but instead be used to help the world maintain global temperatures rise below the crucial 1.5C above pre-industrial levels; a threshold the World Meteorological Organization gives a 66% likelihood of overshooting by 2027. And, as in Robinson's book, Keith and others have also stressed climate change's increased threat to the world's poorest – especially those in the Global South. They note ""an obligation"" to take steps to reduce such harm and a ""moral obligation to conduct research on solar geoengineering"". As the former president of the sinking islands of Kiribati, Anote Tong, this year told the website Climate Home: ""we are facing a catastrophe and we're trying to survive. What other options do we have?"" It would not be a Global South nation that would likely deploy the technology, however, says Wake Smith, a climate researcher at the Yale School of the Environment and a former aviation industry expert. According to Smith, stratospheric aerosol injection would require ""a fleet of several hundred large high-altitude jets of a sort that does not currently exist"". These specialist planes would collectively need to release millions of tonnes of chemicals at an altitude of roughly 20km (66,000ft). The only countries that could build such fleets, Smith claims, are the US, UK, France, Russia or China, and potentially Germany or Japan. ""No other state is technologically capable, and this is vastly too big for individuals or companies to pursue."" It would also not be possible for India alone to create the kind of global cooling that Robinson's novel envisages, Smith contends. If aerosols were released over northern India, the planet's rotation would spread them into a ring around the Earth, from where an atmospheric system called the Brewer Dobson Circulation would carry them to the North Pole and they would descend – directly cooling the northern hemisphere only. An equivalent southern hemisphere deployment would also then be necessary, Smith suggests, in order to attempt to counterbalance the resulting redistribution of weather systems. Such far-reaching geophysical impacts means any rogue nation would be unlikely to remain solo for long, Smith says, either being deterred from their efforts or joined by others. Can we predict any side-effects? Yet even if a future large techno-power could press ahead with deployment, that doesn't mean they would or should. Aside from the possibility it could slow efforts to reduce emissions, there are also numerous other environmental hazards that could result. As Elizabeth Kolbert illustrated in her 2021 book Under A White Sky: The Nature of the Future, humanity's attempts to control nature are littered with unforeseen disasters. There may come a point at which solar geoengineering's benefits are necessary, she implies – but history suggests it would be naive to hope that fearsome consequences won't result. So can scientists predict what those environmental consequences might be? To date, models and simulations show that stratospheric aerosol injection could impact everything from the position of the jet stream to causing regional droughts. One study has noted a potential for extended Arctic summer sea ice loss, while another points to a ""considerable reduction"" in monsoon precipitation. And, even if deployed consistently, crops could still suffer.  Among the most potentially consequential effects is damage to the atmosphere's protective ozone layer. A 2022 UNEP report into its depletion noted ""shortcomings"" in the modelling on solar geoengineering's impact. The technology would also do nothing to stop rising CO2 concentrations from acidifying the oceans. How bad might such side-effects be? Karen Rosenlof, a senior scientist at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Chemical Science Laboratory, is part of a group of researchers analysing the atmospheric impacts of various existing aerosol-based phenomena – from rocket emissions and satellite re-entry to volcanic eruptions. These instances can all be used to learn about ""possible impacts"" of deliberate aerosol injection, she notes, but different properties of various aerosols (sulphate, soot, organic carbon and metals) all have different effects. As do how high, where, when and in what volume the substances are released.  There is also no analogue for continuous emission, as volcanoes are sporadic. Nor a complete knowledge of how various parts of the climate system interact. What there is, Rosenlof stresses, is ""a lot of uncertainty"".  How would the world react? As the above suggests, not all solar geoengineering's effects are distributed equally – and what might be welcome lower rainfall in one place could spell disastrous drought in another. Such uneven distribution of impacts means any unilateral attempt to dim the Sun would likely be squashed by more powerful neighbours, some suggest. Or that only nations geopolitically big, bold and brazen enough would ever dare to deploy in the first place. For Frank Biermann, professor of Global Sustainability Governance at Utrecht University in the Netherlands and founder of the Earth System Governance Project, the US is the most likely candidate in such a scenario: ""If the majority of countries object to the deployment… the political cost for any country to do it unilaterally is extremely high.""  If one nation or more were to push ahead regardless of such tensions, however, the worst-case scenarios are numerous. Countermeasures ranging from economic sanctions, to UN intervention and potentially armed conflict could all be deployed, says Biermann, with the ultimate result ""difficult to predict"". There is also a possibility that an arms-race develops, with nations developing the technology simply because rival superpowers are doing likewise.  To prevent this, Biermann argues you would need to stop the technology from getting to the level of development reached by nuclear bombs, such as via the non-use agreement he and others have proposed. The Chemical Weapons Convention, which aims to prevent both the development and use of chemical weapons, is a Nobel Peace Prize-receiving precedent. But what if a group of nations, or even the entire world, agreed to act in concert? For Smith, there might come a scenario where deployment serves a majority of interests. The ""most plausible scenario"" for deployment, he suggests, is an escalating climate emergency leading to mass global migration from south to north, with the north unwilling to provide the relief the south needs. ""While multiple, competing deployment programmes are a possibility, the incentives in this case actually favour a single, global programme,"" he says. ""Existing political structures are not well-suited to govern this, but neither are they well-suited to trapping hundreds of millions of people in faltering economies against their will."" How far such a ""single, global programme"" is realistic is another thing. Keith has noted potential precedents in global central banking, the Internet, and air traffic control. Others point to the United Nations framework Convention on Climate Change, and the resulting Paris Agreement, under which nations have pledged to limit global temperatures. (Though the world is currently on track to miss the very targets this agreement has set). For sceptics, meanwhile, a consistently globally united effort is simply not a likely prospect. In the case of any longer-term deployment, avoiding ""termination shock"" – where stopping too fast unleashes catastrophic warming – would mean ruling out a whole host of all-too-viable eventualities: from terrorists shooting down planes, to war, pandemics or even natural disasters.  There simply isn't yet enough modelling of the geopolitical consequences, says Olaf Corry, professor of global security challenges at Leeds University in the UK. ""The scientists are good people, and they're modelling [the physical impacts], but in their model-world, there isn't any geopolitics."" In contrast, military planners and retired generals have told Corry that testing could be seen as a potentially hostile act and that they are concerned about other powers acquiring it. Think Russia invading Ukraine, but with the potential to switch off a global weather-creating technology. Deployment could also risk opening up a whole new arena of disinformation about why the weather was changing, he suggests, and ""infect"" the rest of climate politics. ""The whole relationship between science and society is already strained after Covid,"" says Corry. ""So you would have an extraordinary potential for conspiracy theories and for misinformation, and an incredibly difficult environment for science to do its job."" Plus there are also the questions of justice and equity. Shuchi Talati of The Alliance for Just Deliberation on Solar Geoengineering, a US non-profit, is working to help spread awareness and ""ensure climate vulnerable communities and countries – mostly in Global South – have access to information, knowledge and resources"" about the technology. This in turn, she hopes, will allow ""robust governance frameworks"" to be built collaboratively. But even with more awareness, Global South nations have less likelihood of developing the technology because of the scale and technology required, and already have less representation in international bodies like the UN Security Council. The voices of the most vulnerable nations would likely still be muted, warns Silvia Ribeiro of the Action Group on Erosion Technology and Concentration, which monitors the impact of emerging technologies. If one Global South country were to deploy at scale, it ""would cause so many geopolitical conflicts that no Global South country would be in a position to handle"". For Lili Fuhr, a director at the Center for International Environmental Law, a non-profit organisation based in Washington DC, the technology ""requires governance systems much more sophisticated than anything that has ever existed and that would have to function over centuries or millennia – an impossible requirement."" Others, however, still see room for optimism – including Kim Stanley Robinson himself. In his novel, Ministry For the Future, the severity of the climate emergency is such that a violent global resistance movement against fossil fuels also emerges. Yet the world feels ""less dark"" now than when he was writing the novel, Robinson said recently on a Bloomberg podcast, and there the impetus for such extreme measures might not arise. Robinson told BBC Future that though climate disasters are increasing, so too is the international momentum to act. ""My impression is that the pandemic shocked people into a new world of awareness that the biosphere matters and can severely disrupt civilisation – we saw it happen.""  Since the chances of overshooting the 1.5C limit are still high (but not yet inevitable), ""all possible means"" are going to be needed to draw down CO2 from the atmosphere, Robinson adds. ""We might have to try various methods grouped under the word 'geoengineering' to cool things if we can, while the decarbonization proceeds. Groups like C2G and Silver Lining and TerraPraxis, and I assume many others, are trying to stimulate these discussions to prepare the public for possible interventions, and I think the widespread hope is that if we ever do such things it will be by way of international agreements and general consensus.""  Meanwhile, on solar geoengineering specifically, Robinson is not convinced by arguments it would cause decarbonisation efforts to slow: ""I think we're past that moment. The imperative to decarbonise ASAP is just too clear now. Any climate sceptics left are frauds or fools.""  * India Bourke is a freelance writer and editor for BBC Future Planet. -- Join one million Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.

geopolitical tensions,Huge crowds at funeral for Iranian commander,2024-09-15,2020-01-06,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-51004688,"Huge crowds have packed the streets of the Iranian capital Tehran for the funeral of military commander Qasem Soleimani. Soleimani was assassinated in a US drone strike in Iraq on Friday on the orders of President Donald Trump.  Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei led prayers and at one point was seen weeping. Iran has vowed ""severe revenge"" for the death of Soleimani and on Sunday pulled back from the 2015 nuclear accord.  Soleimani, 62, headed Iran's elite Quds Force, and was tasked with protecting and boosting Iran's influence in the Middle East.  He supported Syria's President Bashar al-Assad in the country's civil conflict, aided the Shia militant group Hezbollah in Lebanon, and guided Iraqi militia groups against the Islamic State group.  The US saw him as a terrorist, and President Trump said Soleimani was plotting ""imminent"" attacks on US diplomats and military personnel. In Iran, Soleimani was hailed as a national hero and widely considered the second most powerful man in the country behind Supreme Leader Khamenei.  But not all Iranians are as distressed about the general's death as the mourners who lined Tehran's streets, says BBC Middle East Editor Jeremy Bowen. Soleimani was a hardliner and a dominant force in a regime that shot dead scores of protesters at the end of 2019. He also spent vast sums building up alliances and militias in Lebanon, Yemen, Iraq and Syria at a time when US sanctions are impoverishing many Iranians, our correspondent says.  State television showed huge crowds in Tehran for the event. It put the number who turned out as ""millions"" although this is yet to be verified.  Some people cried, while others clutched pictures of the late commander. Mourners passed Soleimani's coffin over their heads and ""death to America"" chants were heard.  His daughter Zeinab Soleimani warned the US that it faced a ""dark day"".  ""Crazy Trump, don't think that everything is over with my father's martyrdom,"" she said.  Soleimani's remains were then taken to Qom, one of the centres of Shia Islam, where massive crowds also gathered for a ceremony. The general will be buried in his hometown of Kerman on Tuesday. On Sunday Iran declared it would no longer abide by any of the restrictions imposed by the 2015 nuclear deal. The deal limited Iranian nuclear capacities in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. Three European parties to the deal - Germany, France and the UK - urged Iran to abide by its terms. Also on Sunday, Iraqi MPs passed a non-binding resolution calling for foreign troops to leave. US forces had been invited back to Iraq in 2014 to help defeat the Islamic State group, and there are about 5,000 in the country. The new head of Iran's Quds force has vowed to expel the US from the Middle East. Meanwhile, BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner says an Iranian official told him he backed a claim by Iraq's PM that Soleimani was carrying an Iranian response to a Saudi peace overture. Following warnings from Iran, Mr Trump said that the US would respond in the event of retaliation for Soleimani's death, ""perhaps in a disproportionate manner"". He repeated a threat to target Iranian cultural sites, saying the US would ""strike very fast and very hard"" if Tehran attacked Americans or US assets. President Trump also threatened severe sanctions against Iraq if US troops left.  ""We have a very extraordinarily expensive airbase that's there. It cost billions of dollars to build. We're not leaving unless they pay us back for it,"" he told reporters. The president on Monday also responded to Iran's decision to no longer abide by the nuclear deal, tweeting: ""Iran will never have a nuclear weapon!"" A number of political leaders across the world have called for restraint, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson in a joint statement. Nato's ruling council met on Monday to discuss the crisis and made a similar call. Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Nato had suspended its training operations within Iraq as a precautionary measure to protect personnel. He said the decision to kill Soleimani had been made by the US alone, but that all Nato members had shown ""very strong unity"" and expressed concerned about Iran's ""destabilising actions in the region"". UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged restraint, saying: ""Geopolitical tensions are at their highest level this century."" Mrs Merkel will travel to Russia later this week for talks with President Vladimir Putin. Markets have remained turbulent. Brent crude oil topped $70 (£53) a barrel on Monday for the first time since September. The BBC's Persian service has been seeking the views of Iranians on Soleimani's killing. ""I believe Soleimani did not deserve such a fate. He did a lot for Iran, to protect this country. Our enemies have been attacking us for the past four decades and he tried to save the country,"" - Paniz (f) ""Soleimani was not a hero, in my opinion he was a soldier and overrated by the establishment. People are being too emotional about him,"" - Erfan (m) The suggestion that the US could target Iranian cultural sites sparked alarm in Iran and beyond. Such action could be considered a war crime under international law.  Iran is home to two dozen Unesco World Heritage sites. These are sites that the UN's cultural organisation believes need preserving for their cultural, historic or scientific significance.

geopolitical tensions,Singapore becoming hub for China's tech giants,2024-09-15,2020-09-16,By Justin Harper,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-54172703,"Some of China's biggest technology firms are expanding operations in Singapore as tensions rise between Washington and Beijing.  Tencent and Alibaba are increasing their presence in the city state while TikTok owner ByteDance is reported to be investing billions of dollars.  Considered neutral territory, Singapore has good ties to both the US and China. Relations between Washington and Beijing are growing increasingly hostile, particularly over technology. Tencent announced this week it was ""expanding its business presence in Singapore to support our growing business in South East Asia and beyond"". The new regional office is described as a ""strategic addition"" to its current offices in South East Asia. Tencent's WeChat messaging app is facing a ban this month in the US, along with TikTok, under the Trump administration's clampdown on Chinese apps and tech firms. Donald Trump has already imposed bans on Chinese telecoms firm Huawei. ""Given the US-China tensions in tech and the heightening risk of decoupling, it makes sense for Chinese tech companies to separate operations in China and outside of China,"" said Tommy Wu at Oxford Economics. ""Singapore would be an ideal location given the city state's comparative advantage in tech, its geographic proximity to China and as an innovation hub in South East Asia."" Singapore has always been seen as a regional base for Western firms because of its advanced financial and legal system. Now it's firmly on the radar of Chinese companies. The political turmoil in Hong Kong and the introduction of China's controversial national security law has seen many firms look for a more stable business environment within Asia. But there is another reason why Singapore is so attractive to China, according to Nick Redfearn, deputy chief executive at UK-based consultancy Rouse.  It could explain why the city state has attracted so much foreign direct investment (FDI) compared to other South East Asia countries he said. ""This is usually because regional headquarters, operating on behalf of parent companies, act as the foreign investor in countries such as the Philippines, Indonesia, Vietnam and elsewhere.  ""This can help Chinese companies avoid the appearance of Chinese investment,"" he said. South East Asia overtook the EU to become China's largest regional trading partner in 2020, according to Mr Redfearn. Rui Ma, a Chinese tech expert and investor, added: ""You've seen Western companies (Google, Facebook, LinkedIn and many more) make it their Asia Pacific headquarters for a while now, so it's natural Chinese companies also consider it for the same reasons.  ""I think the recent US-China geopolitical tensions only make it even more attractive, but that's not the only or primary reason."" She says globalisation is another driving force. ""If Western companies can be global, why can't we?   ""Chinese companies are very much willing to invest for the long term and are not going to be content to be left behind when it comes to future opportunities."""
geopolitical tensions,"Partition 70 years on: The turmoil, trauma - and legacy",2024-09-15,2017-07-26,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-40643413,"As India and Pakistan celebrate 70 years of independence, Andrew Whitehead looks at the lasting legacy of the Partition of British India, and the turmoil and trauma which marred the birth of the two nations. It's about 700km (430 miles) from Delhi to Islamabad - less than the distance between London and Geneva. A short hop in aviation terms.  But you can't fly non-stop from the Indian capital to the Pakistani capital. There are no direct flights at all. It is only one of the legacies of seven decades of mutual suspicion and tension. Take another example: cricket.  India and Pakistan played each other a few weeks ago in the final of the Champions' Trophy. Both countries are cricket crazy.  Read more: Special report on partition However, the game was played not in South Asia, but in London. India and Pakistan don't play cricket in each other's countries any more, although they have met in one-day matches around the world, including in countries in their region like Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.  But it is almost 10 years since they faced each other on South Asian soil in a Test match. Despite a lot of shared culture and history, they are not simply rivals, but more like enemies.  In the 70 years since India and Pakistan gained independence, they have fought three wars. Some would say four, although when their armies last fought in 1999, there was no formal declaration of war.  The simmering tension between India and Pakistan is one of the world's most enduring geopolitical fault lines. It has prompted both countries to develop their own nuclear weapons.  So the uneasy stand-off is much more than a regional dispute: it is fraught with wider danger. India and Pakistan gained their independence at the same moment. British rule over India, by far its biggest colony, ended on 15 August 1947.  After months of political deadlock, Britain agreed to divide the country in two.  A separate and mainly Muslim nation, Pakistan, was created to meet concerns that the large Muslim minority would be at a disadvantage in Hindu-majority India.  This involved partitioning two of India's biggest provinces, Punjab and Bengal. The details of where the new international boundary would lie were made public only two days after independence. Partition triggered one of the great calamities of the modern era, perhaps the biggest movement of people - outside war and famine - that the world has ever seen.  No one knows the precise numbers, but about 12 million people became refugees as they sought desperately to move from one newly independent nation to another.  Amid a terrible slaughter in which all main communities were both aggressors and victims, somewhere between half a million and a million people were killed.  Tens of thousands of women were abducted, usually by men of a different religion.  In Punjab in particular, where Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs had lived together for generations and spoke the same language, a stark segregation was brought about as Muslims headed west to Pakistan and Hindus and Sikhs fled east to India. This was not a civil war with battle lines and rival armies - but nor was it simply spontaneous violence.  On all sides, local militias and armed gangs planned how to inflict the greatest harm on those they had come to see as their enemies.  Those wounds have been left to fester. No one has been held to account - there's been no reconciliation process - and for a long time, the full story of what happened has been smothered in silence.  Literature and cinema found ways of representing the horror of what happened. Historians initially focused on the politics of Partition. It took them much longer to turn their attention to the lived experience of this profound rupture.  How a jacket and a briefcase shaped a Partition love story How India's 'Flying Sikh' went from Partition orphan to gold medallist Big oral history projects have got under way only in the last few years, as the number of survivors dwindles. There are no towering memorials to the Partition dead.  The first museum devoted to Partition opened in 2016 in Amritsar in Indian Punjab. Partition poisoned relations between India and Pakistan, and has shaped - many would say distorted - the geopolitics of South Asia as a whole.  Pakistan initially consisted of two wings 2,000km (1,240 miles) apart, but in 1971, East Pakistan gained its independence, with Indian military support. Another new nation, Bangladesh, was born. Among the loose ends of the independence arrangement was the future of Kashmir, a princely state in the foothills of the Himalayas which had a largely Muslim population. The maharaja, a Hindu, decided his state should become part of India.  Within months, Indian and Pakistani troops were fighting each other for control of Kashmir.  The complex conflict remains unresolved and, more than any other issue, has bedevilled relations between the two countries.  Kashmir: Why India and Pakistan fight over it India also accuses Pakistan of supporting militant organisations which have carried out terrorist-style attacks in Indian cities. Pakistan says India colludes with breakaway movements in areas such as Balochistan.  The political leaders of the two countries have met from time to time. There have been occasional hopes of a breakthrough in relations but, at the moment, relations are distinctly frosty. The consequences have been far-reaching.  India has much more trade with countries such as Nigeria, Belgium or South Africa than with its neighbour to the west.  Although India's phenomenally successful Hindi-language film industry - known as Bollywood - is hugely popular in Pakistan, and Pakistan's TV soaps are eagerly watched in India, cultural links are fragile.  When tensions rise, which they do regularly, every aspect of relations suffers.  Just a few months ago, one of India's leading film directors Karan Johar felt obliged to promise that he would never again cast a Pakistani actor in one of his movies.  The two countries are not well informed about what is happening on the other side of the border. No major Indian or Pakistani news organisation currently has a correspondent in the other country's capital. For both Indians and Pakistanis, travelling to the other country is not easy - even if it is to visit family.  It is not the difficulty of getting a visa or the lack of direct flights between the two capital cities. There are very few air links between the two countries at all. Despite a lengthy shared border, India and Pakistan have hardly any border crossings. In Pakistan, the army and its intelligence wing are by far the most powerful institutions - and the country has had repeated spells of military rule.  The abiding sense of a military threat from its much larger neighbour has - many feel - boosted the power of the armed forces and hindered the development of a mature democracy.   Pakistan has a population of about 200 million - mostly Muslims. India has almost 1,300 million citizens and about one in seven follow Islam. There are almost as many Indian Muslims as Pakistani Muslims.  One projection suggests that by 2050, India will overtake Indonesia to become the country with the world's biggest Muslim population. But Muslims are under-represented in India's parliament and many other areas of public life.  Some observers believe the perception - however unfair - that Indian Muslims sympathise with Pakistan has fed prejudice and discrimination. The pride that almost all Indians and Pakistanis feel about their nation is self-evident. Patriotism is a powerful force in both countries.  It is on public display every time they play each other at cricket. But both have been unable to overcome the legacy of the tragedy which accompanied what should have been their finest moment 70 years ago. And the result of their most recent tussle on the cricket pitch? Well, for the record, Pakistan won a surprise - and emphatic - victory.   Some in India were gracious in defeat. But on social media, and some sections of India's news media, there was anger and anguish - losing face to your old rival remains, for many, almost too painful to endure.

geopolitical tensions,Hancock before Covid Inquiry and doctors to strike,2024-09-15,2023-06-28,By BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-66038467,"A number of the papers lead with Matt Hancock's appearance before the Covid Inquiry on Tuesday.

He said the plans had always assumed it would not be possible to stop a virus spreading, so had focused on questions like how to procure enough body bags or find space for the dead instead of how to suppress an outbreak.

geopolitical tensions,Viewpoint: Why is Modi meeting Xi now?,2024-09-15,2018-04-26,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-43904086,"Friday's informal talks between Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping mark an improvement in relations. Analyst Shashank Joshi explains why. Last year, India and China were locked in their most serious border crisis in the last three decades. China's state-controlled media was issuing near-daily threats of war, as both sides built up forces on the edge of the tiny Kingdom of Bhutan.  It would have seemed implausible that, just eight months on, Mr Modi and Mr Xi would be meeting at an informal summit. But this is exactly what it is happening in the Chinese city of Wuhan, as the two leaders convene far from their capitals, without aides or an agenda, and plenty of time to discuss their mounting differences.  But the meeting does not come out of the blue. After the border dispute was defused in August, Mr Modi and Mr Xi broke the ice at the Brics summit in September, alongside the leaders of Russia, Brazil and South Africa.  A flurry of high-level visits to China followed, including by India's foreign secretary, national security adviser, foreign minister and defence minister. There were also some olive branches. In February, the Indian government sent out a private note asking officials to keep away from events marking the 60th anniversary of the Dalai Lama's exile from Tibet. It  quietly informed Beijing of this. China considers the Dalai Lama a separatist and tries to isolate the spiritual leader by asking foreign leaders not to see him. In March, Mr Modi followed up with fulsome congratulations to Mr Xi on his re-appointment as president, saying it showed Mr Xi enjoyed the ""support of the whole Chinese nation"". In recent days,  China reciprocated. It will resume sharing hydrological data on the rivers that run into India and has offered to re-start low-level military exercises; both activities were suspended during last year's crisis. So why is this thaw occurring now? There are several reasons. Firstly, India believes that last year's crisis marked a dangerous phase in the relationship and that tensions need to be kept in check - especially with national elections in 2019. More broadly, China's economy is five times bigger than India's and its defence spending is three times as large.  While India has a local military advantage at many points on the border, it still needs time to build up its strength. Secondly, India hopes to secure Beijing's cooperation on several issues where China's role is crucial, such as putting pressure on Pakistan-based terrorist groups and securing India's admission to the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), a body that controls nuclear trade.  In recent years, Indians have grown increasingly frustrated at what they see as Chinese efforts to thwart India's rise, but Delhi has not given up on nudging Mr Xi in a more flexible direction. Thirdly, India is responding to an uncertain period in world politics. India's concern is that Beijing will improve ties both with Washington, because of the North Korean crisis, and with Moscow, because of the rupture in West-Russia relations, all at Delhi's expense. Better, in this view, that India hedges its bets now.  ""With a strengthening Russia-China axis and with the US taking its eye off China to deal with Russia,"" warned PS Raghavan, a former ambassador and chairman of a body that advises the Indian government on national security, ""it is prudent for India to maintain a harmonious dialogue with China, even as we deal with the wrinkles in our relations with the other two great powers.""  Of course, there are advantages for China too. Last year, India was the only country to publicly reject China's flagship Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a network of infrastructure investment stretching from Asia to Europe.  More recently, the US, Japan and even the EU have grown more sceptical of the project, which they argue is skewed towards Chinese companies, saddles small countries with unsustainable debt and masks strategic, rather than economic, ambitions. China is eager to dampen India's hostility to the scheme. It is also concerned about last year's meeting of India, the US, Japan and Australia - informally known as the Quad - after a decade-long hiatus, and their joint efforts to develop alternatives to the BRI. By engaging Mr Modi, Mr Xi hopes to slow India's steady drift towards America and its allies. Nevertheless, it is premature to see this as a rapprochement. Beneath the thaw, the currents of competition swirl stronger than ever - on air, land and sea.  India just concluded its largest-ever air exercises, pointedly demonstrating how it could move hundreds of aircraft from its Pakistan-facing western sector to the China-facing eastern sector in under 48 hours.   On the ground, the dispute at the heart of last summer's standoff is dormant rather than resolved. China has built up its forces a stone's throw from the flashpoint, while India has upped its own presence and patrols the border more aggressively. The maritime contest is most vigorous of all. China, fresh from opening its first overseas military base in Djibouti, on the Horn of Africa, is deepening its involvement in the small island nations to India's south.  The Indian Navy, whose most important task is now watching the Chinese naval vessels that roam the Indian Ocean in growing numbers, has recently signed agreements giving it access to the facilities of the US, France and Oman.  No doubt the relaxed surroundings of Wuhan will help the two leaders have a candid discussion on the issues that divide them, and we may see a further softening of tone. But beyond the bonhomie, this strategic competition for power and influence is unlikely to slow down. Shashank Joshi is a Senior Research Fellow at the Royal United Services Institute."
geopolitical tensions,Petrol price rise warning after oil output cut,2024-09-15,2022-10-05,By Natalie Sherman,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63149044,"Some of the world's top oil-producing countries have agreed to cut the amount they export in a decision expected to raise petrol prices around the world. Members of Opec+ - a group that includes Saudi Arabia and Russia - said they would slash production by two million barrels per day. The group said it wanted to stabilise prices, which have fallen in recent months as the world economy slows. But the decision raised fears that prices for motorists will climb. Expectations that countries were planning to pump less had already pushed oil prices higher this week. The price of a barrel of Brent crude jumped another almost 2% to more than $93 (£82) a barrel on Wednesday. A spokesman for the RAC motoring group said the reduction announced on Wednesday would ""inevitably"" lead to higher oil prices, forcing up the wholesale cost of fuel. ""The question is when, and to what extent, retailers choose to pass these increased costs on at their forecourts,"" spokesman Simon Williams said. The cut announced by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) and allies marks the biggest reduction by the group since the height of the pandemic in 2020. It comes despite pleas from the US and others to pump more, after oil prices spiked this spring when the war in Ukraine disrupted supplies. In a statement, the White House said US President Joe Biden was ""disappointed by the short-sighted decision"".  The US pledged to continue to release oil from national stockpiles ""as appropriate"" and look at other ways to try to rein in prices at the pump, which are a key issue for American voters in midterm elections scheduled for November.  The move is also likely to disrupt US-led efforts to set a price cap for oil from Russia, a plan the US had suggested as a way to limit money flowing into the country and being put towards military use. Opec members defended their decision as a response to significant ""uncertainty"" about future demand for oil, amid fears that the global economy is heading towards a recession. ""The decision is technical, not political,"" United Arab Emirates Energy Minister Suhail al-Mazroui told reporters as Opec+ members gathered in Vienna to discuss the plans. Analysis by Sameer Hashmi, Middle East business correspondent  The latest decision by Opec+ is not just significant for oil markets, but for geopolitics as well.  The fact that the Saudi-led cartel has taken this decision just three months after President Joe Biden's controversial trip to Saudi Arabia to convince the kingdom's de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, to pump more barrels to cool down prices is a huge blow for the White House.  The move not only carries the risk of pushing up oil prices but will also damage efforts by the West to restrict the Russian oil income used to sustain its war in Ukraine. Many countries will see this as a clear indication of major oil producers, especially Saudi Arabia, siding with Russia in the name of protective oil market management.   It appears that the decision had support across the group as the Opec+ energy ministers approved the proposal in a meeting that lasted 30 minutes.  As far as oil markets go, even though this is a substantial reduction, the actual impact on global supplies on the ground would be smaller because several members of Opec+ are already pumping far below their official quotas.  But that may not be enough to calm the sentiments of the oil markets in the coming days. Higher oil prices were a major driver of the increase in consumer prices that hit countries around the world earlier this year, pushing inflation rates to levels not seen in decades and raising political tensions.  The more recent drop had provided some relief to consumers, even as prices of many other staples, including food, continue to rise. A barrel of Brent Crude oil was trading at $84.06 in late September - down from highs of about $130 this spring. Despite falling oil prices and concerns about the global economy, Caroline Bain, chief commodities economist for research firm Capital Economics, said it was unusual timing to slash supply. ""Global oil stocks are historically low and, so far, high prices have failed to materially dent demand,"" she added. Analysts said that the impact of the cuts is likely to be less significant than its size might suggest, since some countries were already producing less than they had said they would, with Capital predicting a 1% drop in global supplies as a result. Kathleen Brooks, director at Minerva Analysis, said the output cut was the ""worst case scenario people were looking for"" - one that would weigh on UK financial markets and raise fears that prices across the economy would continue to rise. It ""changes the narrative in terms of peak inflation - we might not be there yet,"" she said."
geopolitical tensions,Suspected Chinese spy balloon tracked across US,2024-09-15,2023-02-02,By Max Matza,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-64507225,"The US is tracking a suspected Chinese surveillance balloon that has been spotted flying over sensitive sites in recent days. Defence officials said they were confident the ""high-altitude surveillance balloon"" belonged to China. It was most recently seen above the western state of Montana. The military decided against shooting it down in case debris falls. China warned against speculation and ""hype"" until the facts are verified. The object flew over Alaska's Aleutian Islands and through Canada before appearing over the city of Billings in Montana on Wednesday, US officials said. A senior defence official said the government prepared fighter jets, including F-22s, in case the White House ordered the object to be shot down. Canada said on Friday that it was monitoring ""a potential second incident"" involving a surveillance balloon, but did not say which country could be behind it. It said in the statement that it is working closely with the US to ""safeguard Canada's sensitive information from foreign intelligence threats"".   Top military leaders, including Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin and General Mark Milley, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, met on Wednesday to assess the threat. Mr Austin was travelling in the Philippines at the time. Montana, a sparsely populated state, is home to one of only three nuclear missile silo fields in the country, at Malmstrom Air Force Base, and the official said the apparent spy craft was flying over sensitive sites to collect information. But the military leaders advised against taking ""kinetic action"" against the balloon because of the danger that falling debris might pose to people on the ground.  Officials refrained from giving information about the exact size of the balloon, but described it as ""sizeable"", with reports of pilots being able to see it, even from a distance. US media have reported another US official comparing it to the size of three buses.  The defence department, however, said there was no ""significantly enhanced threat"" of US intelligence being compromised, because American officials ""know exactly where this balloon is and exactly where it's passing over"". And there was also no threat to civilian aviation as the balloon was ""significantly"" above the altitude used by commercial airlines.  The statement added that the balloon is unlikely to give much more information than China can already collect using satellites. The US had raised the matter with Chinese officials in their embassy in Washington DC and in Beijing, officials added. China's foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said Beijing is currently attempting to verify the reports of the surveillance balloon, adding that ""until the facts are clear, making conjectures and hyping up the issue will not help to properly resolve it"". ""China is a responsible country and always abides strictly by international law. We have no intention of violating the territory or airspace of any sovereign country,"" she said. During Thursday's briefing at the Pentagon, officials declined to disclose the aircraft's current location and did not give information on where it was launched from.  They added that such surveillance balloons had been tracked in the past several years, but this one was ""appearing to hang out for a longer period of time this time around"". It confused social media users in Montana, with some posting images of a pale round object high in the sky. Others reported seeing US military planes in the area, apparently monitoring the object. Billings office worker Chase Doak told the Associated Press news agency that he noticed the ""big white circle in the sky"" and went home to get a better camera.  ""I thought maybe it was a legitimate UFO,"" he said. ""So I wanted to make sure I documented it and took as many photos as I could."" Chinese state media site the Global Times accused the US of aggravating tensions between China and the US by frequently creating a Cold War atmosphere. It is also being widely discussed on Chinese social media, with many amused at the reported use of balloons for surveillance. ""We have so many satellites, why would we need to use a balloon,"" wrote one user on Weibo. Senator Marco Rubio, the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, slammed China's alleged balloon. ""The level of espionage aimed at our country by Beijing has grown dramatically more intense & brazen over the last 5 years,"" he tweeted. Montana Governor Greg Gianforte, a Republican, said in a statement that he had been briefed on the ""deeply troubling"" situation. Speaking at an unrelated event in Washington DC on Thursday, CIA Director William Burns made no mention of the balloon, but called China the ""biggest geopolitical challenge"" currently facing the US. The alleged spy craft is likely to increase tensions ahead of US Secretary of State Antony Blinken's visit to China next week. It will be the first visit to the country by a Biden administration cabinet secretary. The top US diplomat will be in Beijing to hold talks on a wide range of issues, including security, Taiwan and Covid-19. He will also meet Chinese President Xi Jinping, the the Financial Times reported on Thursday. Balloons are one of oldest forms of surveillance technology. Compared to other air surveillance devices, they can be operated cheaply without personnel, while remaining airborne for long periods of time. "
geopolitical tensions,Suppressing China won't make US great - Beijing,2024-09-15,2023-03-07,By Kelly Ng,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-64871808,"China's foreign minister says China-US relations have ""seriously deviated"" while warning of potential conflict. ""Containment and suppression will not make America great. It will not stop the rejuvenation of China,"" said Qin Gang.  Mr Qin, China's former ambassador to the US, held his first press conference as foreign minister on Tuesday. The spy balloon saga has heightened tensions between the superpowers despite recent efforts to improve ties.  ""It [the US] regards China as its primary rival and the most consequential geopolitical challenge. This is like the first button in the shirt being put wrong,"" said Mr Qin, speaking on the sidelines of the annual meeting of China's parliament in Beijing.  The foreign minister was responding to a question on whether a healthy China-US relationship was still possible as differences between the countries grew. The US called for establishing ""guardrails"", but what it really wants is for China to not hit back with words or actions when provoked, Mr Qin added.  He was referring to US President Joe Biden's comments last month that the US would ""compete fully with China but [is] not looking for conflict"".  Mr Qin said: ""If the US does not put on the brakes and continues to roar down the wrong road, no amount of guardrails can stop the derailment and overturning, and it is bound to fall into conflict and confrontation. Who will bear its disastrous consequences?""  He also said the diplomatic crisis caused by the balloon incident could have been averted but the US acted with ""the presumption of guilt"".  Washington has previously described the suspected spy balloon as a ""clear violation of US sovereignty"". Beijing admitted the object belonged to them, but said it was a civilian airship blown off-course.  Spy Balloons: Are They Really A Threat? The BBC's Gordon Corera breaks down what we know about spy balloons Watch now on BBC iPlayer (UK only) Relations between the two countries deteriorated during former US President Donald Trump's administration, which launched a trade war against China in 2018. The two superpowers continue to clash on various issues, including Taiwan, China's militarisation of the South China Sea and the origins of Covid. Mr Qin's comments follow Chinese President Xi Jinping's unusually direct rebuke of the US on Monday. Mr Xi said ""Western countries led by the US had implemented all-round containment, encirclement and suppression"" against China and that this brought ""severe challenges"" to the country. On Tuesday, Mr Qin said an ""invisible hand"" was driving the Ukraine crisis but did not name any country or individual. He reiterated that China had not provided weapons to either side of the Russia-Ukraine war and called for peace talks to resume. However, he asked: ""Why should the US demand that China refrain from supplying arms to Russia when it sells arms to Taiwan?"" The Ukraine crisis has reached a ""critical juncture"", he said. ""Either a ceasefire will stop the war, restore peace and embark on a political settlement, or fuel the fire, expand the crisis and drag it into the abyss of losing control."" Mr Qin, 56, was named China's foreign minister in December 2022 and is one of the youngest appointees to this post in the country's history. He replaced Wang Yi, who was promoted to the politburo of the ruling Communist Party in October that year. A trusted aide of Chinese President Xi Jinping, Mr Qin is well known as a tough-talking diplomat. "

US Secretary of State Hilary Clinton will also join the meeting in Phnom Penh later in the week. ""The fact that the world is more interested and attentive and taking the issue more seriously is precisely because this region of the world has become more important to the world,"" Surin Pitsuwan, Asean secretary general, told the BBC.    ""They don't want it to be derailed - they don't want conflict that would affect the growth trajectory of this region of the world."" Mrs Clinton, who will be leading a trade delegation, has called for ''progress'' on a code of conduct for the South China Sea, signalling the United States' interest in the geopolitical tension in the region. Speaking to reporters in Tokyo on Sunday, she urged China and Asean nations ""to resolve their disputes without coercion, without intimidation, without threats and without conflict"". China's Foreign Ministry said on Monday that it was willing to discuss the code of conduct. ""When conditions are ripe China would like to discuss with Asean countries the formulation of the COC [code of conduct],"" spokesman Liu Weimin said. ""But I want to stress that the COC is not aimed at resolving disputes, but aimed at building mutual trust and deepening cooperation."" The Philippines has been leading the charge for Asean to pressure China to accept the code of conduct. A maritime stand-off between China and the Philippines developed in a reef area known as the Scaborough Shoal in April, with China denying reports it was preparing for war at the height of the tension in May. Both sides accused the other of intruding into territorial waters. Vietnam was also angered by a recent call from China for oil exploration bids in disputed territory.  China has overlapping territorial claims with several Asean members - the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei - in the resource rich area. But Asean's members are divided over what to do. The four affected countries want action but others, like Cambodia, are grateful recipients of Chinese aid and investment, and reluctant to rock the boat, says the BBC's Guy DeLauney.  Asean was set up in 1967 by founder members Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Singapore.

geopolitical tensions,US to ban American investments in China tech sector,2024-09-15,2023-08-09,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-66454313,"The US will ban American investment in some areas of China's high-tech sector, including artificial intelligence, adding to strained relations between the two superpowers.  US firms will also be asked to disclose what investments they make in China in high-tech sectors.  The much-anticipated move gives the US government new power to screen foreign dealings by private companies.  The US said the measure would be narrowly targeted. However, it is poised to further chill economic relations between the world's two largest economies. China said it was ""very disappointed"". The US ""has continuously escalated suppression and restrictions on China,"" said Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Washington. He added that White House claims that the US was not seeking to hurt China's economy or separate the two countries did not match its actions. ""We urge the US side to honour its words."" The order by US President Biden formally kicks off the push to craft rules to bar American businesses from investing in firms from ""countries of concern"" that are active in quantum computing, advanced semiconductors and certain areas of artificial intelligence.  The government will also require US firms to notify the Treasury Department of investments in firms working on a wider range of artificial intelligence and semiconductor technology.  The rules are not expected to apply to so-called portfolio investments, in which firms invest passively in companies via the stock market, but are focused on active investments made by private equity, venture capital and other firms.  They will now enter a public comment period, which is expected to further clarify what kinds of investments are off-limits. The rules are not expected to go into effect for months.  In a briefing with reporters, senior administration officials said the measure was a ""national security action, not an economic one"". They said the US remained committed to open investment. Sarah Bauerle Danzman, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, said the approach outlined on Wednesday was narrower than some of the other proposals under debate, but still represented an ""unprecedented"" expansion of government oversight. ""It is definitely a big deal and it certainly represents quite a break from past policy,"" she said.  Controls on outbound investment are rare among advanced economies, currently present only in Japan and Korea, according to a 2022 report by the US-China Investment project.   In the US, prior restrictions on China trade have relied on limiting sales of sensitive technology by US firms and screening Chinese investments in American companies. The Trump administration has also barred investments in firms tied to China's military.  The latest measure has widespread support in Washington, where it is seen as fixing a regulatory gap concerning financial flows that risks allowing American money and know-how to to flow into China and assist its military ambitions. The US has been trying to build international support for the investment curbs with some signs of success.  Prime Minister Rishi Sunak in May said the government would consider curbs on outbound investment; the European Commission put forward a proposal focused on investments in sensitive technologies earlier this summer.  It is not clear how significantly the order would affect flows of investment.  China was the number two destination for foreign investment in 2022, behind the US, but many reports suggest money flowing into the country from the US and elsewhere has dropped sharply as geopolitical relations sour.  In the UK, a recent survey by the Institute of Directors found that one in five UK importers had already switched investments away from the country due to geopolitical tensions.  The value of US foreign direct investment transactions in China dropped to roughly $8bn last year, the lowest level in nearly two decades, according to the Rhodium Group. China has responded to the curbs with its own rules, including limits on exports of some critical minerals used to make computer chips. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who visited China in July to try to ease tensions, said last month she did not think the coming curbs would have a fundamental impact on the investment climate in the country.  But Ms Bauerle Danzman, a professor of international studies at Indiana University, said despite US efforts to target its restrictions, the ill-defined nature of some of the technologies in question, many of which also have consumer uses, means the clampdown risks becoming too broad. She warned that could ultimately hurt the US, by raising costs for businesses and isolating the country from technological advances.  ""Whether this is good or bad is going to depend on implementation,"" she said.

A flurry of cabinet meetings, consultations and developments since the formation of Lebanon's latest government has highlighted key weaknesses in the country's economy. With a 152% debt to GDP ratio, Lebanon is the third most indebted country in the world after Japan and Greece. Interest payments consume almost half of government revenues, crippling public finances. A public sector wage increase in 2017 and higher interest rates have added to the budget deficit.  Huge costs in Lebanon's post-war reconstruction were a leading precursor to today's financial problems. Achievements evidently favoured the country's rich and mostly focused on gleaming property developments in the capital, Beirut. Sectors such as transport and energy need urgent overhauling - especially Lebanon's infamous electricity infrastructure. With the country unable to meet local demand for decades now and resorting to rationing electricity, most citizens use back-up generators for several hours during daily national blackouts. At the beginning of February, Lebanese President Michel Aoun said he would make this a major priority. In fact, the grid is in such a desperate situation that it has been used as a bargaining chip by Hezbollah's regional allies, Syria and Iran.  Iran's ambassador to Lebanon, Mohammad Jalal Firouznia, said in February that ""Iran was prepared to provide all the help that Lebanon needs, whether in terms of electricity, medication, or protecting Lebanon from the aggressor [Israel]"". After eight years of civil war and massive destruction of its own infrastructure, Syria sold electricity intermittently to Lebanon in 2017 and 2018, while at the same time blocking efforts by Jordan, a country which enjoys a surplus in electricity production, from selling power to Lebanon. On 8 April, after a round of highly publicised meetings, the Lebanese government unanimously approved an electricity reform plan. Prime Minister Hariri told reporters: ""This plan satisfies the Lebanese people because it will guarantee electricity 24 hours a day, which will reduce the budget deficit."" Steps towards fixing the power sector are viewed as a critical test of the government's will to forge ahead with long-delayed reforms that would help Lebanon unlock $11bn (£8.5bn) in funding pledged by donors last year at a key investment conference in Paris. The Lebanese government is relying on oil and gas reserves in the Mediterranean to fuel a bright future, opening up tenders to companies such as France's Total and Russia's Novatek for offshore drilling. A deep mistrust of politicians, an absence of a functioning government for long periods of time and ongoing geopolitical disputes have hampered these efforts. While Lebanon's hydrocarbon wealth is promising, it is still far behind the progress of its neighbours. In January, energy ministers from Cyprus, Egypt, Greece, Jordan and Israel, with representatives from Italy and the Palestinian Authority, met in Cairo to discuss regional co-operation in offshore gas. In addition, various export options and pipelines between some of those countries are already being advanced. War in Syria has aggravated weaknesses in the Lebanese economy. Nearly 1.5 million Syrian refugees were displaced to Lebanon at the height of the war according to Lebanese government statistics - nearly one quarter of the population. The additional strain further compounded existing issues in public services such as education, healthcare and the national grid. Financing Lebanon's deficit also depends heavily on critical transfers it receives from its large diaspora. In October 2018, the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace reported that the marked drop in remittances from Lebanese nationals in the Gulf had pushed the country further into debt. Worsening prospects in the Gulf region and lower oil prices have affected significant numbers of Lebanese expatriates in oil-producing Gulf states. In 2018, the World Bank linked the issue to the November 2017 crisis between Lebanon and Saudi Arabia which involved claims that Prime Minister Hariri was being held captive and forced to resign.  The situation quickly escalated and Riyadh threatened to expel Lebanese nationals working in the kingdom. Tensions remained high even after Mr Hariri and his family were able to leave Saudi Arabia. Lebanese workers in the Gulf contribute nearly one-fifth of Lebanon's GDP, making them a vital source of the deposits that banks use to finance more debt. About 400,000 Lebanese nationals - half of them in Saudi Arabia - contributed between 43% and 60% of total remittances in 2015.  However, total remittances dropped by 7% in 2017. The decline is further exacerbated by Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 which undertakes unprecedented economic restructuring to create jobs for Saudis, including measures to encourage the replacement of foreign labour. Cabinet efforts to pass an austerity budget to meet the criteria to unlock billions of dollars of pledges by overseas donors have alarmed some segments of society. Many are worried about potential cuts to pensions and state interference in the country's sophisticated banking system.  On 30 April, military veterans protested against anticipated reductions to their pensions. On the same day, the General Confederation of Lebanese Workers (CGTL) called for a three-day strike to protest against anticipated austerity measures in this year's budget, the state-run NNA news agency reported. The union urged people to join protests against ""infringements to public workers' salaries"". The strikes affected several institutions including the Port of Beirut, the National Social Security Fund, Electricity of Lebanon (EDL) and Ogero Telecom. On 8 May, the CGTL called the protests off after President Aoun informed the union that an article of the 2019 budget law relating to potential cuts to employees' salaries had been suspended ""until the situation of each sector, one-by-one, is studied in co-ordination with relevant ministries"", according to union leader Bechara Asmar.  The previous day, central bank employees announced a temporary halt to their strike. As Mr Hariri tried to appease the various groups, he vowed to push through economic reforms. ""Lebanon is far from bankruptcy,"" he said. The latest wave of protests began on 17 October. Anger spilled over into the streets in major cities across the country over a government proposal to charge $6 for the use of WhatsApp and other VOIP apps. The government has since scrapped the plan but protesters have remained on the streets in large numbers.

geopolitical tensions,JFK's mother on the loss of her son,2024-09-15,2023-11-22,Myles Burke,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20231121-jfk-assassination-john-f-kennedys-mother-roses-agony-and-ecstasy-on-the-tragic-loss-of-her-son-60-years-ago,"To mark the 60th anniversary of JFK's death, revisit an exclusive BBC interview with the US president's mother, Rose, who movingly details the family's intense pride and sorrow. ""I'm an optimist. When I first heard it, I thought maybe it was just an accident, or a slight… slight sort of thing,"" says Rose Kennedy, grief still etched on her face as she reflects on hearing the news that her son John F Kennedy had been shot in Dallas in 1963. ""But then Bobby [Kennedy, JFK's younger brother] telephoned and said it was serious, and then events moved very quickly."" More like this: - JFK's death: One of the US's biggest mysteries - The 'alien invasion' that fooled the US - How Mickey Mouse saved Disney from ruin In this exclusive BBC clip from 1973, recorded to mark the 10th anniversary of her son's death, Rose speaks with poise and restraint. It was not the first horrific tragedy she had faced: her eldest son, Joe Jr, had been killed in action during World War Two; her daughter, Kathleen, in a plane crash in 1948. And just five years after JFK's fatal shooting, she was bereaved again, when her son, Democratic presidential candidate Robert died at the hands of an assassin. In this moving clip, she describes the pride she felt as Kennedy's mother at his inauguration, coupled with her intense grief upon his death, as: ""the agony and the ecstasy of Michelangelo: we've had these ecstatic moments – and these tragic ones"". The profound loss Rose felt at her son John's death would be reflected by the shock and grief that would play out across the US, to the extent that a whole generation would be able to remember exactly where they were when they heard that he had been shot. In the frantic police investigation following the shooting, Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested as the prime suspect, but before he could stand trial, he was shot and killed by nightclub owner Jack Ruby, leaving many unanswered questions. The circumstances of JFK's death have captivated the public's imagination, and new details about the assassination continue to come to light. In December 2022, US President Joe Biden ordered the release of thousands of unedited government files about the murder, and this year a book by a former Secret Service agent – who witnessed the president's death at close range – cast doubt on the conclusion by the Warren Commission, the 1964 US government inquiry into the killing, that Lee Harvey Oswald had been the sole gunman. Presidential hopes Born in 1917, JFK was raised in a wealthy, politically-connected family of Irish Catholics in Boston. He was one of nine close-knit, boisterous children, and his father, Joe, fostered an atmosphere of intellectual and physical competition among his offspring. The second oldest son, John was pushed to excel from an early age. After studying at Harvard, and writing a best-selling book while he was there, he volunteered his services to the US Armed Forces, and saw combat in the South Pacific during World War Two, winning a medal for heroism for leading his comrades to safety after their boat was sunk. In History In History is a series which uses the BBC's unique audio and video archive to explore historical events that still resonate today JFK initially hoped to pursue a career in journalism or teaching. His father had groomed his older brother, Joe Jr, to run for political office but he was killed in combat in 1944. So, when JFK was discharged from the Navy the following year, he took up his father's presidential hopes. Energetic and eloquent, he proved adept at the task, first getting elected to the US House of Representatives in 1946, followed by a successful bid for the US Senate six years later. In 1960, he set his sights on the White House. Standing as the Democratic candidate, he faced off against Republican Richard Nixon in an unprecedented series of TV debates that proved to be the highlight of the campaign. Telegenic and clearly at ease in front of the camera, he seemed a forward-thinking politician who resonated with the youthful idealism that was growing in the aftermath of World War Two. He narrowly won the election, becoming the youngest US president in history at the age of 43, as well as the first Roman Catholic. In his inaugural address, he laid out a bold vision for collective action and civic duty with his famous words: ""Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country."" This set the tone for his presidency with a stated commitment to civil rights, scientific advancement and international diplomacy. He established the Peace Corps, enabling young Americans to volunteer to work in developing nations, and he set an ambitious goal to put a man on the Moon by the end of the 1960s. He also advocated strongly for African Americans' equal rights, sending federal troops to enforce desegregation at the University of Mississippi. But his presidency was also framed by the intense geopolitical tension between the US and the Soviet Bloc when he came to power, much of which would play out over the island of Cuba. First when in 1961, he approved an easily defeated CIA plan to land Cuban exiles at the Bay of Pigs to overthrow the communist government. And then with the Cuban Missile Crisis, where the discovery of Soviet forces building silos for missiles on the island, triggered a tense standoff that brought the world to the brink of nuclear war. JFK as a president chimed with a generation who believed the future could be better, and were eager to actively participate in shaping it. He invited cameras into his life and that of his young family in a way that made people feel they knew him. His presidency seemed to hold immense promise and potential. When his life was cut short so shockingly, it sparked a wave of grief and mourning that left an indelible mark on the consciousness of the nation.

geopolitical tensions,US holds interest rates steady at 22-year high,2024-09-15,2023-11-01,By Faarea Masud,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-67290817,"The US central bank has held its key interest rate at its current 22-year high as it seeks to stabilise price rises, which had recently reached near-record levels. The Federal Reserve's rate target remains at 5.25%-5.5%. The bank has been raising borrowing costs with the hope of cooling the economy and slowing inflation, the rate at which prices rise. It comes after recent data showed the US economy grew faster than expected. Raising interest rates is one mechanism that central banks can use to tackle inflation. The theory is that by raising interest rates and making it more expensive to borrow, consumers will spend less and that would lead to slower price rises. The bank had faced criticism, with some suggesting that holding interest rates at higher levels could put the US economy at risk of entering a recession. But the economy grew by a better-than-expected 4.9% from July to September. The figure was a big jump from the previous three months and was buoyed by a tight jobs market and increased consumer spending. In a statement on Wednesday, the Federal Reserve said that the vote in favour of holding rates was unanimous, adding that it was prepared to adjust its policy ""as appropriate"" if risks emerge. It said that holding the rate would give the bank time to ""assess additional information"" on how the economy is performing. Its chair Jerome Powell said a few months of good data on the economy are ""only the beginning of building confidence"" that inflation was moving towards its target.  He said that there was still a ""long way to go"", and said that he understood that high inflation causes ""hardship"" as it erodes spending power for consumers.  He said that he understood the Fed's previous run of rate rises was affecting communities and businesses, but that the rate of price rises still remain well above its target. It signals that the central bank may delay lowering interest rates, as inflation currently stands at 3.7% in the US, which is still above the Fed's target of 2%. Independent US economic analyst Peter Jankovskis told the BBC that the rate hold was ""no great surprise"" with ""no immediate impact on stocks"".  He added that ""elevated long-term bond yields"" also contributed to the Fed's decision. The yield on long-term government bonds is a key indicator of how investors perceive the strength of the US economy. Chairman Powell also said that there were ""significant issues"" the central bank had to take into account.  ""Global geopolitical tensions are elevated, including Ukraine"", he said, adding that the Fed was watching the Israel-Gaza situation for its ""economic implications"" and ""proceeding carefully"" given the risks faced globally. But Mr Jankovskis said: ""It appears that the Fed sees the economy as strong and is focused on whether additional rate increases might be needed. Higher for longer remains the theme."" In many economies, higher borrowing costs have led to more expensive loans for businesses, homes and other goods and services, with the end of an era of low-cost borrowing. Similarly in the UK, households have seen their budgets squeezed by higher mortgage payments or borrowing costs. The Bank of England is widely expected to hold its current interest rate when it announces its next decision on Thursday.  The rate was left unchanged in September, ending a run of 14 consecutive rises."
geopolitical tensions,Why are Autumn Statement tax cuts looking more likely?,2024-09-15,2023-11-21,By Faisal Islam,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-67473404,"It looks like the Autumn Statement will now include at least one crowd-pleasing personal tax cut - so why the change of message and which tax could be cut? When I spoke to Jeremy Hunt 10 days ago, just after it was confirmed that the UK economy was not growing, I suggested to him that personal tax cuts might help. He said there were ""no shortcuts"" and clearly signalled that his focus was on growth-enhancing business tax cuts. He'd previously declared personal tax cuts ""virtually impossible"". A week on, I spoke to the chancellor again, at a hydrogen energy facility in Sheffield. The caution on such cuts had gone. And the prime minster has now suggested the time has come to cut tax. For Rishi Sunak, last Wednesday's drop in inflation was a clear turning point in Britain's recent economic story. During his time as chancellor and as prime minister - most of the past four years - the UK and most of the world have been hit by an unprecedented series of geopolitical crises that have led to big spending and rolling inflationary shocks. The pandemic led to an inflationary supply chain crisis pushing prices up, and then the Russia-Ukraine conflict saw the double whammy of the world's biggest energy exporter invading one of the world's biggest food exporters. At this precise time, the size of Britain's workforce was hit. In part, this was due to the aftermath of the pandemic, and in some key sectors, by more restrictive post-Brexit worker visas. It was a potent cocktail for inflation. The government's argument therefore, is that last week's confirmation that inflation has more than halved since its peak is a turning point for inflation. The UK is on a glidepath to normal inflation levels, and therefore, they argue, there is little risk of a personal tax cut adding to price pressures. But the PM's argument goes further. He says that the 4.6% inflation figure also represents a turning point of a rolling series of economic crises since 2020. The time to put four years of higher public spending, borrowing, and taxation behind us. He is taking aim at Labour's calls for a ""new"" post-pandemic world of more resilient local supply chains, and more borrowing-funded public spending especially on green infrastructure. US President Joe Biden may be able to do this because the US has the privilege of printing the world's reserve currency, and is insulated from fears about its debts. The UK, especially after last year's mini budget, cannot do this, Mr Sunak argued. This will be the dividing line of the next year with a Labour Party that aims to spend £28bn a year more on public investment by the end of the coming Parliament. So the tax cuts will be part of a general message that, having seen inflation halve, now the focus is on growth. The overwhelming focus of the cuts will be aimed at helping businesses to invest. But, a tax cut that helps ""make work pay"" and so improves the supply of workers, helping relieve a key constraint on growth, will also be delivered. National Insurance seems to fit the bill, because it directly helps employers or workers keep more from wage packets. Another option is ironing out some of the inconsistencies in the tax system that see some universal credit recipients, working parents and higher earners facing effective tax rates so high that it makes little sense to work more hours. Former pensions minister Steve Webb has also spotted his old department seeming to prepare an unusual announcement on benefit uprating on an obscure part of the Department for Work and Pensions website. When setting how much benefits go up next April, the government could decide to use October's lower inflation figure instead of the usual September figure. That could squeeze between £2bn and £3bn from the welfare bill every year. Both the PM and chancellor make the argument that the level of benefits may exacerbate worker shortage problems. In Westminster, others point out that the loss of the Supreme Court case on a plan to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda, on the same day as the inflation figure, may also help explain the search for a headline personal tax cut to assuage his backbenchers. The speech the PM gave on Monday, when he said the government was now able to cut taxes, was due to be given last Wednesday, before the Supreme Court's ruling. So the contours of the argument this week will be the government arguing that an economic turnaround has created space for a tax cut, and the opposition will instead say the PM is jumping the gun at the behest of backbenchers and in any case only reversing one of two dozen tax rises. In making a turnaround argument, it is worth waiting for what the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) says in its forecasts for the economy. This month's Bank of England forecasts for quarterly growth next year are 0.01%, -0.04%, 0.01% and 0.02%. Over 2024, it adds up to zero. The economy did avoid the recession predicted for this year, but how seriously can Downing Street proclaim a turnaround if the OBR predicts little or no growth over the next year? It is also worth watching on what basis the government claims the PM's target on growth will be met. So underneath a big call made on tax cuts at the Autumn Statement, there is a much wider, immediate political argument, and the outline of choice for the general election. But watch out for whether the OBR supports this ""turnaround"" picture. What help would you like from the Autumn Statement? Do you have any questions you want answering?

geopolitical tensions,German navy chief resigns over Ukraine comments,2024-09-15,2022-01-22,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-60099924,"The head of the German navy has resigned over controversial comments he made over Ukraine.  Kay-Achim Schönbach said the idea that Russia wanted to invade Ukraine was nonsense. He added that all President Vladimir Putin wanted was respect.  A number of countries have supplied weapons to Ukraine, including the US and UK. But Germany has refused Ukraine's request for ammunition.  Russia has denied claims that it is planning to invade Ukraine.  But President Putin has issued demands to the West which he says concern Russia's security, including that Ukraine be stopped from joining the military defence alliance Nato.  He also wants Nato to abandon military exercises and stop sending weapons to eastern Europe, seeing this as a direct threat to Russia's security. Meanwhile, the UK has accused Mr Putin of plotting to install a pro-Moscow figure to lead Ukraine's government. Mr Schönbach said on Saturday that he had resigned from his role ""with immediate effect"" in order to ""avert further damage"".  He made the controversial comments while speaking at a think-tank discussion in India on Friday and the video was later published to social media.  In the video, Mr Schönbach said Mr Putin needed to be treated as an equal by the West.  ""It is easy to give him the respect he really demands - and also probably deserves,"" he said.  He added that the Crimean peninsula, which Russia annexed in 2014, ""is gone and will never come back"".  Ukraine's foreign ministry described Mr Schönbach's comments as ""categorically unacceptable"".  The head of Nato has warned there is a real risk of a fresh conflict in Europe after an estimated 100,000 Russian troops amassed on the border.  Some 170 tonnes of US ""lethal aid"" arrived in Ukraine on Saturday and Sunday, and the UK announced earlier this week that it was sending defence weapons and extra troops for training. Several other Nato members are sending military equipment or deploying forces. Germany has refused to send weapons, instead offering to send Ukraine a field hospital. It has reportedly blocked attempts by Estonia to send Ukraine German-origin weapons, according to the Wall Street Journal.  Defence Minister Christine Lambrecht told Welt am Sonntag newspaper that Berlin had already delivered respirators to Ukraine and severely injured Ukrainian soldiers are being treated in German military hospitals.  Ukraine has denounced Germany's response, accusing Berlin of undermining Western unity by refusing to transfer weapons to Ukraine or allowing some of its allies to do so. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said in a series of posts on Twitter that Germany's stance encouraged Mr Putin to launch an attack.  In an interview with Sky News on Sunday, Ukraine's ambassador to the UK, Vadym Prystaiko, called on Germany to play a ""significant role"". ""If they're not ready to provide us with weapons, defensive weapons, OK, they might do something else which will help us,"" he said. Mr Prystaiko said he would ""absolutely"" like to see Germany block Russia's Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.  The pipeline runs from Russia to Germany under the Baltic Sea, and, if granted regulatory clearance, would increase Moscow's gas exports to Europe. The Ukrainian presidency has described it as a ""dangerous geopolitical weapon"". Approval for the project is currently being decided by Germany's energy regulator."
geopolitical tensions,BA owner IAG calls for action to restart flights,2024-09-15,2021-05-07,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-57019962,"British Airways owner IAG has said it is ""ready to fly"" and has called for government action to restart international travel. Citing a ""high level"" of pent-up demand, the airline group called for ""travel corridors without restrictions"" between certain countries. Some foreign holidays could be allowed when England's lockdown rules ease. Details of a ""green list"" of countries with the fewest travel rules are expected soon. The airline group has been hit hard by the coronavirus crisis, with revenue plunging as many of its planes have been grounded. IAG reported revenues of €968m (£840m) for the first three months of the year, down from €4.6bn for the same period last year, and an operating loss of €1,07bn. It repeated its call for digital health passes ""to enable a safe re-opening of our skies"". There will be some ""opening up"" of foreign travel on 17 May, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said. IAG - which also owns Iberia, Aer Lingus and Vueling - is ""doing everything in our power to emerge in a stronger competitive position,"" said Luis Gallego, IAG chief executive. ""We're absolutely confident that a safe re-start to travel can happen as shown by the scientific data."" But the aviation industry is anxiously awaiting details of the government's travel traffic light system, which is expected to be announced shortly. The traffic light system of rules will see countries classed as green, amber or red. Travellers to green countries will not need to isolate on their return, but they will need to take a Covid test. Arrivals from amber countries will need to quarantine, while red-list countries have the strictest rules, with only UK or Irish nationals allowed to return and they must pay to stay in a government quarantine hotel. ""We're ready to fly, but government action is needed through four key measures,"" said Mr Gallego. The measures the airline group demanded were: Meanwhile IAG increased its number of cargo-only flights in the three months to 1,306, up from 969 in the previous quarter. ""Cargo has enabled us to operate a more extensive passenger long-haul network,"" said Mr Gallego. ""It generated €350m in revenue, a record for quarter one."" Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that cargo offered ""relief"" to the airline, but the ""pain of lost passenger bookings is severe"". ""British Airways owner IAG is still in emergency mode, battening down the hatches as global travel remains in limbo pushing bookings to a fraction of usual levels,"" she said. But the airline group ""can do little but hold on tight through the continued turbulence and hope government policy will allow it navigate out of the crisis"".  ""But there are still threatening grey skies ahead, not least with the spiralling of cases in India which could knock confidence in the travelling public,"" Ms Streeter added.  Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor, said the airline sector was ""challenging"" even in normal circumstances. ""Volatile fuel costs, industrial action, geopolitical tensions, terrorism and the usual economic cycle are all headwinds which the industry faces.   ""The pandemic has for some brought an existential crisis. Yet the company is one which has dealt with an impossible situation as best it could,"" he said. Intercontinental Hotels Group is another travel industry firm banking on international travel reopening.  The hotel chain reported a 33.7% fall in first quarter revenue per available room compared to the same period last year, and a 50.6% slump compared to 2019.  But chief executive Keith Barr was upbeat about the group's prospects. He said there ""was a notable pick-up in demand in March, particularly in the US and China, which continued into April"". ""As the rollout of vaccines becomes more established, travel restrictions lift, and economic activity rebuilds, traveller demand will continue to grow and generate further momentum in an industry recovery over the course of the year,"" he said."
geopolitical tensions,A town split between two countries,2024-09-15,2017-11-06,Eric Weiner,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20171105-the-us-canada-border-runs-through-this-tiny-library,"The Haskell library straddles two nations, with one foot in the US and the other in Canada. Step into the Haskell Library and you’d easily mistake it for a typical small-town American library. Sure, it’s a bit more elegant, with original woodwork from 1905 and upholstered reading chairs but, still, a library like any other. Soon, though, questions nag. Why do the librarians toggle effortlessly between English and French? Why do the stacks contain so many books on French-Canadian history? And, most perplexing of all, what is that black line traversing the floor? The Haskell, it turns out, is a library like no other. It straddles two nations, with one foot in the US and the other in Canada. That black line running along the floor – a strip of masking tape – marks the international border, separating the towns Derby Line, Vermont, from Stanstead, Quebec. The front door, community bulletin board and children’s books are in the US; the remainder of the collection and the reading room is in Canada. You may also be interested in: • The US land lost in Canada • The strange US-Canada border dispute • The dessert that’s blocked at borders The tape looks worn. No wonder – it’s the source of endless attention. Not an hour goes by, according to Nancy Rumery, the library’s director, when visitors don’t pose for photos with the line. They pose while making faces, or while lying across the tape. They pose with Flat Stanley, a paper cut-out of the children’s book character. Some families queue on either side of the line, others in descending height order. Lately, Rumery has noticed something even odder: some visitors freeze before the black line, as if it were emitting an invisible force field. They’ve seen an internet rumour claiming it’s illegal to cross the line. In fact, it is encouraged. The library relishes its role as a sort of free-trade zone for humans, a reprieve from a border that, while not exactly the Korean DMZ, is no longer the loosey-goosey frontier of decades past. Why such a fascination, though, with an innocuous strip of black masking tape? Borders fascinate us, always have. There is something about the divide between two worlds that intrigues – and frightens. Let’s face it, borders can be scary. They hint at darkness and danger out there, on the other side. That is what makes the Haskell Library so refreshing. It refuses to cave to this fear. “A line on a map is supposed to separate us, supposed to be what divides us,” said Canadian Hal Newman. “But that is what makes the Haskell so spectacular. Yes, a border runs through the middle, yet it brings people together. How fantastic is that?” Newman is the former director of the adjoining Haskell Opera House, which also straddles the border. He calls it ‘the impossible room’, as in impossible that such a venue exists. The stage is in Canada, most of the seats in the US. The border, in fact, slices through some of those seats, making the Haskell “the only opera house in the world where you can have one cheek on both sides of the border,” he said. This is by design, not accident. The Haskell family purposefully built the library and opera house along the border more than a century ago to promote cross-border interaction and friendship. Managing a bi-national enterprise “is absolutely complex,” said Rumery, who, while Canadian, uses ‘we’ when referring to Canadians or Americans. There are international exchange rates to contend with (the library accepts both currencies; there are no fines, but they sell postcards and other mementos); and two sets of safety regulations (the library uses whichever is strictest). Going out to lunch requires crossing an international border (it’s easier to order in). Rumery must negotiate not only with readers hunting for the latest Stephen King novel but also with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, US Homeland Security, and the International Boundary Commission, among others. Then there was the time 15 years ago when the library wanted to install a new lift. The lift was in Canada, but bringing the crane, which was in the US, to that side – even for a few hours – meant paying hefty duties. The solution? Leave the crane on US soil and hoist the lift through Canadian airspace. “Sometimes I wish I worked for a plain old cinder block library,” Rumery said, but the mischievous twinkle in her eyes gave her away. She was only kidding. She wouldn’t want to work anywhere else. The library is more than a geographic curiosity; it is, in this age of geopolitical tension and talk of walls, a reminder that borders are fictions created by humans that are precisely as real, and as menacing, as we choose to make them. I’ve been visiting this stretch of borderland for years. The cottage I rent with Canadian friends represents something of a compromise; located in Vermont, but so close to Canada you can walk there – which is exactly what I did this summer. I also drove and cycled across the border, each time dutifully clearing US and Canadian customs and immigration. One sunny morning, though, I decided to do something different. I hopped into a kayak and paddled across the border, the boundary marked only by a small white obelisk perched on a tiny island in the middle of Lake Memphremagog. It was wrong, I knew, but also exhilarating. There is something deliciously delinquent about crossing an international border surreptitiously, even one as seemingly benign as the US-Canadian border. I had thrown shade on the Treaty of Westphalia, the 17th-Century accord that created the concept of modern nation-states that prevails to this day. Borders are not static places. They change with the mood on one, or both, sides of the line. The big change to this sleepy border crossing came after the attacks of 11 September 2001. Streets that traversed the border were closed to traffic. Large potted plants were installed in front of the library, a barrier that would have been unthinkable on 10 September. Today, a US Homeland Security vehicle sits outside the library’s entrance 24 hours a day. The biggest change, though, is the steady flow of asylum seekers – ‘northbounders’, as they’re known – from the US to Canada. “I remember one day I saw a van driving up a street on the US side and this family gets out and they run across the border,” Newman recalled. “It’s minus 20C outside and the kids are wearing flip-flops. I’ll never forget that.” People separated by the border arrange to meet at the library, embracing among the copies of Philip Roth and Robertson Davies. Among long-time residents here a strain of border nostalgia persists. Back in the day you could cross the border effortlessly. Back in the day, the customs agents knew your name and waved you through with a smile. Back in the day you wouldn’t think twice about crossing the border to get a slice of pizza. Back in the day – it isn’t said but understood – life was better. “I used to have as many Canadian friends as American friends,” said Buzzy Roy, the pharmacist at Brown’s Drug Store in Derby Line. “You didn’t think of them as Canadians or Americans. They were just friends. In our minds, the border didn’t exist.” Today, the two towns still share a water system but, aside from fond memories, not much else. The library and the adjoining opera house are the last places where residents regularly interact. Roy’s pharmacy occupies a precarious position, a sort of No Man’s Land between the US and Canada. Cars entering from Canada must drive about 100m before reaching the US customs and immigration post, which means that, while on US soil, they have yet to officially enter the country. The pharmacy stands in this gap. “It’s very confusing, very abnormal. You don’t see many borders like this,” he said, adding that occasionally people walk into his store not knowing which country they’re in. Derby Line, like many small towns, is hurting economically, as the boarded-up storefronts attest. Competition from big box stores is partly to blame, but so is the border, according to Roy. “Too much hassle for too little reward,” he said. Sometimes borders fuel the local economy, other times they starve it. Never are they neutral. “I can see the need for tightening the reins from 30 or 40 years ago, but some of the things they do are unnecessary,” said Brian Smith, a Vermont state representative who has lived virtually his entire life in Derby Line. Smith relayed a story about an 85-year-old Vermont man who drove to visit his Canadian girlfriend. When he returned, the US Homeland Security computers were down, so the agent – who knew the man – insisted he wait for an hour until they came back on line. “That’s ridiculous,” Smith said. “Canada is not our enemy.” True, but in recent years some have tried to exploit the border’s relative porousness. In 2011, a Montreal man was arrested for allegedly smuggling a rucksack filled with guns through the library’s restroom. (He was recently extradited to the US to face charges there.) It was a shock to the library staff; “a violation of sacred space,” Newman said. It also raised fears that, in the current climate, the library’s future is uncertain. Shuttering the library, though, wouldn’t happen without a fight, predicted Smith. “You would see citizen outrage,” he said. “On both sides of the border.” Join over three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.

geopolitical tensions,What is Eurovision really about?,2024-09-15,2014-10-21,Fiona Macdonald,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20140509-geopolitics-and-drag-queens,"The Eurovision Song Contest brings together world affairs and shiny pop. BBC Culture picks five of its more bizarre motifs. It’s the most watched music event in the world, and it combines geopolitics with trampolines, trapeze artists and men running on hamster wheels: this year’s Eurovision Song Contest reaches its final on Saturday night. So far, one entrant has faced a ""transphobic backlash”, while current tensions between Russia and Ukraine hit the stage in the first semi-final. The 17-year-old Tolmachevy twins, Russia’s selection, were booed by the audience; their song Shine features lyrics that hint perhaps at the situation in Ukraine: “Living on the edge / closer to the crime / cross the line a step at a time”. After the country’s pro-democracy revolution in 2005 Ukraine was awarded just two points by Russia, which had given its neighbour the maximum 12 points the year before. Yet away from world affairs, the contest – which has been running since 1956 – continues to provide show-stopping pop of a unique kind. BBC Culture has pored through the Eurovision archives to find key trends embodied by some of this year’s crop. Bearded ladies Who knew this could be a trend? Conchita Wurst’s selection for Austria this year, despite making headlines, is not the first time a woman with facial hair has graced the Eurovision stage. In 2008, France’s Sebastien Tellier came on stage in a golf cart clutching a transparent globe, accompanied by five bearded female backing singers. He placed 19th. Honourable mention for taking hirsute to the next level should go to Estonian band Winny Puhh for their 2013 Eurovision performance, with a death metal spin on Chewbacca. Accordions Among the folk instruments banged, rattled or strummed over the past decades – from cowbells to dulcimers – the accordion reigns supreme. This year, Germany’s entrants Elaiza are wheezing their way through a song that mixes ‘neo-folk’ with dirge. Some acts have subverted the instrument’s folky associations: in 2013, Greece brought together ska, punk and Rebetiko styles for a song alluding to the country’s debt crisis. In 2007, Ukraine’s Verka Serduckha came second with one of Eurovision’s most memorable acts ever. Heavy on rouge and sequinned epaulettes, the drag queen performed a song perhaps best described as ‘accordion rave’ alongside enthusiastic backing dancers in tin foil uniforms. Twins The Tolmachevy Sisters won Junior Eurovision in 2006, at the age of nine, and will appear on a giant seesaw with intertwined ponytails in an apparent effort to promote Russia’s softer side. They have illustrious predecessors: identical pair Jedward represented Ireland in 2011 and 2012, breaking through with Lipstick, which finished 8th, and repeating their aerial gymnastics – dressed as robot knights, complete with a fountain – for Waterline. Baffling lyrics Latvia didn’t make it through this year’s semi-final stage with their entry: called Bake A Cake, its profound insights into the human condition included the line ""I talked to a unicorn the other night… he did a moonwalk on the Milky Way"". While lyrics over the years have included Switzerland’s ""When Djambo Djambo plays his barrel organ, children call it circus in the streets"" and Serbia’s “My old shoe, it saw half of the world”, arguably nothing can beat France’s 1961 entry – Jean-Paul Mauric, who chirpily chanted “bing et bong, et bing et bong” to describe animals’ spring awakening after hibernation. Strange props Ukraine’s choice of a human hamster wheel is far down on the list of strangest props in Eurovision history. Peter, Sue & Marc – of Djambo Djambo fame – represented Switzerland four times, in four different languages (French, English, German and Italian). Their 1979 attempt, Trödler & Co, featured bin bags, hoses and a watering can; a collection that baffled immigration officials who refused them entry to that year’s Eurovision host nation, Israel. Eventually allowed in, they finished 10th – this clip reveals an ingenious application of cake slices and a drum-kit rubbish bin.

geopolitical tensions,What is behind Turkey's staunch support for Hamas in Gaza?,2024-09-15,2024-01-02,By Ece Goksedef,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-67861266,"On the first day of the year, tens of thousands of Turks poured on to the streets of Istanbul, chanting ""Murderer Israel, get out of Palestine"". It was not the first massive pro-Palestinian rally in Turkey since the start of Israel-Gaza war on 7 October. But Monday's mass protest followed incendiary remarks by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.  Since he first came to power more than 20 years ago, Turkey has been a staunch supporter of the Palestinians, including Hamas. But even by Mr Erdogan's standards, the rhetoric was extreme. What Israel's prime minister was doing in Gaza, he said, ""is not any less than what Hitler did"". Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu hit back, saying ""Erdogan, who commits genocide against the Kurds, who holds a world record for imprisoning journalists who oppose his rule, is the last person who can preach morality to us"". Mr Erdogan has made comparisons with Nazi Germany in the past, but the current war of words has put into sharp focus just how bitter Turkish-Israeli relations have become, just months after a significant upturn. In the latest broadside against Israel, Turkey announced on Tuesday that it had detained 33 people suspected of working for Israeli intelligence service Mossad in raids across eight provinces.  The operation, carried out with Turkey's MIT intelligence agency, followed reports that Israel intended to hunt down members of Hamas abroad, including in Turkey. Turkey has stepped up support for Gaza since 7 October, for example bringing dozens of patients from Gaza to Turkey for treatment. Turkey's health minister himself accompanied the casualties en route from Egypt. When Hamas attacked Israel, Mr Erdogan used relatively measured language, urging both sides to remain calm. But as Israel's military response intensified, his rhetoric became increasingly fierce, calling Hamas ""freedom fighters"" and Israel's actions ""genocide"". This hostility to Israel plays to President Erdogan's support base in Turkey, says Helin Sari Ertem, Associate Professor of International Relations at Istanbul Medeniyet University.  ""Palestine has long been a cause for Turkey and the Turkish people, covering almost all political tendencies,"" she says. ""Consequently, it is not possible for Turkish governments to consider the Palestine-Israeli conflict only as a foreign policy issue; as it definitely is a game-changer in domestic politics."" In the second half of the 20th Century, Israel and Turkey enjoyed close economic and strategic relationships. Turkey was also the first country in the region to formally recognise Israel after it was founded. But it was not long after Recep Tayyip Erdogan came to office in 2002 that relations with Israel deteriorated while those with Hamas improved. In 2006, then-Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal visited Turkey following an invitation from Mr Erdogan. Hamas had by then been designated a terrorist group by Israel, the US and the EU, amongst others. The first diplomatic crisis between Israel and Turkey played out before a world audience when in 2009, Mr Erdogan stormed out of a meeting during the World Economic Forum in Davos after a clash with Israel's then-President Shimon Peres over Israeli air strikes in Gaza.  The Turkish leader vowed to never go back to Davos - and he has not returned since. But just a year later tensions reached breaking point when a ship, the Mavi Marmara, sailed from Istanbul to Gaza leading a flotilla of boats carrying volunteers and humanitarian aid to challenge Israel's maritime blockade of the Gaza Strip. When the Mavi Marmara refused to halt, Israeli commandos raided it in international waters and 10 Turkish citizens on board were killed in ensuing clashes. The incident led Turkey to suspend diplomatic relations with Israel for several years. According to Ms Sari Ertem, Turkey's pivot away from Israel and towards the Palestinians is due to the conservative and pro-Islamic grassroots of Mr Erdogan's AKP party. While Mr Erdogan's support for the Palestinians is sincere, she says it also aimed at calming down the conservative-nationalist political groups, which did not see sufficient reaction from the AKP in the first days of the war.  The head of the main opposition Republican People's Party in Turkey, Ozgur Ozel, called on the international community to act for Gaza, and the leader of the second biggest opposition party, Meral Aksener, has branded the Israeli prime minister a ""terrorist"". However, this support for Hamas has come at a cost for Turkey. Turkey's frayed relationship with Israel was restored only last year and then, within months of both countries reappointing their ambassadors, the war erupted. Turkey recalled its ambassador, and Israel's envoy returned out of security concerns. Giorgio Cafiero, CEO of Gulf State Analytics, a Washington DC-based geopolitical risk consultancy, says President Erdogan is unlikely to change path.  ""He has his domestic supporters and constituents, and he can't ignore such pressure coming from within Turkey and his base,"" Mr Cafiero argues. He also says the president cannot ignore his desire to be considered as a strong Muslim leader. ""Erdogan is a respected head of state throughout the wider Islamic world, and he has regional and international supporters, too."" Despite the rupture between the two countries, Ms Sarı Ertem believes it will not be too damaging. ""The anti-Israeli discourse, which becomes very much visible especially at times of serious civilian casualties caused by Israel on the Palestinian side, rarely disrupts the traditional Turkish foreign policy approach, which favours a balancing act,"" she says. ""It has always continued its relations with Israel at least economically, if not politically. Turkish-Israeli relations have proved to be quite resilient despite all the ups and downs during history."" Correction 4 January 2024: This article has been amended to make clear that the Mavi Mamara boat was leading a flotilla of boats carrying aid, rather than carrying aid itself. "
geopolitical tensions,Taiwan bear badge punches back after China drills,2024-09-15,2023-04-11,By Robert Plummer,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-65241432,"People in Taiwan alarmed at China's latest military drills have found a symbolic way of turning a geopolitical tussle into a bear-knuckle fight. A popular new badge depicts a Taiwanese black bear punching Winnie the Pooh, who often appears in memes representing Chinese leader Xi Jinping. The fad began among air force pilots, but has since gone viral. Taiwan is a self-ruled island with its own government and constitution, but China sees it as a breakaway province. On Monday, China finished three days of military drills around Taiwan, which included ""sealing off"" the island and simulating targeted strikes. Beijing began the exercises on Saturday after Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen met US House Speaker Kevin McCarthy in California. After the drills ended, Taiwan's defence ministry said it would not stop strengthening its combat preparedness. Images and videos released by the ministry to back up its stance included the sight of a pilot wearing a sew-on patch of the battling bears - and social media users were quick to highlight it. The badge, available in two versions, has the word ""Scramble!"" at the bottom, one of them also proclaiming ""We are open 24/7"". A third badge shows a Taiwanese fighter pilot slapping a panda, China's national symbol. Taiwanese people were quick to snap up the Pooh-punching patches, which retailed at 200 Taiwanese dollars (£5.30; $6.50). They were produced by Wings Fan Goods in Taoyuan city, east of the capital, Taipei, which has now sold out of them. Taiwan's air force told the Reuters news agency that it did not ""particularly encourage"" its members to wear the patch, which is not a part of their uniform. However, it added that it would ""maintain an open attitude"" to anything that raised morale."
geopolitical tensions,Suspected Chinese spy balloon tracked across US,2024-09-15,2023-02-02,By Max Matza,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-64507225,"The US is tracking a suspected Chinese surveillance balloon that has been spotted flying over sensitive sites in recent days. Defence officials said they were confident the ""high-altitude surveillance balloon"" belonged to China. It was most recently seen above the western state of Montana. The military decided against shooting it down in case debris falls. China warned against speculation and ""hype"" until the facts are verified. The object flew over Alaska's Aleutian Islands and through Canada before appearing over the city of Billings in Montana on Wednesday, US officials said. A senior defence official said the government prepared fighter jets, including F-22s, in case the White House ordered the object to be shot down. Canada said on Friday that it was monitoring ""a potential second incident"" involving a surveillance balloon, but did not say which country could be behind it. It said in the statement that it is working closely with the US to ""safeguard Canada's sensitive information from foreign intelligence threats"".   Top military leaders, including Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin and General Mark Milley, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, met on Wednesday to assess the threat. Mr Austin was travelling in the Philippines at the time. Montana, a sparsely populated state, is home to one of only three nuclear missile silo fields in the country, at Malmstrom Air Force Base, and the official said the apparent spy craft was flying over sensitive sites to collect information. But the military leaders advised against taking ""kinetic action"" against the balloon because of the danger that falling debris might pose to people on the ground.  Officials refrained from giving information about the exact size of the balloon, but described it as ""sizeable"", with reports of pilots being able to see it, even from a distance. US media have reported another US official comparing it to the size of three buses.  The defence department, however, said there was no ""significantly enhanced threat"" of US intelligence being compromised, because American officials ""know exactly where this balloon is and exactly where it's passing over"". And there was also no threat to civilian aviation as the balloon was ""significantly"" above the altitude used by commercial airlines.  The statement added that the balloon is unlikely to give much more information than China can already collect using satellites. The US had raised the matter with Chinese officials in their embassy in Washington DC and in Beijing, officials added. China's foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said Beijing is currently attempting to verify the reports of the surveillance balloon, adding that ""until the facts are clear, making conjectures and hyping up the issue will not help to properly resolve it"". ""China is a responsible country and always abides strictly by international law. We have no intention of violating the territory or airspace of any sovereign country,"" she said. During Thursday's briefing at the Pentagon, officials declined to disclose the aircraft's current location and did not give information on where it was launched from.  They added that such surveillance balloons had been tracked in the past several years, but this one was ""appearing to hang out for a longer period of time this time around"". It confused social media users in Montana, with some posting images of a pale round object high in the sky. Others reported seeing US military planes in the area, apparently monitoring the object. Billings office worker Chase Doak told the Associated Press news agency that he noticed the ""big white circle in the sky"" and went home to get a better camera.  ""I thought maybe it was a legitimate UFO,"" he said. ""So I wanted to make sure I documented it and took as many photos as I could."" Chinese state media site the Global Times accused the US of aggravating tensions between China and the US by frequently creating a Cold War atmosphere. It is also being widely discussed on Chinese social media, with many amused at the reported use of balloons for surveillance. ""We have so many satellites, why would we need to use a balloon,"" wrote one user on Weibo. Senator Marco Rubio, the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, slammed China's alleged balloon. ""The level of espionage aimed at our country by Beijing has grown dramatically more intense & brazen over the last 5 years,"" he tweeted. Montana Governor Greg Gianforte, a Republican, said in a statement that he had been briefed on the ""deeply troubling"" situation. Speaking at an unrelated event in Washington DC on Thursday, CIA Director William Burns made no mention of the balloon, but called China the ""biggest geopolitical challenge"" currently facing the US. The alleged spy craft is likely to increase tensions ahead of US Secretary of State Antony Blinken's visit to China next week. It will be the first visit to the country by a Biden administration cabinet secretary. The top US diplomat will be in Beijing to hold talks on a wide range of issues, including security, Taiwan and Covid-19. He will also meet Chinese President Xi Jinping, the the Financial Times reported on Thursday. Balloons are one of oldest forms of surveillance technology. Compared to other air surveillance devices, they can be operated cheaply without personnel, while remaining airborne for long periods of time. "
geopolitical tensions,South East Asia feels economic pinch of Ukraine war,2024-09-15,2022-03-22,By Monica Miller & Derek Cai,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-60733609,"Jia Ruiying moved to Singapore more than two years ago to set up a business. Then the Covid pandemic hit. Now - as the owner of the country's only Russian supermarket - she is facing a whole other set of challenges. Russian Supermart, which stocks a range of food and drink from across Eastern Europe, hasn't had a shipment since four days before Russia launched its attack on Ukraine on 24 February.  ""Our products from Ukrainian suppliers will likely stop,"" says Ms Jia. It comes at a time when many ex-pat Eastern Europeans are looking for a bit of comfort amid a harrowing situation at home.   ""When the war started, a lot of Ukrainians, Russians and Belarusians panicked and came to my store, afraid of not being able to get the food they want for their families here, "" she says. ""So they bought a lot of these items from the store and stocked up at home."" As a result of the conflict, she is now planning to diversify her supply chain ""to more places in Eastern Europe to avoid any delays in product shipments due to the Russian-Ukraine war"". On top of this, the decision by Western allies to cut some Russian banks out of the Swift international payment system is making it hard for both her and her customers to pay their bills. ""Some of customers are having difficulties withdrawing money from their banks due to sanctions,"" Ms Jia says. ""After the western sanctions on Swift transactions in Russia we've been having some difficulties with transactions."" Like other business operators in South East Asia, Ms Jia had been hoping for a chance to recover from the economic fall-out from Covid.  Prior to the pandemic, businesses had been expanding in the region. Companies such as sportswear brands Nike, Adidas and Puma had been shifting production from China to South East Asia to help cut down on manufacturing costs.  Geopolitical tensions between the US and China also spurred the shift and in 2019 foreign direct investment in South East Asia reached a record $182bn according to the Association of South East Asian Nations.  ""A rising number of companies were moving their manufacturing operations to lower-cost locations, with India, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam among the most popular jurisdictions,"" according to accountancy firm KPMG. South East Asia gets most of its crude from the Middle East and parts of Africa and is therefore, perhaps, less vulnerable than other nations directly impacted by sanctions on Russian oil.  But a spike in oil prices has led to a sharp rise in petrol prices  ""It doesn't matter whether Russia is imposing an export embargo on you or not,"" says Vandana Hari, global energy expert and founder of Vanda Insights. ""At the end of the day, whatever crude you're buying from the international market, you are paying 10 year-high rates for that crude.  All countries are being affected."" Pain at the pump is being felt by real estate agent Justin Quek. He drives as much as 80 km (50 miles) each day shuttling his clients around Singapore.  ""The car essentially is like a mobile office for me,"" he says. Mr Quek is now paying an extra S$30.00 (£17) each time he fills up his car every four to five days and fuel costs eat up between 20-25% of his monthly budget. As a result, he's considering more fuel efficient options such as an electric vehicle though that is a pricey choice. ""In Singapore now, it doesn't quite make economic sense yet, because there's still quite a big premium on electric vehicles,"" he said. And that may be likely to last as prices for nickel, a Russian export that is used to make electric vehicle batteries, remain volatile.  For now, the high cost of petrol is part of doing business. Mr Quek says he looks the other way when the numbers tick upward at the pump: ""You just have to suck it up. It's the cost of doing business. Except now, one has to work a lot harder.""     But it is a delicate moment for southeast Asian countries and their citizens, says Ms Hari.  ""The vast majority of the countries here are emerging economies. Lower middle income and lower income families make up for the vast proportion of the population.  ""These are the people who get disproportionately affected by rising costs."""
geopolitical tensions,FTSE 100 dips as N Korea fears persist,2024-09-15,2017-09-04,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-41146396,"The FTSE 100 started the week with a stumble amid fears over unrest in Asia, following North Korea's test of a nuclear bomb at the weekend. The index ended Monday's trading down 27.03 points or 0.36% at 7,411.47. Mining stocks were some of the biggest risers, with Fresnillo up 2.9% and Randgold Resources gaining 2%. Analysts said the rise was driven by a rush to safe-haven stocks in the wake of the geopolitical tensions, with the price of precious metals up sharply. The underlying gold price is at its highest level in almost a year.  Traditionally precious metals such as gold and silver are seen as safe investments when there is financial or political turmoil.  Nonetheless, Connor Campbell, financial analyst at spread betting firm Spreadex, noted the FTSE had managed to stay above the 7,400 level it had reached again last week.  ""North Korea's latest nuclear naughtiness has sent another ripple of fear through the markets this Monday - as has the US threat of a 'massive military response' and South Korea's own show of (simulated) force,"" he said. ""However, with the increasing regularity of such tests, and the USA's Labor Day holiday, the edge has been taken off the European losses.""  On the currency markets, the pound was flat against the dollar at $1.2952 and also 0.42% lower against the euro at 1.0875 euros."
geopolitical tensions,South China Sea tops Asean agenda,2024-09-15,2012-07-09,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-18765094,"Asean foreign ministers will be joined by regional counterparts and US Secretary of State Clinton Tension in the South China Sea is expected to top the agenda for Asean's regional forum this week. China and several countries in the 10-nation bloc are laying claim to disputed waters in the area. Foreign ministers of the group are meeting in Cambodia before the arrival of their regional counterparts from 16 countries, including China. US Secretary of State Hilary Clinton will also join the meeting in Phnom Penh later in the week. ""The fact that the world is more interested and attentive and taking the issue more seriously is precisely because this region of the world has become more important to the world,"" Surin Pitsuwan, Asean secretary general, told the BBC.    ""They don't want it to be derailed - they don't want conflict that would affect the growth trajectory of this region of the world."" Mrs Clinton, who will be leading a trade delegation, has called for ''progress'' on a code of conduct for the South China Sea, signalling the United States' interest in the geopolitical tension in the region. Speaking to reporters in Tokyo on Sunday, she urged China and Asean nations ""to resolve their disputes without coercion, without intimidation, without threats and without conflict"". China's Foreign Ministry said on Monday that it was willing to discuss the code of conduct. ""When conditions are ripe China would like to discuss with Asean countries the formulation of the COC [code of conduct],"" spokesman Liu Weimin said. ""But I want to stress that the COC is not aimed at resolving disputes, but aimed at building mutual trust and deepening cooperation."" The Philippines has been leading the charge for Asean to pressure China to accept the code of conduct. A maritime stand-off between China and the Philippines developed in a reef area known as the Scaborough Shoal in April, with China denying reports it was preparing for war at the height of the tension in May. Both sides accused the other of intruding into territorial waters. Vietnam was also angered by a recent call from China for oil exploration bids in disputed territory.  China has overlapping territorial claims with several Asean members - the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei - in the resource rich area. But Asean's members are divided over what to do. The four affected countries want action but others, like Cambodia, are grateful recipients of Chinese aid and investment, and reluctant to rock the boat, says the BBC's Guy DeLauney.  Asean was set up in 1967 by founder members Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Singapore.  Brunei joined in 1984, followed by Vietnam in 1995, Laos and Burma in 1997 and Cambodia in 1999.  What is the South China Sea dispute? Tensions rise in South China Sea dispute.

geopolitical tensions,How to negotiate with world's most secretive country,2024-09-15,2023-07-25,By Chelsea Bailey,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66296792,"A country with closed borders and few diplomatic channels... talking to North Korea is tricky at the best of times. The stakes were even higher when a young American soldier was in their hands. How could the US have gone about his release? Private Travis King was released to US custody on Wednesday after being held for more than two months by North Korea. He crossed illegally into the country on 18 July. Since then, his condition and the details of his confinement in North Korea have been unclear.  The incident posed a key challenge for the US, as it never had an official diplomatic relationship with North Korea. As a result, the US relies on a network of backchannels to negotiate the return of citizens detained in the country. Sweden was involved with the Pvt King case, a spokesman for the Swedish embassy in the US has confirmed. It is believed the 23-year-old soldier was detained and questioned by North Korean authorities.   Pvt King was last seen running across the demilitarised zone separating North and South Korea. Tensions then escalated in the region, with North Korea firing two ballistic missiles into the sea on 26 July after a US nuclear-powered submarine was stationed in the South.  ""All sides are trying to understand what happened and what to do,"" said Mickey Bergman, executive director of the Richardson Center for Global Diplomacy. Mr Bergman, who has spent nearly 20 years negotiating to return US citizens from hostile nations, said the best chance at releasing a prisoner is right after they are detained. This is when they are likely being interrogated by the country's officials but before they have been charged with a crime, like spying. It was in that time before things became official that negotiators could best appeal to people's humanity, Mr Bergman said. ""I think there's a misconception about what negotiations are,"" he said.  ""If we pound our chests, and flip tables, and demand that the evil North Koreans return our soldier, we are likely going to cause them to dig in."" Here is how the US has previously negotiated for an American citizen's return.  Because the United States has never officially held diplomatic ties with North Korea, during a detainee crisis, Sweden has served as an intermediary from their embassy in Pyongyang and has helped to relay communications to North Korean officials.   But there are also backchannels. North Korea maintains a mission at the United Nations in New York. In times of crisis, the mission - dubbed the New York Channel - has become an avenue for officials for both countries to hold talks.   For years, Robert King was one of the first people who received a call when an American was captured by North Korea. As the former special envoy for North Korean human rights at the US state department, the ambassador has helped negotiate for the release of multiple detainees including student Otto Warmbier and American missionary Kenneth Bae.    After 17 months in captivity, US college student Otto Warmbier was released from North Korean detention in 2017 in a comatose state. He returned to the United States with extensive brain damage and died days after reuniting with his family.  Otto Warmbier's death sparked international outrage and his family has levelled allegations of abuse and torture against the North Koreans. After a brief period of diplomacy under the Trump administration, Mr King said renewed political tensions between the two countries often colour negotiations, making detainees a pawn in wider geopolitical fights. ""[The North Koreans] see this as, 'how do we use this opportunity to make the US look bad?' And whatever happens it's not going to be a happy outcome,"" Mr King said.  For nearly 20 years, Mr Bergman has worked alongside former New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson to secure the release of prisoners from countries hostile to the United States.   Although the Richardson Center is not involved in the Travis King case, Mr Bergman said in his experience, when it came to North Korea, there was no playbook for negotiations.  Instead, he said, it is best to approach tense negotiations through what he calls ""fringe diplomacy"".  US non-profit-making organisations and humanitarian agencies have provided aid to North Koreans for decades. When official channels stall, these non-governmental backchannels are often called upon to negotiate on behalf of a detainee's family.  An NGO's separation from the US government is a benefit, Mr Bergman said, because it allows negotiations to focus solely on the wellbeing and return of the detainee, instead of global politics. ""People can talk to us about policy issues but there's nothing we can do about that,"" he said. ""We are much more able to insulate the issue and come up with pathways to resolve some of these situations.""  Mr Bergman said the world often focuses on the moment of ""intervention,"" when a political prisoner is rescued and returned home. But that moment, he said, is not possible without years of meaningful engagement.  ""You have to build relationships so that when there is a crisis, you're not starting from scratch.""  But the Covid pandemic has made both of these avenues of negotiation more challenging.  North Korea completely closed its borders during the pandemic and Mr Bergman said it is unclear if the Swedish Embassy in Pyongyang has returned to full capacity.  Complicating matters further, after a brief period of attempted diplomacy, the Trump administration imposed a travel ban to North Korea, rendering US passports and visas invalid.  The ban has remained in place under the Biden administration and has effectively ended humanitarian avenues for engagement, Mr Bergman said.  ""North Korea is the only country in the world where there's a travel ban, that it's illegal for Americans to travel,"" he said. ""The North Koreans see that as an insult."" Mr Bergman, who was involved in the negotiations for Warmbier's release, said he believes the international blowback over Otto Warmbier's death has shifted the North Korean perspective on political detainees, and the country may be more amenable to compromise. ""After dealing with the Otto Warmbier negotiations, and the very tragic outcome, I believe that the North Koreans have chosen not play in the game of political prisoners anymore,"" he said.  Now that Pvt King has been released, what happens next remains to be seen. "
geopolitical tensions,Why businesses are pulling billions from China,2024-09-15,2023-11-14,By Annabelle Liang,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-67353177,"Foreign businesses have been pulling money out of China at a faster rate than they have been putting it in, official data shows.  The country's slowing economy, low interest rates and a geopolitical tussle with the US have sparked doubt about its economic potential.  All eyes will be on a crucial meeting between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and US President Joe Biden this week.  But businesses appear to be already erring on the side of caution. ""Anxieties around geopolitical risk, domestic policy uncertainty and slower growth are pushing companies to think about alternative markets,"" says Nick Marro from the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU).   China recorded a deficit of $11.8bn (£9.6bn) in foreign investment in the three months to the end of September - the first time since records began in 1998.  This suggests that foreign companies are not reinvesting their profits in China, rather they are moving the money out of the country.  ""China is currently facing slower growth and needs to make some corrections,"" says a spokesperson for the Swiss industrial machinery manufacturer Oerlikon, which pulled 250m francs ($277m; £227m) from China last year. ""In 2022, we were one of the first companies to transparently communicate that we expect the economic slowdown in China to impact our business,"" the spokesperson adds. ""Consequently, we began early to implement actions and measures to mitigate these effects."" China remains a key market for the firm. It has close to 2,000 employees across the country, which accounts for more than a third of its sales. Oerlikon noted that the Chinese economy was still expected to post growth of around 5% in the next few years, ""which is among the highest in the world."" Since the onset of the pandemic, businesses like Oerlikon have contended with the challenges of operating in what is the world's biggest market. China had implemented one of the world's strictest pandemic lockdowns through its ""zero-Covid"" policy. This caused disruptions to the supply chains of many companies, such as technology giant Apple, which makes most of its iPhones in China. The firm has since diversified its supply chain by  moving some production to India. Mr Marro believes more companies have heeded calls for diversification this year, as tensions between China and the US rose with fresh export restrictions on raw materials and technology needed to make advanced chips. ""We aren't seeing many companies pulling out of China. Many of the big multinational firms have been in the market for decades, and they're not willing to give up market share that they've spent 20, 30 or 40 years cultivating. But in terms of new investment, in particular, we are seeing a reassessment."" Businesses are also considering the impact of interest rates. China bucked the trend as many countries around the world raised rates sharply last year. Many major central banks, including the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, have been hiking interest rates to tackle inflation. The higher cost of borrowing, which promises higher returns, also attracts foreign capital.  Meanwhile policymakers in China have cut the cost of borrowing to support its economy and struggling property industry. The yuan has depreciated by more than 5% against the dollar and euro this year. Rather than reinvesting China earnings back in the country, business are spending the money, the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China says.  It adds: ""Those with excess cash and earnings in China have been increasingly transferring these funds overseas, where they will earn a higher investment return compared to investments in China."" Some firms had withdrawn earnings from China as ""part of their long-term cycles"" of taking profits ""once their projects reach a specific scale and profitability"", Michael Hart, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, observed.  ""The withdrawal of profits does not necessarily indicate that companies are unhappy with China, but rather that their investments here have matured."" Mr Hart says it's ""encouraging because it means companies are able to integrate their China operations into their global operations."" Canada-based aerospace electronics company Firan Technology Group invested up to C$10m ($7.2m; £5.9m) in China over the last decade, and withdrew C$2.2m from the country last year and in the first quarter of 2023. ""We are not exiting China at all. We are investing and growing our business there and taking out any excess cash to invest elsewhere in the world,"" says the firm's president and chief executive Brad Bourne. ""We had surplus cash in China and bringing it back to help fund our recent US acquisitions was just prudent cash management, and it meant that our borrowing was reduced,"" he adds. Analysts say there is much uncertainty about what lies ahead - both in terms of interest rates and China-US ties. China's central bank could move to lower interest rates further this year to support its economy, says Dan Wang, the chief economist of Hang Seng Bank China. Lowering interest rates could put more pressure on the already weakened yuan. ""There is very limited room for monetary easing right now because of the pressure of currency depreciation,"" she says. ""If economic sentiment improves next month, it's safe to say that China will lower interest rates. But if sentiment doesn't improve, the central bank will have a very difficult decision to make."" Businesses are cautiously optimistic about the upcoming meeting between Presidents Xi and Biden, says the EIU's Mr Marro. ""Direct meetings between the two presidents tend to exert a stabilising force on bilateral ties. We have also seen a flurry of US-China diplomatic engagement over the past couple of months, which has contributed to this feeling that both sides are aiming to put a floor under the relationship,"" he says.  ""That said, it doesn't take much for things to fall apart again. Until companies and investors feel like they can navigate with more certainty, this drag on foreign investment into China will continue."""
geopolitical tensions,Suppressing China won't make US great - Beijing,2024-09-15,2023-03-07,By Kelly Ng,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-64871808,"China's foreign minister says China-US relations have ""seriously deviated"" while warning of potential conflict. ""Containment and suppression will not make America great. It will not stop the rejuvenation of China,"" said Qin Gang.  Mr Qin, China's former ambassador to the US, held his first press conference as foreign minister on Tuesday. The spy balloon saga has heightened tensions between the superpowers despite recent efforts to improve ties.  ""It [the US] regards China as its primary rival and the most consequential geopolitical challenge. This is like the first button in the shirt being put wrong,"" said Mr Qin, speaking on the sidelines of the annual meeting of China's parliament in Beijing.  The foreign minister was responding to a question on whether a healthy China-US relationship was still possible as differences between the countries grew. The US called for establishing ""guardrails"", but what it really wants is for China to not hit back with words or actions when provoked, Mr Qin added.  He was referring to US President Joe Biden's comments last month that the US would ""compete fully with China but [is] not looking for conflict"".  Mr Qin said: ""If the US does not put on the brakes and continues to roar down the wrong road, no amount of guardrails can stop the derailment and overturning, and it is bound to fall into conflict and confrontation. Who will bear its disastrous consequences?""  He also said the diplomatic crisis caused by the balloon incident could have been averted but the US acted with ""the presumption of guilt"".  Washington has previously described the suspected spy balloon as a ""clear violation of US sovereignty"". Beijing admitted the object belonged to them, but said it was a civilian airship blown off-course.  Spy Balloons: Are They Really A Threat? The BBC's Gordon Corera breaks down what we know about spy balloons Watch now on BBC iPlayer (UK only) Relations between the two countries deteriorated during former US President Donald Trump's administration, which launched a trade war against China in 2018. The two superpowers continue to clash on various issues, including Taiwan, China's militarisation of the South China Sea and the origins of Covid. Mr Qin's comments follow Chinese President Xi Jinping's unusually direct rebuke of the US on Monday. Mr Xi said ""Western countries led by the US had implemented all-round containment, encirclement and suppression"" against China and that this brought ""severe challenges"" to the country. On Tuesday, Mr Qin said an ""invisible hand"" was driving the Ukraine crisis but did not name any country or individual. He reiterated that China had not provided weapons to either side of the Russia-Ukraine war and called for peace talks to resume. However, he asked: ""Why should the US demand that China refrain from supplying arms to Russia when it sells arms to Taiwan?"" The Ukraine crisis has reached a ""critical juncture"", he said. ""Either a ceasefire will stop the war, restore peace and embark on a political settlement, or fuel the fire, expand the crisis and drag it into the abyss of losing control."" Mr Qin, 56, was named China's foreign minister in December 2022 and is one of the youngest appointees to this post in the country's history. He replaced Wang Yi, who was promoted to the politburo of the ruling Communist Party in October that year. A trusted aide of Chinese President Xi Jinping, Mr Qin is well known as a tough-talking diplomat. "
geopolitical tensions,US holds interest rates steady at 22-year high,2024-09-15,2023-11-01,By Faarea Masud,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-67290817,"The US central bank has held its key interest rate at its current 22-year high as it seeks to stabilise price rises, which had recently reached near-record levels. The Federal Reserve's rate target remains at 5.25%-5.5%. The bank has been raising borrowing costs with the hope of cooling the economy and slowing inflation, the rate at which prices rise. It comes after recent data showed the US economy grew faster than expected. Raising interest rates is one mechanism that central banks can use to tackle inflation. The theory is that by raising interest rates and making it more expensive to borrow, consumers will spend less and that would lead to slower price rises. The bank had faced criticism, with some suggesting that holding interest rates at higher levels could put the US economy at risk of entering a recession. But the economy grew by a better-than-expected 4.9% from July to September. The figure was a big jump from the previous three months and was buoyed by a tight jobs market and increased consumer spending. In a statement on Wednesday, the Federal Reserve said that the vote in favour of holding rates was unanimous, adding that it was prepared to adjust its policy ""as appropriate"" if risks emerge. It said that holding the rate would give the bank time to ""assess additional information"" on how the economy is performing. Its chair Jerome Powell said a few months of good data on the economy are ""only the beginning of building confidence"" that inflation was moving towards its target.  He said that there was still a ""long way to go"", and said that he understood that high inflation causes ""hardship"" as it erodes spending power for consumers.  He said that he understood the Fed's previous run of rate rises was affecting communities and businesses, but that the rate of price rises still remain well above its target. It signals that the central bank may delay lowering interest rates, as inflation currently stands at 3.7% in the US, which is still above the Fed's target of 2%. Independent US economic analyst Peter Jankovskis told the BBC that the rate hold was ""no great surprise"" with ""no immediate impact on stocks"".  He added that ""elevated long-term bond yields"" also contributed to the Fed's decision. The yield on long-term government bonds is a key indicator of how investors perceive the strength of the US economy. Chairman Powell also said that there were ""significant issues"" the central bank had to take into account.  ""Global geopolitical tensions are elevated, including Ukraine"", he said, adding that the Fed was watching the Israel-Gaza situation for its ""economic implications"" and ""proceeding carefully"" given the risks faced globally. But Mr Jankovskis said: ""It appears that the Fed sees the economy as strong and is focused on whether additional rate increases might be needed. Higher for longer remains the theme."" In many economies, higher borrowing costs have led to more expensive loans for businesses, homes and other goods and services, with the end of an era of low-cost borrowing. Similarly in the UK, households have seen their budgets squeezed by higher mortgage payments or borrowing costs. The Bank of England is widely expected to hold its current interest rate when it announces its next decision on Thursday.  The rate was left unchanged in September, ending a run of 14 consecutive rises."
geopolitical tensions,Why are Autumn Statement tax cuts looking more likely?,2024-09-15,2023-11-21,By Faisal Islam,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-67473404,"It looks like the Autumn Statement will now include at least one crowd-pleasing personal tax cut - so why the change of message and which tax could be cut? When I spoke to Jeremy Hunt 10 days ago, just after it was confirmed that the UK economy was not growing, I suggested to him that personal tax cuts might help. He said there were ""no shortcuts"" and clearly signalled that his focus was on growth-enhancing business tax cuts. He'd previously declared personal tax cuts ""virtually impossible"". A week on, I spoke to the chancellor again, at a hydrogen energy facility in Sheffield. The caution on such cuts had gone. And the prime minster has now suggested the time has come to cut tax. For Rishi Sunak, last Wednesday's drop in inflation was a clear turning point in Britain's recent economic story. During his time as chancellor and as prime minister - most of the past four years - the UK and most of the world have been hit by an unprecedented series of geopolitical crises that have led to big spending and rolling inflationary shocks. The pandemic led to an inflationary supply chain crisis pushing prices up, and then the Russia-Ukraine conflict saw the double whammy of the world's biggest energy exporter invading one of the world's biggest food exporters. At this precise time, the size of Britain's workforce was hit. In part, this was due to the aftermath of the pandemic, and in some key sectors, by more restrictive post-Brexit worker visas. It was a potent cocktail for inflation. The government's argument therefore, is that last week's confirmation that inflation has more than halved since its peak is a turning point for inflation. The UK is on a glidepath to normal inflation levels, and therefore, they argue, there is little risk of a personal tax cut adding to price pressures. But the PM's argument goes further. He says that the 4.6% inflation figure also represents a turning point of a rolling series of economic crises since 2020. The time to put four years of higher public spending, borrowing, and taxation behind us. He is taking aim at Labour's calls for a ""new"" post-pandemic world of more resilient local supply chains, and more borrowing-funded public spending especially on green infrastructure. US President Joe Biden may be able to do this because the US has the privilege of printing the world's reserve currency, and is insulated from fears about its debts. The UK, especially after last year's mini budget, cannot do this, Mr Sunak argued. This will be the dividing line of the next year with a Labour Party that aims to spend £28bn a year more on public investment by the end of the coming Parliament. So the tax cuts will be part of a general message that, having seen inflation halve, now the focus is on growth. The overwhelming focus of the cuts will be aimed at helping businesses to invest. But, a tax cut that helps ""make work pay"" and so improves the supply of workers, helping relieve a key constraint on growth, will also be delivered. National Insurance seems to fit the bill, because it directly helps employers or workers keep more from wage packets. Another option is ironing out some of the inconsistencies in the tax system that see some universal credit recipients, working parents and higher earners facing effective tax rates so high that it makes little sense to work more hours. Former pensions minister Steve Webb has also spotted his old department seeming to prepare an unusual announcement on benefit uprating on an obscure part of the Department for Work and Pensions website. When setting how much benefits go up next April, the government could decide to use October's lower inflation figure instead of the usual September figure. That could squeeze between £2bn and £3bn from the welfare bill every year. Both the PM and chancellor make the argument that the level of benefits may exacerbate worker shortage problems. In Westminster, others point out that the loss of the Supreme Court case on a plan to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda, on the same day as the inflation figure, may also help explain the search for a headline personal tax cut to assuage his backbenchers. The speech the PM gave on Monday, when he said the government was now able to cut taxes, was due to be given last Wednesday, before the Supreme Court's ruling. So the contours of the argument this week will be the government arguing that an economic turnaround has created space for a tax cut, and the opposition will instead say the PM is jumping the gun at the behest of backbenchers and in any case only reversing one of two dozen tax rises. In making a turnaround argument, it is worth waiting for what the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) says in its forecasts for the economy. This month's Bank of England forecasts for quarterly growth next year are 0.01%, -0.04%, 0.01% and 0.02%. Over 2024, it adds up to zero. The economy did avoid the recession predicted for this year, but how seriously can Downing Street proclaim a turnaround if the OBR predicts little or no growth over the next year? It is also worth watching on what basis the government claims the PM's target on growth will be met. So underneath a big call made on tax cuts at the Autumn Statement, there is a much wider, immediate political argument, and the outline of choice for the general election. But watch out for whether the OBR supports this ""turnaround"" picture. What help would you like from the Autumn Statement? Do you have any questions you want answering?

geopolitical tensions,JFK's mother on the loss of her son,2024-09-15,2023-11-22,Myles Burke,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20231121-jfk-assassination-john-f-kennedys-mother-roses-agony-and-ecstasy-on-the-tragic-loss-of-her-son-60-years-ago,"To mark the 60th anniversary of JFK's death, revisit an exclusive BBC interview with the US president's mother, Rose, who movingly details the family's intense pride and sorrow. ""I'm an optimist. When I first heard it, I thought maybe it was just an accident, or a slight… slight sort of thing,"" says Rose Kennedy, grief still etched on her face as she reflects on hearing the news that her son John F Kennedy had been shot in Dallas in 1963. ""But then Bobby [Kennedy, JFK's younger brother] telephoned and said it was serious, and then events moved very quickly."" More like this: - JFK's death: One of the US's biggest mysteries - The 'alien invasion' that fooled the US - How Mickey Mouse saved Disney from ruin In this exclusive BBC clip from 1973, recorded to mark the 10th anniversary of her son's death, Rose speaks with poise and restraint. It was not the first horrific tragedy she had faced: her eldest son, Joe Jr, had been killed in action during World War Two; her daughter, Kathleen, in a plane crash in 1948. And just five years after JFK's fatal shooting, she was bereaved again, when her son, Democratic presidential candidate Robert died at the hands of an assassin. In this moving clip, she describes the pride she felt as Kennedy's mother at his inauguration, coupled with her intense grief upon his death, as: ""the agony and the ecstasy of Michelangelo: we've had these ecstatic moments – and these tragic ones"". The profound loss Rose felt at her son John's death would be reflected by the shock and grief that would play out across the US, to the extent that a whole generation would be able to remember exactly where they were when they heard that he had been shot. In the frantic police investigation following the shooting, Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested as the prime suspect, but before he could stand trial, he was shot and killed by nightclub owner Jack Ruby, leaving many unanswered questions. The circumstances of JFK's death have captivated the public's imagination, and new details about the assassination continue to come to light. In December 2022, US President Joe Biden ordered the release of thousands of unedited government files about the murder, and this year a book by a former Secret Service agent – who witnessed the president's death at close range – cast doubt on the conclusion by the Warren Commission, the 1964 US government inquiry into the killing, that Lee Harvey Oswald had been the sole gunman. Presidential hopes Born in 1917, JFK was raised in a wealthy, politically-connected family of Irish Catholics in Boston. He was one of nine close-knit, boisterous children, and his father, Joe, fostered an atmosphere of intellectual and physical competition among his offspring. The second oldest son, John was pushed to excel from an early age. After studying at Harvard, and writing a best-selling book while he was there, he volunteered his services to the US Armed Forces, and saw combat in the South Pacific during World War Two, winning a medal for heroism for leading his comrades to safety after their boat was sunk. In History In History is a series which uses the BBC's unique audio and video archive to explore historical events that still resonate today JFK initially hoped to pursue a career in journalism or teaching. His father had groomed his older brother, Joe Jr, to run for political office but he was killed in combat in 1944. So, when JFK was discharged from the Navy the following year, he took up his father's presidential hopes. Energetic and eloquent, he proved adept at the task, first getting elected to the US House of Representatives in 1946, followed by a successful bid for the US Senate six years later. In 1960, he set his sights on the White House. Standing as the Democratic candidate, he faced off against Republican Richard Nixon in an unprecedented series of TV debates that proved to be the highlight of the campaign. Telegenic and clearly at ease in front of the camera, he seemed a forward-thinking politician who resonated with the youthful idealism that was growing in the aftermath of World War Two. He narrowly won the election, becoming the youngest US president in history at the age of 43, as well as the first Roman Catholic. In his inaugural address, he laid out a bold vision for collective action and civic duty with his famous words: ""Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country."" This set the tone for his presidency with a stated commitment to civil rights, scientific advancement and international diplomacy. He established the Peace Corps, enabling young Americans to volunteer to work in developing nations, and he set an ambitious goal to put a man on the Moon by the end of the 1960s. He also advocated strongly for African Americans' equal rights, sending federal troops to enforce desegregation at the University of Mississippi. But his presidency was also framed by the intense geopolitical tension between the US and the Soviet Bloc when he came to power, much of which would play out over the island of Cuba. First when in 1961, he approved an easily defeated CIA plan to land Cuban exiles at the Bay of Pigs to overthrow the communist government. And then with the Cuban Missile Crisis, where the discovery of Soviet forces building silos for missiles on the island, triggered a tense standoff that brought the world to the brink of nuclear war. JFK as a president chimed with a generation who believed the future could be better, and were eager to actively participate in shaping it. He invited cameras into his life and that of his young family in a way that made people feel they knew him. His presidency seemed to hold immense promise and potential. When his life was cut short so shockingly, it sparked a wave of grief and mourning that left an indelible mark on the consciousness of the nation.

geopolitical tensions,Why did Armenia and Azerbaijan go to war?,2024-09-15,2020-09-28,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-54324772,"A peace deal has been agreed between Armenia and Azerbaijan, two former Soviet Union republics in the Caucasus region. It brings to an end six weeks of fierce fighting in which thousands of people were reported killed and many more displaced. At the heart of the conflict was the Nagorno-Karabakh region. It is recognised as part of Azerbaijan, but it is controlled by ethnic Armenians. The two countries fought a bloody war over the region in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and it has been the trigger for further violence in the years since. Nagorno-Karabakh is part of Azerbaijan, but its population is majority Armenian. As the Soviet Union saw increasing tensions in its constituent republics in the 1980s, Nagorno-Karabakh voted to become part of Armenia - sparking a war that stopped with a ceasefire in 1994.  Since then, Nagorno-Karabakh has remained part of Azerbaijan but is controlled by separatist ethnic Armenians backed by the Armenian government. Until recently, negotiations mediated by international powers had failed to deliver a peace agreement. Armenia is majority Christian while Azerbaijan is majority Muslim. Turkey has close ties to Azerbaijan, while Russia is allied with Armenia - although it also has good relations with Azerbaijan. The Caucasus is a strategically important mountainous region in south-east Europe. For centuries, different powers in the region - both Christian and Muslim - have vied for control there.  Modern-day Armenia and Azerbaijan became part of the Soviet Union when it formed in the 1920s. Nagorno-Karabakh was an ethnic-majority Armenian region, but the Soviets gave control over the area to Azerbaijani authorities. It was only as the Soviet Union began to collapse in the late 1980s that Nagorno-Karabakh's regional parliament officially voted to become part of Armenia. Azerbaijan sought to suppress the separatist movement, while Armenia backed it. This led to ethnic clashes, and - after Armenia and Azerbaijan declared independence from Moscow - a full-scale war.  Tens of thousands died and up to a million were displaced amid reports of ethnic cleansing and massacres committed by both sides. Most of those displaced in the war were Azerbaijanis. Armenian forces gained control of Nagorno-Karabakh and areas adjacent to it before a Russian-brokered ceasefire was declared in 1994. After that deal, Nagorno-Karabakh remained part of Azerbaijan, but since then has mostly been governed by a separatist, self-declared republic, run by ethnic Armenians and backed by the Armenian government. It also established the Nagorno-Karabakh Line of Contact, separating Armenian and Azerbaijan forces. Peace talks have taken place since then, mediated by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) Minsk Group - a body set up in 1992 and chaired by France, Russia and the United States.  But clashes continued, and a serious flare-up in 2016 saw the deaths of dozens of troops on both sides. The conflict is further complicated by geopolitics. Nato member-state Turkey was the first nation to recognise Azerbaijan's independence in 1991. Former Azeri President Heydar Aliyev once described the two as ""one nation with two states"". Both share a Turkic culture and populations. Moreover, Turkey has no official relations with Armenia. In 1993 Turkey shut its border with Armenia in support of Azerbaijan during the war over Nagorno-Karabakh. Armenia meanwhile has had good relations with Russia. There is a Russian military base in Armenia, and both are members of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) military alliance. However, President Vladimir Putin also has maintained good relations with Azerbaijan. In 2018, Armenia underwent a peaceful revolution, sweeping long-time ruler Serzh Sargsyan from power. Protest leader Nikol Pashinyan became the prime minister after free elections that year. Mr Pashinyan agreed with Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev to de-escalate tensions and set up the first military hotline between the two countries.  But in August 2019 Mr Pashinyan told crowds of ethnic Armenians assembled in the main city in Karabakh, Stepanakert, that ""Artsakh is Armenia, full stop."" Artsakh is the Armenian name for Karabakh. The remarks angered Azerbaijan and were repeatedly condemned by President Aliyev. Fighting broke out in July this year on the international border between Armenia and Azerbaijan, some 300km (185 miles) away from Nagorno-Karabakh. By the end of the month Turkey's military was taking part in large-scale joint exercises in Azerbaijan. The latest conflict broke out on 27 September. Armenia said Azerbaijan fired the first shots. Azerbaijan said it was launching a ""counter-offensive"" in response to Armenian aggression.  Fighting came to an end in November when both sides agreed to sign a Russian-brokered peace deal. Under its terms, Azerbaijan holds on to several areas that it gained control of during the conflict and Armenia will withdraw troops from them. Almost 2,000 Russian peacekeepers will monitor the truce."
geopolitical tensions,Governments make big bets on the computer chip industry,2024-09-15,2024-01-12,By Hannah Mullane,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-67576918,"I'm at the UK's newest computer chip plant in Durham. Formerly a ceramic pipe factory, from the outside it looks like a  big warehouse.  But inside the vast space is being transformed into a sophisticated hub for the manufacturing of computer chips. Pragmatic Semiconductor has already built one production line, which the industry likes to call fabrication lines, or fab lines. Sealed off in its own large room, the production line has all the expensive machinery needed to make the computer chips, and the air inside is carefully controlled to avoid any contamination during production. Pragmatic has the money to build another such production line, and funding of £182m ($230m) announced late last year will fund production lines three and four. As well as from private investors, Pragmatic secured funding from the government-backed UK Infrastructure Bank and British Patient Capital, a subsidiary of British Business Bank. But the Cambridge-based company will need much more money to complete its plan to build eight production lines in the old pipe factory.  From phones and computers, to cars and washing machines, almost every product with an on-off switch relies on the production of computer chips, also known as semiconductors. It is an industry that has seen a lot of turbulence over the last few years. There's been disruption to supply chains during the pandemic, and geopolitical tensions in Asia, where 90% of the world's most advanced chips originate.  David Moore, chief executive of Pragmatic Semiconductor, which is the largest semiconductor manufacturer in the UK, says the industry is going to need multiple types of semiconductors to solve ""different kinds of problems"" in the chip sector. Most semiconductors are made using silicon, but his company is taking a different approach.  They are making flexible chips - they actually bend - at their plant in Durham, which can be used in wearable technology, clothing authentication, and even in parcel labels to track and trace items. Rather than sitting on silicon wafer, Pragmatic's chips are built on a flexible thin film.  This approach results in chips that are cheaper and faster to manufacture than the standard silicon chip.  ""If you take a standard silicon manufacturing facility, it's going to take multiple years and billions of dollars to make,"" Mr Moore said. ""Our fabrication plant can be 10 to 100 times cheaper depending on what you compare it with.  ""In silicon, it will take three to six months to go from the start of the process all the way to a finished wafer product. For us, we can do that in less than 48 hours."" But it is no panacea. The flexible chip may be cheaper and quicker to make, but the advanced chips in phones, computers and other leading tech will still need the most advanced silicon-based computer chips. More technology of business A serious shortage of those chips in 2021, underlined how dependent global industry is on a few key suppliers.  In particular, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) makes 90% of the world's most advanced semiconductors.  In an effort to cut that dependency governments are spending huge sums to create stronger domestic chip industries. In August 2022, the US government signed into law the US Chips Act, which pledged $52bn (£41bn) to boost domestic production of computer chips. The European Union has its own project worth €43bn (£37bn). On a smaller scale the UK has promised £1bn of investment in the sector. Analysts says that the big chip manufacturers are responding to such government incentives. Germany has seen a huge wave of investment. A Taiwanese semiconductor manufacturer has decided, together with three European headquartered companies, to invest €10bn in Dresden. ""We see that 80% of of global production is currently in Asia, the reliance on Asian countries means we really need to strengthen our resilience here in the EU,"" notes Hendrik Abma, director general of the European Semiconductor Industry Association.  ""I think the realisation about the importance of semiconductors for industry here in Europe, for our technical development, has been underestimated in the past."" As well as Germany, Mr Abma notes that Belgium, Lithuania and the Czech Republic, have seen significant investments. Following the US Chips Act, almost 500 companies applied to the US government for funding for projects, according to Hannah Dohmen, research analyst at Georgetown's Centre for Security and Emerging Technology in Washington. Plants are planned in New York, Arizona, Texas, Ohio and Idaho, she says.  And outside the US and Europe, other projects are planned. ""We're also seeing India attempt to enter the chip manufacturing space. A country that has a strong history in chip design but will be starting from scratch in manufacturing,"" Ms Dohmen added. ""India are looking to be a big player in the space, and with intensifying competition with China. This has prompted the US and other allied countries to strengthen tech cooperation with India."" It all sounds very positive but building computer chip plants is not easy. Plans by TSMC to build advanced chips in Arizona have run into trouble, with the company blaming a shortage of skilled workers.  Others worry that the rush to build plants in Europe and the US, will just mirror what already exists in Asia.   ""There's a risk of duplication and wastefulness across the industry,"" Ms Dohmen said. Meanwhile, Mr Moore predicts more diversification in how semiconductors are made and what they're used for. ""You go from tens of billions of connected things to hundreds of billions and trillions of connected things, ultimately you end up with that very challenging element of not being able to supply to it, and so alternative supplies in high volume are what are going to be required. ""And being able to provide those cost effectively and at scale - that's the big challenge."""
geopolitical tensions,Top Ethiopian engineer 'took his own life',2024-09-15,2018-09-07,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-45447888,"Top Ethiopian engineer Simegnew Bekele, whose death from a bullet wound in July sparked a huge outcry, took his own life, police say. Mr Simegnew's body was found in a car in the main square of Ethiopia's capital, Addis Ababa. The engineer was in charge of the country's controversial multi-billion-dollar project to dam the Nile. Spontaneous demonstrations broke out in the wake of his death as some thought he had been murdered. At the time, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said he was ""saddened and utterly shocked"" by the news of Mr Simegnew's death. At his funeral, police used tear gas to control the thousands who had gone to pay their respects. After more than a month looking into the engineer's death, the authorities found ""that he used his own gun and killed himself,"" police chief Zeinu Jemal told journalists. Mr Simegnew's fingerprints had been found on the gun and the doors of the vehicle were all locked from the inside, the police chief added. He also said that the engineer had left messages for his secretary and child explaining that he might be going away for a while. Commenting on what could be behind the suicide, Mr Zeinu said preliminary investigations suggested that Mr Simegnew may have been under pressure because of the delays and the increasing cost of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam. But, he said, more investigations need to be carried out. The dam, which has been called the most ambitious infrastructure project ever achieved on the continent, was supposed to have been finished two years ago. Now, seven years into construction, it is only 65% complete, reports the BBC's Abebe Bayu. The project is also expected to go over its $4bn (£3.1bn) budget. Once built, the 1.8km (1.1 mile) wide and 155m (500ft 5in) high dam will triple the country's electricity production. But it has created geopolitical tension downstream on the Nile, with Egypt worried that the infrastructure project will put a strain on its water supply. Matina Stevis-Gridneff, Africa correspondent for the Wall Street Journal who knew Mr Simegnew, said he had come to represent Ethiopia's patriotic ambitions. ""He was someone who was extremely patriotic and had devoted his life to the betterment of his country,"" she told the BBC's Focus on Africa radio programme."
geopolitical tensions,Why Ethiopia is grieving for 'hero' dam engineer,2024-09-15,2018-07-29,By Tara John,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-44981490," The death of Simegnew Bekele, the project manager of the multi-billion-dollar Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, has been met by an outpouring of grief in Ethiopia.  Condolences flooded social media from journalists, businessmen academics, ambassadors and even flag-carrying Ethiopian Airlines after it was reported that Mr Simegnew's body was found in a car in the capital, Addis Ababa, on Thursday.  The police are investigating the circumstances of his death. He died as a result of a bullet wound and a hand gun was found in his car, which was parked in Meskel Square in the city centre. By the afternoon, hundreds had taken to the streets in the capital, as well as Mr Simegnew's hometown of Gondar, with protesters demanding ""justice"" for the late engineer.  To understand why a project manager has managed to elicit such shock and widespread mourning - normally seen in other countries after the death of royalty, celebrities or politicians - one has to look at what the Grand Ethiopian Dam has come to represent.  Straddling the Nile, the dam has been called the most ambitious infrastructure project ever achieved on the continent. Once built, the 1.8km (1.1 mile) wide and 155m (500ft 5in) high dam will triple the country's electricity production. The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, which is set to be Africa's biggest hydropower plant, is one of a number of large-scale infrastructure projects aimed at putting Ethiopia on course to become a middle-income nation by 2025.  Its scale and potential has brought rare unity in the country, which has faced political and ethnic strife over the years, Beletu Bulbula Sorsu, editor of BBC's Afaan Oromo Service, says.  ""The project unites Ethiopians,"" she says. Matina Stevis-Gridneff, Africa correspondent for the Wall Street Journal who knew Mr Simegnew, says he has come to represent these patriotic ambitions. ""He was someone who was extremely patriotic and had devoted his life to the betterment of his country,"" she told the BBC'S Focus on Africa radio programme.  ""He seemed to have devoted his entire life to Ethiopia's future by contributing what he could, which was his engineering skills."" The 53-year-old gained his degree in civil engineering from Addis Ababa University and went on to to lead two other dam projects - Gilgel Gibe I and Gilgel Gibe II dams.  He came to the public's attention in 2011, when he was put in charge of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam. Ms Beletu says he was frequently interviewed by the press and was widely perceived as being uncorrupted, modest and accessible.  ""He was not a 'big man,'"" she says of Mr Simegnew's honest nature. ""He behaved as if he was one of the the labourers working on the project."" Tibebeselassie Tigabu, from the BBC's Amharic Service, interviewed Mr Simegnew days before he died. ""He gave his life for the dam,"" she says, explaining that he spent most of his time around the dam, which was located in Ethiopia's Benishangul-Gumuz region near Sudan, nearly 1,000km north-west of his home in Addis Ababa.   ""It is a difficult place to live and he had been there for more than six years,"" she adds.  Mr Simegnew became the symbol of the dam and his death might become emblematic of the problems facing the project.  ""He was the spokesman for the project, he was the front man and I am not sure how that will be replaced so easily,"" Ms Stevis-Gridneff says. The dam is believed to be 60% complete, but there has been growing anger over delays. In the last week of July, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said that at the current pace of construction the dam might not be completed in the next 10 years.  Ethiopians are proud of the fact that the dam is a largely self-financed project. But a dollar shortage crisis has slowed down its construction, Ms Stevis-Gridneff says.  Then there is geopolitical tension the dam has created downstream with Egypt worried that the infrastructure project will put a strain on its water supply.  ""While the project is coming into trouble for practical reasons, I also see his death as a real blow to the symbolism of this project and how it was recorded in the psyche of normal Ethiopians,"" she says. Mr Simegnew was expected to be buried a day after his death. But a statement by a national committee set up to organise his funeral said it had postponed the burial.  They have instead made arrangements for a bigger funeral on Sunday 29 July ""that a national hero like him deserves""."
geopolitical tensions,Governments make big bets on the computer chip industry,2024-09-15,2024-01-12,By Hannah Mullane,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-67576918,"I'm at the UK's newest computer chip plant in Durham. Formerly a ceramic pipe factory, from the outside it looks like a  big warehouse.  But inside the vast space is being transformed into a sophisticated hub for the manufacturing of computer chips. Pragmatic Semiconductor has already built one production line, which the industry likes to call fabrication lines, or fab lines. Sealed off in its own large room, the production line has all the expensive machinery needed to make the computer chips, and the air inside is carefully controlled to avoid any contamination during production. Pragmatic has the money to build another such production line, and funding of £182m ($230m) announced late last year will fund production lines three and four. As well as from private investors, Pragmatic secured funding from the government-backed UK Infrastructure Bank and British Patient Capital, a subsidiary of British Business Bank. But the Cambridge-based company will need much more money to complete its plan to build eight production lines in the old pipe factory.  From phones and computers, to cars and washing machines, almost every product with an on-off switch relies on the production of computer chips, also known as semiconductors.

geopolitical tensions,Why did Armenia and Azerbaijan go to war?,2024-09-15,2020-09-28,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-54324772,"A peace deal has been agreed between Armenia and Azerbaijan, two former Soviet Union republics in the Caucasus region. It brings to an end six weeks of fierce fighting in which thousands of people were reported killed and many more displaced. At the heart of the conflict was the Nagorno-Karabakh region. It is recognised as part of Azerbaijan, but it is controlled by ethnic Armenians. The two countries fought a bloody war over the region in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and it has been the trigger for further violence in the years since. Nagorno-Karabakh is part of Azerbaijan, but its population is majority Armenian. As the Soviet Union saw increasing tensions in its constituent republics in the 1980s, Nagorno-Karabakh voted to become part of Armenia - sparking a war that stopped with a ceasefire in 1994.  Since then, Nagorno-Karabakh has remained part of Azerbaijan but is controlled by separatist ethnic Armenians backed by the Armenian government. Until recently, negotiations mediated by international powers had failed to deliver a peace agreement. Armenia is majority Christian while Azerbaijan is majority Muslim. Turkey has close ties to Azerbaijan, while Russia is allied with Armenia - although it also has good relations with Azerbaijan. The Caucasus is a strategically important mountainous region in south-east Europe. For centuries, different powers in the region - both Christian and Muslim - have vied for control there.  Modern-day Armenia and Azerbaijan became part of the Soviet Union when it formed in the 1920s. Nagorno-Karabakh was an ethnic-majority Armenian region, but the Soviets gave control over the area to Azerbaijani authorities. It was only as the Soviet Union began to collapse in the late 1980s that Nagorno-Karabakh's regional parliament officially voted to become part of Armenia. Azerbaijan sought to suppress the separatist movement, while Armenia backed it. This led to ethnic clashes, and - after Armenia and Azerbaijan declared independence from Moscow - a full-scale war.  Tens of thousands died and up to a million were displaced amid reports of ethnic cleansing and massacres committed by both sides. Most of those displaced in the war were Azerbaijanis. Armenian forces gained control of Nagorno-Karabakh and areas adjacent to it before a Russian-brokered ceasefire was declared in 1994. After that deal, Nagorno-Karabakh remained part of Azerbaijan, but since then has mostly been governed by a separatist, self-declared republic, run by ethnic Armenians and backed by the Armenian government. It also established the Nagorno-Karabakh Line of Contact, separating Armenian and Azerbaijan forces. Peace talks have taken place since then, mediated by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) Minsk Group - a body set up in 1992 and chaired by France, Russia and the United States.  But clashes continued, and a serious flare-up in 2016 saw the deaths of dozens of troops on both sides. The conflict is further complicated by geopolitics. Nato member-state Turkey was the first nation to recognise Azerbaijan's independence in 1991. Former Azeri President Heydar Aliyev once described the two as ""one nation with two states"". Both share a Turkic culture and populations. Moreover, Turkey has no official relations with Armenia. In 1993 Turkey shut its border with Armenia in support of Azerbaijan during the war over Nagorno-Karabakh. Armenia meanwhile has had good relations with Russia. There is a Russian military base in Armenia, and both are members of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) military alliance. However, President Vladimir Putin also has maintained good relations with Azerbaijan. In 2018, Armenia underwent a peaceful revolution, sweeping long-time ruler Serzh Sargsyan from power. Protest leader Nikol Pashinyan became the prime minister after free elections that year. Mr Pashinyan agreed with Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev to de-escalate tensions and set up the first military hotline between the two countries.  But in August 2019 Mr Pashinyan told crowds of ethnic Armenians assembled in the main city in Karabakh, Stepanakert, that ""Artsakh is Armenia, full stop."" Artsakh is the Armenian name for Karabakh. The remarks angered Azerbaijan and were repeatedly condemned by President Aliyev. Fighting broke out in July this year on the international border between Armenia and Azerbaijan, some 300km (185 miles) away from Nagorno-Karabakh. By the end of the month Turkey's military was taking part in large-scale joint exercises in Azerbaijan. The latest conflict broke out on 27 September. Armenia said Azerbaijan fired the first shots. Azerbaijan said it was launching a ""counter-offensive"" in response to Armenian aggression.  Fighting came to an end in November when both sides agreed to sign a Russian-brokered peace deal. Under its terms, Azerbaijan holds on to several areas that it gained control of during the conflict and Armenia will withdraw troops from them. Almost 2,000 Russian peacekeepers will monitor the truce."
geopolitical tensions,China gains a foothold in Australia's backyard,2024-09-15,2022-03-29,By Frances Mao,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-60896824,"Late last week, a proposed security treaty between China and a tiny chain of islands in the Pacific sent shock waves across the ocean. The leaked draft signalled that China could deploy troops to the Solomon Islands - and potentially establish a naval base there. Nowhere was more alarmed than the Solomons' neighbour to the south, Australia - the bedrock regional partner of the Aukus alliance, a new security pact in the Pacific Ocean with the US and UK. ""The details of this deal are still uncertain. But even if it's smaller than the feared military base, it would be China's first foothold in the Pacific,"" says Prof Allan Gyngell from the Australian Institute of International Affairs. The Solomon Islands and Australia have long been interlinked. Since World War Two, Australia has been the islands' largest aid donor, development partner and until now the sole security partner. Australia's government was rocked and likely blindsided by the move, analysts say. Not that it hadn't been warned. Five years ago, Canberra sensed that China was encroaching on its ""backyard"" with Solomon internal politics at the time also driving up Chinese loans and economic investment.  That prompted Canberra to push back with a ""step-up"" policy - where it refocused attention on its ""Pacific family"" and ramped up its own aid flows. But China's elevation to security partner status alongside Australia, clearly exposes how Canberra's engagement policy has failed, analysts say.  ""The objective had to be to stop something like this happening. You can't read it any other way - this is a failure of Australian diplomacy,"" says Prof Gyngell. It's not just a big deal for Australia. The Aukus pact, announced only six months ago, is aimed at countering China's ambitions in the Indo-Pacific. The US and other Western allies have all expressed concern about it becoming another potential theatre of conflict. Solomons' Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare has stridently defended his nation's right to seek security deals with China - on top of existing infrastructure and other business investments. ""We have no intention, Mr Speaker, of pitching into any geopolitical power struggle,"" he told parliament on Tuesday, saying his nation would not ""pick sides"". He has not confirmed if the leaked draft was the finalised version. But the content of that draft was so broad and expansive, it caused immediate alarm. The agreement set out clauses where China could send navy ships for ""stopover and transition"" in the islands - raising concerns about a potential military base. It also allows for Beijing to deploy forces to protect Chinese people and Chinese projects on the islands. The Solomons could request China send ""police, armed police, military personnel and other law enforcement and armed forces"", according to the draft. ""You have the scope for China to deploy any kind of personnel… and it's not clearly defined the parameters of deployment or the authority those forces would have,"" said Mihai Sora, a Pacific Islands analyst from the Lowy Institute in Australia. Compared to the Solomon's only other security agreement - with Australia - it's much more far-reaching. Australia's arrangement is largely to do with peacekeeping, allowing for a rapid deployment of troops, when requested, to the Solomon Islands, which has a long history of violent unrest.  Last year, it was activated again when deadly riots broke out in the capital Honiara - prompting troops to be sent over from Australia, as well as New Zealand, Fiji and Vanuatu. The proposed security deal with China could alter the balance in the region. ""Security agreements have significance beyond just the terms they capture. They imply a degree of closeness, co-operation and trust between countries,"" said Mr Sora. A Chinese military presence in the Pacific will also completely disrupt the ""benign"" environment that's been enjoyed by nations for decades - and which is currently collectively maintained by Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific Islands Forum nations. Australia has raised concerns on how it could ""undermine the stability and security of our region"", while New Zealand spoke out against a ""potential militarisation of the region"". Analysts say the threat of China on Australia's doorstop isn't about invasion; it's about much more immediate short-term concerns, such as Beijing improving intelligence gathering and monitoring. Even a small Chinese military presence giving it a foothold in the South Pacific would be a consideration for Australia and a potential drain on its military resources. ""It's not so much about what would China's base in the Solomon Islands contribute in a time of conflict - we're nowhere near that,"" said Mr Sora.  ""When you establish a military presence in a region, it excludes that region, excludes access to that region for other countries."" He said a worst case scenario could be an escalation in tensions to the dynamics of the South China Sea, where Beijing has built artificial islands in contested waters and placed military installations on them to deny passage for other nation's naval and air forces. ""Up until now, Australia and other Pacific countries have enjoyed being in a benign zone and having the freedom to move within our zone in the Pacific. ""So this brings in a clear, hard strategic edge to that competition."""
geopolitical tensions,China moves warships after US hosts Taiwan's Tsai,2024-09-15,2023-04-04,By Rupert Wingfield-Hayes,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-65160872,"China has launched military drills in response to a much-anticipated meeting between Taiwan's president Tsai Ing-wen and US House Speaker Kevin McCarthy.  They met in California on Wednesday, a week after President Tsai was feted in New York with a leadership award.  Ms Tsai hailed their ""strong and unique partnership"", and Mr McCarthy said that arms sales to Taiwan must continue.  Beijing, in turn, has vowed a ""resolute response"" and sent warships into the waters around the self-governed island. Taiwan, it appears, is caught in the middle of a dangerous love triangle. The timing of Ms Tsai's visit is hardly a coincidence. In the US there is deep and growing hostility to China. And this is driving ever more open displays of support for Taiwan, with Democrats and Republicans competing to out-do each other.   It's a big reason former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was so keen on landing in Taipei last summer, despite the fact that it set off a furious reaction from China. The self-governed island, which Beijing claims as part of its territory, is arguably the biggest flashpoint between the US and China.  ""I was personally very opposed to the Pelosi visit,"" says professor William Stanton, former director of the American Institute in Taiwan. ""For a high-level politician from the US to make a visit to the island was just poking China without much reward. And the consequences were quite scary.""  Chinese missiles flew over the island as Beijing made blood-curdling threats. In capitals around the region governments began talking seriously about the timetable for a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. Despite that, as soon as he was elected house speaker this January, Mr McCarthy, a Republican, declared his intention to follow Ms Pelosi's example. But President Tsai decided that was not a good idea, Prof Stanton says.  ""I think it was quite clear that Kevin McCarthy wanted to pull a Pelosi,"" he says. ""But Tsai Ing-wen said, 'no thank you, how about we have tea together in California instead'.""  President Tsai may not want another contentious visit by a US leader to Taiwan just yet - but she also needs to show China that it will not succeed in shutting down contact between a democratically-elected government in Taipei and its most powerful ally in Washington.   And so, the meeting in California. Mr McCarthy has far from downplayed it, calling the meeting ""bipartisan"", despite China's warning that the US was ""playing with fire on the Taiwan question"".  Afterwards the White House said there was no need for Beijing to ""overreact"" to the meeting. This so-called ""transit diplomacy"" is crucial for Taiwan, says Wen-Ti Sung, a political scientist at the Australian National University.   Over the years, China has successfully poached many of Taiwan's formal allies, whittling down the number of governments that recognise Taipei to just 13. ""These international visits match Taiwan society's needs for international recognition,"" Mr Sung says. ""When there's an absence of international recognition, these other proxy indicators of international support are important to [the] Taiwanese.""  Meanwhile the Communist Party of China has mounted its own charm offensive, by inviting President Tsai's predecessor, Ma Ying-jeou, to tour the mainland.  Mr Ma went on an unprecedented five-city tour, ostensibly to pay homage to his ancestors. He has indeed visited their graves in central China. But the trip is also political. In fact, it's the first time a former president of Taiwan has ever been invited to the People's Republic of China since its founding in 1949.   ""Beijing is trying to soften the tone towards Taiwan... winning more hearts and minds, and also avoiding a surge of Taiwanese nationalism during the [2024] presidential campaign,"" Mr Sung says.  Mr Ma's visit, he adds, provided the necessary ""political cover"" to do that.  When he landed in Nanjing last week, Mr Ma made a strikingly political speech: ""The people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait are Chinese. And both are descendants of the Yan and Yellow Emperors.""  ""Beijing is being nice to Ma Ying-jeou because he represents capitulation,"" Prof Stanton says. ""He says 'we are all Chinese'. That's something he and the Chinese agree on, but it's not something the Taiwanese agree on.""  The risk in Mr Ma's strategy is that more than 60% of Taiwan's residents, according to surveys, describe themselves as Taiwanese, and not Chinese.  But there could also be a reward waiting in the wings. Surveys show that more than half of Taiwan believes war with China is now likely. And Mr Ma's aim is to convince Taiwanese voters that only his party - the Kuomintang (KMT) - can avoid that war, Mr Sung says.  ""It's about cementing his legacy as the bridge between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. And on a domestic political level Taiwan is starting its presidential campaign. The KMT argument is that we can bring peace with China.""  But the elephant in the room is the deteriorating relationship between Taiwan's two suitors - Washington and Beijing. That relationship is worse today than at any time since the US and China officially recognised each other in 1979, says Bonnie Glaser, head of the Asia programme at the German Marshall Fund of the United States.  ""They [Beijing] are not taking calls from President Biden or the Pentagon. Congress has declared China an existential threat,"" she says.  For decades Washington has managed a rather delicate status quo, acknowledging, if not supporting, Beijing's position that there is only one Chinese government - the one on the mainland. It has maintained official ties with that government, and not Taiwan, since 1979. But it has also remained a steadfast ally to Taipei, guaranteeing to help the island defend itself.  But the fear is that China now believes that the US is set on changing the status quo which has helped keep the peace in the Taiwan Strait for the last 40-odd years.  ""President Biden told Xi Jinping he is not using Taiwan as a weapon, that he does not support the separation of Taiwan from China,"" Ms Glaser says.  But such assurances are unlikely to amount to much in the wake of contentious state visits or official meetings with Taiwan's leaders, she adds.  So while Mr Ma tours China and Ms Tsai has tea in California, what Taiwan also needs is for Mr Xi to pick up the phone. "
geopolitical tensions,Taiwan's president quits as party leader after vote,2024-09-15,2022-11-26,By Nathan Williams,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-63768538,"Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen has resigned as head of the governing Democratic Progressive Party after its poor showing in local elections. The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) won several major races on Saturday, including in the capital Taipei. The vote has drawn global attention as Taiwan becomes a bigger geopolitical flashpoint between China and the US. President Tsai had framed the election as a vote for democracy amid rising tensions with China.  ""The election results were not as expected... I should shoulder all the responsibility and I resign as DPP chairwoman immediately,"" Ms Tsai, who will continue as president of the self-ruled island, told reporters. The elections for local councils and city mayors theoretically have a domestic focus, covering issues such as crime, housing and social welfare, and those elected will not have a direct say on Taiwan's policy regarding China. However, Ms Tsai and government officials urged voters to use the elections to send a message about standing up for democracy, as Beijing increases pressure on the island. Voters also rejected lowering the voting age from 20 to 18, in a referendum that was run alongside the local elections. The Chinese government sees Taiwan as a breakaway province that will, eventually, be part of the country. But many Taiwanese people consider their self-ruled island - with its own form of government and a democratic system - to be distinct. Tensions reached a peak in August when Beijing staged huge military drills around Taiwan in a protest against US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to the island. The US has long walked a tightrope over Taiwan. Officially, it has no formal ties with Taiwan, but has also pledged to supply the island with defensive weapons and stressed that any attack by China would cause ""grave concern"". There are two main political parties in Taiwan and they have differing approaches to China.  The Kuomintang (KMT), a party of conservative business champions, are traditionally seen as pro-China ""doves"".  They have advocated economic engagement with China and have appeared to be in favour of unification, though they strongly deny being pro-China. Their main rival is Ms Tsai's governing Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). Ms Tsai won by a landslide in the 2020 national election.  She has taken a strong stance towards China, saying Beijing needed to show Taiwan respect and that Taipei would not bow to pressure.   She was re-elected on a promise to stand up to Beijing. Locals told the BBC at the time that protests in Hong Kong and Beijing's subsequent crackdown on civil rights had raised concerns in Taiwan. "
geopolitical tensions,How a coffee in LA sparked a diplomatic row,2024-09-15,2018-08-17,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-45217936,"A bakery in the US has found itself at the centre of a geopolitical storm by giving a coffee to Taiwan's president. The LA branch of Taiwanese-owned 85C Bakery Cafe gave the coffee, along with an enthusiastic welcome, to Tsai Ing-wen when she dropped in last Sunday. But many Chinese customers - who visit the chain's branches in mainland China - were furious, calling for a boycott.  China regards Taiwan as part of its territory, and the Chinese public are often quick to jump on anything that is seen as endorsing Taiwanese independence.  Warmly welcoming Ms Tsai, the leader of a pro-independence party, was seen as unacceptable. Yet, when the bakery chain tried some damage control, quickly putting out a statement distancing itself from pro-independence sentiments, it only sparked more anger - this time in Taiwan, where people accused the company of bowing to Chinese pressure. Taiwan's status is a sensitive question.  It's a self-governed democracy and for all practical purposes has acted as an independent nation since 1950, when China's nationalist government was defeated by communist forces and fled there from the mainland.  China considers the island to be a renegade province - not a country in its own right - which will one day, by force if necessary, be fully reunited with the mainland.  China insists that other countries can only have diplomatic ties with China or Taiwan, not both.  And in recent years, Beijing has become increasingly assertive over its claims and what it says is a key question of national sovereignty.  Last weekend, President Tsai Ing-wen stopped over in Los Angeles on her way to visit some of Taiwan's few remaining diplomatic allies in South America.  During her stay, she paid a visit to 85C Bakery Cafe, a brand that started in Taiwan but has expanded to China and the US.  The local staff, apparently excited to host her, gave her a gift bag, and among smiles and photographs also handed her a brand mascot to sign.  Pictures of the visit were posted on Facebook by a member of her delegation, but have since been taken off his public timeline. Although Ms Tsai has been a moderate voice on the independence issue since her election, she is viewed by the mainland as a dangerous separatist. ""85C is a 'Taiwan independence' two-faced company,"" said one post on social media. ""We mainland Chinese should boycott this kind of garbage company."" Several food delivery services dropped the chain from their apps and shares in Gourmet Master, the bakery's parent company, fell 7.5%, Bloomberg said this cost the company $120m (£94m). The company, which makes more than half of its global revenue in mainland China, was quick to put out its statement.  It reiterated its ""firm support"" for the 1992 Consensus - a loose agreement between Taiwan and China that there is only one China, without defining what that means. The cafe said it was against anything that would ""divide the feelings of the compatriots on the two sides"", which were ""the same family"". Yet the attempted damage control did not work very well.  Chinese customers cried foul when they realised the statement was only published on the company's mainland website, seeing it as an attempt to mollify the public without taking a clear anti-independence stance.  In Taiwan, it sparked accusations that the bakery was bowing to pressure from Beijing.  A spokesman for the presidential office in Taipei called accused China of carrying out an ""uncivilised act"" which would ""hinder the world market order and freedom of speech"". This is far from the first time that China's vociferous defence of its territorial claims has spilled over into the business world.  Earlier this year US clothing company Gap apologised for selling T-shirts featuring a map of China that did not show Taiwan and other disputed territories claimed by China. Japanese retail chain Muji was recently fined in China for listing Taiwan as a country on some of its packaging. And over the past few months, Beijing has targeted Western firms - particularly hotels and airlines - to change their websites to show Taiwan as part of China and not a separate entity. So on many airlines, where you previously would have booked a trip to ""Taipei, Taiwan"" you will now be booking for ""Taipei, China"".  In January, the website of Marriott Hotels was shut down in China because it listed Taiwan as a separate country. The website changed its listing and apologised.  But this week, one hotel in Taiwan said it was cutting all ties with the Marriott franchise as a result, accusing it of giving in to the Chinese demands. "
geopolitical tensions,How bad is Nato's climate change problem?,2024-09-15,2021-06-14,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-57476349,"The world's most powerful defence alliance agreed on Monday to step up efforts to tackle climate change for the first time.  Nato - the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation - said its members have pledged to ""significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions from military activities"" in a way that does not impact personnel safety or the effectiveness of their operations. In a statement released after a summit in Brussels, the group also asked the organisation's leader to develop a realistic, ambitious and concrete target for reducing Nato emissions and to assess the feasibility of reaching net zero emissions by 2050. The statement described climate change as ""one of the defining challenges of our times"". It said Nato wanted to be a leading international force in understanding and adapting to the ways climate change will impact world security. Nato is a powerful political and military alliance between 30 European and North American countries. It is no secret that militaries use arsenals of gas-guzzling equipment - like armoured vehicles and aircraft - which are sometimes hauled along with troops around the world. But getting accurate data on their environmental impact is notoriously difficult.  A report commissioned by some members of the European Parliament earlier this year said that because militaries are often exempt from publicly reporting their greenhouse gas emissions, it can be difficult to accurately measure how big their environmental impact is.  One study published in 2019 suggested that if the US military were a country, it would rank as the 47th largest emitter in the world on fuel usage alone. But this is not a uniquely US issue.  The International Military Council on Climate and Security (IMCCS) says in its latest annual report that defence remains the single largest consumer of hydrocarbons - like fuel and gas - in the world. In Monday's statement Nato said it would develop a ""mapping methodology to help Allies measure greenhouse gas emissions from military activities and installations"", which could help set ""voluntary goals"" to try and reduce these emissions.  Reuters news agency, previewing Monday's announcement, pointed out that some Nato allies are already trying to make their armed forces greener by using energy sources like solar power. The International Military Council on Climate and Security - a separate group of senior military leaders - said in its annual report that the long life-span of military equipment, such as warships, means that defence has locked itself into relying on fossil fuels for ""many years to come"". ""This is why it is imperative that we start now by investing massively into research and development of carbon neutral fuels and propulsion systems for military vehicles on land, sea, and air,"" the 2021 report stated, pointing out any advancements in technology could also have benefits for civilian sectors, like aviation, too.  There is growing awareness of the challenges that climate change may pose to the world's security. Climate change is associated with an increase in extreme weather events like heatwaves, flooding and droughts - which often require humanitarian assistance and can cause mass displacement. Experts say environmental changes from climate change can also act as ""threat multipliers"" - intensifying existing tensions over resource scarcity or sparking regional destabilisation and conflicts. The UN Refugee Agency says that weather events are already displacing about 20 million people a year on average. For Nato members, extreme weather could also risk the welfare of their military personnel abroad, or the integrity of their operations and equipment.  ""Climate change puts our resilience and civil preparedness to the test, affects our planning and the resilience of our military installations and critical infrastructure, and may create harsher conditions for our operations,"" the Nato statement said.  There is increased public awareness about the dangers and risks of climate change and scrutiny of the way governments are responding to it.  The G7 this week also agreed to new climate measures ahead of COP26 - the latest UN Climate Change Conference - being held in Scotland later this year. Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg is personally passionate about the subject, having previously served as an environment minister in Norway and as a UN special envoy on climate change. He has been publicly pushing the organisation to prioritise climate change for some time.  ""As the planet heats up, our weather becomes wilder, warmer, windier and wetter, putting communities under pressure as sources of food, fresh water and energy are threatened,"" he wrote in an opinion piece in September. ""We can see this today in the Sahel region of Africa, where climate change is driving migration. In the Arctic where as the ice melts, geopolitical tensions heat up. Or here in Europe, where record-breaking floods and wildfires increase year on year."" Monday's statement also comes after a big ideological shift in the White House, which is Nato's biggest financial contributor. Donald Trump was openly sceptical of both US support of Nato and global efforts to combat climate change but his replacement, President Joe Biden, has made both much more central to his policies. After he took office, President Biden almost immediately reversed a decision to pull the US out of the Paris climate agreement and issued an executive order to tackle the climate crisis at home and abroad, including in the areas of foreign policy and national security.

geopolitical tensions,Syria war: Brutal endgame in Idlib risks spilling over,2024-09-15,2020-02-28,Jonathan Marcus,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-51669423,"The crisis in Syria's Idlib province - already a humanitarian catastrophe - is fast becoming a geopolitical one as well.  The Syrian conflict has long had a dual aspect - both civil war and proxy war, with several outside players backing various parties to further their own strategic ends.  Now, as the conflict in north-western Syria comes to a head, these two aspects are merging to form a powder keg, whose explosion could have profound implications way beyond the Middle East.  Idlib is the last Syrian province where significant territory remains in rebel hands. In 2017, it appeared that Russia and Iran (the main backers of the Syrian regime), and Turkey (the main supporter of some of the rebel groups there) had come to an understanding:  Was this a real way forward or a cynical ploy on the part of all three countries to buy time?  It's hard to say. But the renewed Syrian government offensive into Idlib, backed by Russian air power and Iranian proxies on the ground, has effectively ended any hope of a deal. Syrian regime forces and their allies have made significant progress, taking back one key highway from rebel control.  In the process, a number of the Turkish positions have become isolated. Over the past few weeks Turkish and Syrian force have come into conflict; Ankara has reinforced its troops; and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan issued an ultimatum.  He called upon Syrian government forces to withdraw from areas that had been designated as part of a de-escalation zone by the end of February. If not, he threatened a significant military response. The fighting continued anyway.  Earlier this week. Syrian opposition forces - who are backed by Turkey - sought to retake the town of Saraqeb, important for the control of another strategic highway, the M-4.  Only on Thursday, President Erdogan commented that ""the developments in Idlib are now in favour of Turkey"". Then, later on Thursday, came the devastating air strike on Turkish forces.  Details of what actually happened are only slowly emerging.  The Turks have been at pains to blame the Syrian Air Force, though it's clear that Russian jets have very much been involved in some of the recent fighting.  The possibility, let's put it no stronger than that, that Moscow's war planes may have hit forces of a Nato country operating in Syria, underscores the gravity of what is going on.  But whatever the nationality of the aircraft involved, this seems, at least from Turkish reports, to be anything but an accidental attack.  They speak of a Turkish army resupply convoy being hit, with the jets subsequently targeting the Turkish outpost itself.  Turkey has responded with heavy fire against Syrian positions. The scene is set for a full-scale confrontation between Turkey and Syria.   This leaves all sorts of questions.  Will Ankara or Damascus back down? Can Moscow - hardly a neutral party - in some way encourage de-escalation?   And is there any way to persuade the Syrian regime to halt its wider offensive in Idlib?  This appears doubtful since Syrian President Bashar al-Assad seems intent on taking back control of the area, and the Russians have already been backing him to this end.  These are the immediate questions.  But there are others of a more fundamental nature; questions that are thrown into starker light by what is happening on the ground. What of the human tragedy that is unfolding? In the Syrian winter, hundreds of thousands of civilians are displaced, many for the second or third time.  Turkey has already taken in some 3.7 million refugees. It is estimated that there could be some two million more people fleeing towards the Turkish border.  For all its political manoeuvring, driven in large part by its concern to prevent any autonomous Kurdish area emerging on its frontier, Turkey has been generous towards refugees.  This now is becoming a controversial issue in Turkish domestic politics, and Turkey's exasperation may lead it to send a wave of refugees towards Europe.  It has always argued that the Syria problem is not just a Turkish one but a European one as well.  But President Erdogan has few friends in the West at the moment. Turkey's relations with Nato and Washington are strained; damaged both by its assault on Kurdish forces inside northern Syria (long-time allies of the US) and its tilt towards Moscow, best exemplified by its decision, over strong US opposition, to purchase Russian surface-to-air missiles.   What we may be seeing in Idlib are the limits of President Erdogan's foreign policy; a failed attempt to triangulate between Washington and Moscow.  Nonetheless he may still have some leverage with the Russians - they will be reluctant to push Turkey back into Washington's arms.  It is all beyond being a terrible mess, and there seems no external player who can act to reduce the tensions, other than perhaps Russia.   This is the measure of the Trump administration's failure in the Middle East.  US Defence Secretary Mark Esper spoke with his Turkish counterpart on Thursday, and according to a Pentagon statement, the two men discussed ""the Assad regime's brutal aggression in Idlib, which is backed by Russia and Iran"".  But Washington has largely been a bystander in Syria ever since President Trump seemed to acquiesce in Turkey's last major incursion into Syria.  Maybe a new human wave of Syrian refugees will encourage some concerted international action.  But the brutal end-game in Idlib and the plight of so many people remains a terrible indictment of the current state of global diplomacy and the self-interested posturing of so many players.  "
geopolitical tensions,How Europe's relationship with Joe Biden turned sour,2024-09-15,2021-09-02,Mark Lowen,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-58416848,"A series of disagreements, most notably over Afghanistan, have some European leaders revising their expectations about President Joe Biden, and thinking more about a future untethered to the US. From a white-knuckle grip with Donald Trump to an arm on the shoulder with President Biden, Emmanuel Macron's greetings tell the story of how EU leaders saw the change of US administrations. At a Nato summit in May 2017, the French president dug his fingertips into President Trump's hand, staring him in the face. ""It wasn't innocent"", Mr Macron later said. ""In my bilateral dialogues, I won't let anything pass."" Roll forward four years to the recent G7 summit in Cornwall, Joe Biden's first as US president, and again Mr Macron grasped the moment. As the cameras snapped, he walked across the beach with his arm around Mr Biden. The body language shift was clear: the two sides arm-in-arm once again. But in capitals across Europe, from London to Berlin, Afghanistan has soured the sweetness of Joe Biden's honeymoon. It's not the fact of the withdrawal itself that has rankled but the US's lack of coordination with allies, particularly since the Nato mission at the time of the drawdown comprised troops from 36 countries, three-quarters of whom were non-American, leading to an international scramble to evacuate.  The German deployment in Afghanistan was its first major combat mission since World War II, so the frustration at how it ended runs deep. Armin Laschet, Germany's conservative candidate for chancellor ahead of elections later this month, called the US withdrawal ""the greatest debacle that Nato has experienced since its foundation"".  Czech President Milos Zeman labelled it ""cowardice"", adding that ""the Americans have lost the prestige of a global leader"". ""Expectations were very high when Joe Biden came in - probably too high, they were unrealistic,"" Carl Bildt, Sweden's former Prime Minister, told the BBC. ""His 'America is back' suggested a golden age in our relations. But it didn't happen and there's been a shift in a fairly short period of time. The complete lack of consultations over the withdrawal has left a scar."" A Pew Research Center poll last year found that the percentage of Germans who had confidence in the US president to do the right thing in world affairs jumped from 10% under Donald Trump to 79% with Joe Biden. The rise in France was almost identical.  But, says Nathalie Loiseau, France's Europe Minister until 2019, ""many EU countries were in a state of denial. They thought they should wait until Trump was gone and we'd go back to the 'old normal'. But that 'old normal' isn't alive anymore. I hope it's a wake-up call for us."" For Europe's leaders, the manner of the American withdrawal - and Joe Biden's comments that the US would no longer send troops to ""remake other countries"" - has echoes of Donald Trump's ""America First"" policy.  But while there's frustration here over Washington's lack of communication with EU capitals, it is perhaps too early to tell how much that will dent the widespread relief over the change of US administrations. ""The main rift under Trump had less to do with specific foreign policy decisions and more that we didn't share the same values all of a sudden,"" says Nathalie Tocci, an adviser to the EU's foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, and a visiting professor at Harvard.  ""The real trauma of Trumpism was not only 'America First' but that he seemed to get on more with the Xis and Putins. That we're on the same side hasn't been questioned with Afghanistan. What has changed is the growing preoccupation in Europe that as the US withdraws from the world, it may be very committed to protecting values in America - but what about elsewhere?"" Indeed, some see in the Afghanistan issue simply a continuation of the long-standing American tendency to go it alone. ""Is this new?"" asks Mrs Tocci. ""It's always been the European complaint about the US. But now it's the Americans acting without coordinating their leaving, not going in."" That feeling - that Europe has been here time and again - has thrown the debate about ""strategic autonomy"" back into focus: long a goal of EU foreign policy, particularly from France, which often craves a more equal geopolitical balance with the United States.  ""Some other countries, such as the UK and Germany, always thought they could rely mostly on the US for security,"" says Mrs Loiseau, the former French minister. ""So of course they're fearing times have changed. But we've often said we should rethink how Nato works. We should not remain in a state of denial.""  The Afghanistan chaos comes on top of other simmering transatlantic rows, which are deepening the sense that Europe's warmth towards Joe Biden is cooling off. His administration's failure to fully lift Trump-era trade tariffs on European goods, his call to waive patents for Covid vaccines - again seemingly made without consultation with the EU - and his refusal to lift pandemic-related travel bans on EU countries have raised hackles.  The European Commission Vice President Margaritis Schinas says he's cancelled his planned trip to the United States next week ""because I do not find the lack of reciprocity on travel rules fair"". The EU has now removed the US from its travel ""safe list"": seen by some as an illustration of growing tensions. The EU's concerns are now two-fold. First, that the Afghanistan mayhem spurs another migrant crisis, reawakening echoes of 2015, when more than a million people fleeing Syria and elsewhere arrived in Europe.  And second, whether an America more focused on itself, combined initially with a Germany without Angela Merkel and a France whose president faces imminent re-election, leaves a power vacuum that Russia and China are already filling. And that it will prompt actions, such as Beijing's increasing threats to Taiwan, without fear of Western reprisals. ""There was a time when the US talked about upholding the global order,"" says Carl Bildt.  ""But that is not the language now coming out of the White House. Expectations for a revival of the transatlantic relationship have been deflated. And one is resigned to an America that does it its own way."""
geopolitical tensions,Shell reports lower profits as energy prices cool,2024-09-15,2024-02-01,Michael Race,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68164030,"Oil and gas giant Shell has reported lower annual profits due to energy prices falling last year. Profits were $28.2bn (£22.3bn) in 2023, down from $39.9bn in 2022 which was the company's highest earnings in its 115-year history. Energy firms made record earnings when oil and gas prices soared in the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine amid fears of supply problems. Households bills have eased since 2022, but remain at a high level. The price of gas and electricity, as well as petrol and diesel, first began to climb after the end of Covid lockdowns, but surged in March 2022 after the outbreak of war in Ukraine due to concerns over supplies. The price of Brent crude oil reached nearly $128 a barrel following the invasion, but has since fallen back and is currently at about $80. Gas prices also spiked but have come down from their highs. The 2022 surge in prices led to all energy companies, including the likes of Shell and BP, to make bumper profits. In response, the government introduced a windfall tax - called the Energy Profits Levy  - on the ""extraordinary"" earnings of firms on their UK operations to help fund a scheme to subsidise gas and electricity bills. Shell confirmed it paid £178m in UK windfall tax for 2022. A company spokeswoman said the company paid £1.1bn in overall tax in the UK for 2023, of which £240m was taxed under the Energy Profits Levy. Meanwhile, Shell said it returned $23bn to its shareholders in 2023, and was now increasing its dividend by 4% and beginning a $3.5bn share buyback programme over the next three months. Shell said the fall in profit last year was a result of lower oil and gas prices, as well as lower volumes being traded and lower margins for refining, which is the process when crude oil, the raw material extracted from the earth, is made into products such as diesel. It added 2023 saw higher liquefied natural gas (LNG) trading. Many European countries turned to LNG as an alternative source of energy after Russia cut its supplies of natural gas to continent.  As a result, the British company posted profits of $7.3bn in the final three months of 2023, which exceeded analysts' expectations but was down from a record $9.8bn in the same period the year before. Jamie Maddock, energy analyst at wealth management business Quilter Cheviot, said Shell's strong results were driven by its gas division. He warned that oil and gas prices were likely to remain ""unpredictable"" in 2024 with geopolitical tensions remaining high in the Middle East. ""It is these sorts of environments that energy giants can thrive in, as we saw in 2022, so it wouldn't be a shock to see Shell continuing to deliver over the course of the year,"" he added. Jonathan Noronha-Gant, senior campaigner at Global Witness, accused Shell of ""choosing climate-wrecking U-turns and shareholder pay-outs"" as a result of its strong profits, rather than ""investing in clean energy"". Wael Sawan, Shell's chief executive, said the company in 2024 would continue to ""simplify our organisation with a focus on delivering more value with less emissions""."
geopolitical tensions,Who could succeed Algeria's ailing president?,2024-09-15,2019-03-29,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-47754155,"After weeks of protests against President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, the Algerian army's chief of staff has called for the presidency to be declared vacant. BBC Monitoring profiles the country's main centres of power and possible successors to Mr Bouteflika. Algeria's military has always had a pivotal role in politics, which was strengthened during the 1990s - the ""Black Decade"". This is when the army annulled elections and fought a fierce civil war with Islamists. However, President Bouteflika has managed to push some of the generals aside. In 2015, he sidelined the once powerful head of intelligence, Mohamed Mediene (known by his alias General Toufik). He was the last of the ""Janviéristes"", who steered Algerian politics for over 20 years after cancelling the January 1991 polls. However, pro-government media and politicians hailed the move as a step towards democracy and demilitarisation of the state. Lt Gen Ahmed Gaid Salah called for Mr Bouteflika to be declared unfit to rule on 26 March, adding to commentators' suspicions that he has presidential ambitions. A French parliamentary report published in January 2017 said Lt Gen Gaid Salah ""sees himself as a likely successor"".  This is despite regular affirmations that he would not betray his ""liberation war brother-in-arms"".  The army chief of staff has managed to weather shifting fortunes and has often helped Mr Bouteflika undermine the position of other generals.  He was rewarded for his loyalty with the title of ""deputy defence minister"" ahead of Mr Bouteflika's last re-election. The president remains the country's official minister of defence. He has repeatedly taken credit for successful counter-terrorism efforts and his ministry's budget has climbed steeply in the last few years, despite a budgetary clampdown due to low oil prices. He also obtained legislation passed to prevent ousted generals from speaking out against him. However, some Algerian media outlets suggest there are tensions between Lt Gen Gaid Salah and the presidential clan. The president's trust is notoriously hard to earn. He is mostly surrounded by family members and childhood acquaintances. A notable member of this close-knit circle is Chakib Khelil, who grew up with Mr Bouteflika in their native Oujda in Morocco. He went on to become Mr Bouteflika's minister of energy, president of state oil giant Sonatrach and chairman of Opec. After six years on the run over corruption scandals, Mr Khelil made a flamboyant comeback to Algeria in 2016, touring the highly-regarded Soufi lodges and drawing ample coverage from the press.  Many reports speculate that he lobbied for his presidential bid during his exile in the US, where he studied. He denies being a US passport holder, which could disqualify him from running in presidential polls. The leadership intentions of the president's younger brother have long been the subject of speculation, and many Algerians believe he is already the de facto ruler of the country.  The former physics lecturer and trade unionist joined his brother at the presidency as a special adviser as soon as he assumed office in April 1999. When Abdelaziz Bouteflika suffered a stroke in 2013, his brother Said travelled with him to France and oversaw his treatment. He is often described as being the president's gatekeeper, leading the presidential clan and protecting its interests from behind the scenes. The collapse of potential rivals, including his once-untouchable protégé Amar Saadani, suggested he will want a bigger role than just being one of a number of kingmakers. However, the protest movement in Algeria may have moderated his ambitions. In the 1990s, after nearly a decade of a bloody civil conflict, Algeria's generals chose Mr Bouteflika as a consensus veteran diplomat, seen as an intellectual, to rehabilitate the country without encroaching on their considerable powers.  Little did they know that Mr Bouteflika would be able to play them off against each other for four terms, mastering the game of shifting alliances to displace his rivals one by one. Similar candidates today would include Mouloud Hamrouche and Ali Benflis, two former prime ministers who have also previously run for the highest office. One of these two insider reformists could be called upon if the ruling elites come under pressure to modernise the state. Recently dismissed Ahmed Ouyahia was prime minister three times and now leads the ruling coalition's Democratic National Rally (RND). He is reputed to be close to the president, but is seen as an enforcer, not a leader. Amar Saadani, once thought to be the frontrunner to succeed, was forced to resign from his office as the head of the ruling National Liberation Front (FLN) party and to run instead for a seat in the upcoming parliamentary elections. His political demise was brought about by the many powerful enemies he made in aggressively critical statements to the press. Both men were among the first to support Lt Gen Gaid Salah in his call for enacting Article 102 of the constitution to declare the presidential post vacant. Lakhdar Brahimi is one of Algeria's most respected veteran diplomats. He held key posts in the foreign ministry, culminating in his two-year term as minister of foreign affairs at the beginning of Algeria's civil war. Mr Brahimi went on to have a successful career at the highest level in the UN General Secretariat. His mission as a joint UN-Arab League envoy to Syria brought him back to the fore in 2012, and his resignation after the failure of the Geneva talks in 2014 earned him respect from Algerian pundits.  Former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon described him as ""one of the world's most brilliant diplomats"". Mr Brahimi has since voiced his opinions on several regional issues. In contrast to his country's longstanding stance, he as called for Algeria to intervene in Libya, for the International Criminal Court to prosecute war crimes committed in Syria, and for Morocco and Algeria to reopen their shared border. In June 2015, the US geopolitical analysis firm Stratfor intimated that he was viewed positively by international partners. Several North African media outlets interpreted this as Western backing for his eventual candidacy. This would normally have sparked a backlash in Algeria's perpetual war of clans, but Mr Brahimi was welcomed back in Algiers's inner circles, meeting Mr Bouteflika several times and receiving an award from the country's state-sponsored human rights body. However, Mr Brahimi's chances of wielding real power might be dented somewhat by his age. He was born in 1934 and is older than the ailing president. Algeria's opposition is fragmented and has failed in its attempts to present a single candidate for the presidential elections, which were cancelled after protests broke out across the country. The historic opposition parties are the secular Socialist Forces Front (FFS) and Rally for Culture and Democracy (RND). They can regularly mobilise voters in the Kabylie region and the capital Algiers and had been calling for a boycott of the presidential election before the protest movement started. They were also the first to denounce Lt Gen Gaid Salah's call for declaring the presidency vacant, saying it amounted to ""a coup d'etat"" and that it sought to ""revive the regime"". Other opposition parties were intending to compete in the elections and were meeting over electoral alliances when the protests took them by surprise.  Former Prime Minister Ali Benflis, who ran against Mr Bouteflika in 2014, had a more measured response and asked for more guarantees for the transition of power. The Islamist leaders Abdalla Jaballah and Abderrazak Makri made similar comments, with Mr Makri seeking to guarantee a role for his Muslim Brotherhood-linked party in a transitional administration before elections. Mr Benflis has more in common with insiders who fell out of grace such as Mr Ouyahia and Mr Saadani than with opposition activists. A popular lawyer in his native Batna and a founder of the state-run Algerian League for Human Rights, he climbed the ranks in the bar association and was appointed minister of justice in 1988. The following year, he was on the central committee of the ruling FLN. He resigned as justice minister in the early days of the crisis leading to Algeria's decade-long civil war. As Mr Bouteflika returned in 1999 to end the unrest, Mr Benflis ran his successful presidential bid and became his chief aid. Mr Bouteflika named him as prime minister the following year. He also became secretary-general of the FLN. However, he was dismissed in 2003 as his popularity grew and his presidential ambition became apparent. He then attempted two failed presidential bids, running against Mr Bouteflika in 2004 and 2014. In recent years, he has been received in Western capitals as a potential successor to Mr Bouteflika. He had high hopes for the 2019 election, publishing a biography - Ali Benflis: An Algerian Destiny - in France months prior to the race, which depicted him as ""the man to lead a transition"". One of the most remarkable transformations in Algerian society under Mr Bouteflika's rule has been the rise of the business tycoons, a class of oligarchs who came to counterbalance the once-all-powerful generals. Often closely linked to political backers, they amassed wealth, power and media clout. Issad Rebrab, one of the richest men in Algeria, has clearly expressed his political opinions, and opposed Mr Bouteflika's 2014 re-election.  In 2016, the authorities stopped him from achieving his dream of building his own media empire when they prevented him from purchasing one of the country's largest media groups, El Khabar. Mr Rebrab already owns the pro-opposition French-language daily Liberté. Media mogul Ali Haddad has given positive coverage of the army chief's call to declare Mr Bouteflika unfit to be president.  He also appears to rub shoulders with those in power. In February 2017, He stood side-by-side with French presidential hopeful Emmanuel Macron at a news conference when he visited Algiers. In an interview with Algerian news website TSA in 2017, Mr Haddad did not hide his proximity to the powerful, including Said Bouteflika and other military and civilian officials whom he described as ""Algerian patriots"". Mr Haddad was identified by the Algerian and French press as being one of the main financiers of Mr Bouteflika's 2014 re-election campaign. Mr Haddad went from managing his family's small hotel in Kabylie to owning a construction empire, a football club, a partnership with a US healthcare provider and several media outlets. But his real speciality is obtaining public contracts, some of which have sparked controversy, like the costly and long-running East-West national highway project. On 27 March, his Le Temps d'Algerie newspaper gave positive coverage to the chief of staff's call to enact Article 102. Hours later, he resigned from his post at Algeria's business forum. "
geopolitical tensions,"Maersk cuts 10,000 jobs as shipping demand falls",2024-09-15,2023-11-03,Michael Race,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-67307248,"One of the world's biggest shipping firms is to cut 3,500 more jobs due to lower freight rates and demand. AP Moller-Maersk already cut 6,500 roles earlier this year as part of ""rigorous cost containment measures"" but said more redundancies were needed. The firm, which transports goods for major retailers such as Nike, said profits had plunged by 92% in its most recent quarterly results.  It said ""worsening"" prices for shipping by sea required further job cuts. The cost of shipping goods soared in the first year of Covid when lockdowns lifted and businesses began to resume trading, increasing their orders for stock. Such high demand led to congestion and logistical problems at UK ports. There was also a shortage of shipping containers in Asia, which helped drive up inflation. More recently, however, high inflation and rising interest rates have curbed spending and dampened demand. Maersk previously warned in August of a steeper decline in global demand for shipping containers by sea this year. The Danish company said in a trading update on Friday that there had been ""significant pressure on rates"" in the past few months. ""Our industry is facing a new normal with subdued demand, prices back in line with historical levels and inflationary pressure on our cost base,"" said Maersk chief executive Vincent Clerc. ""Since the summer, we have seen overcapacity across most regions triggering price drops and no noticeable uptick in ship recycling or idling."" The job losses will reduce Maersk's global workforce to below 100,000. Some 2,500 of the latest 3,500 roles will be cut in the coming months, with the rest in 2024.  It estimates that the redundancies will save the business £600m next year,but has not revealed the locations of the cuts or the types of roles going. The company, which controls about one-sixth of global container trade, has already decreased its staff to about 103,500 from 110,000 earlier this year. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said Maersk's latest results suggested ""the global economy is losing speed"". ""If you want an economic bellwether, look no further than Maersk, as its status as one of the world's largest container shipping companies makes it a fair proxy for global growth,"" he said. ""Transportation demand will be strong if the economy is going well, but the opposite will apply if there are clouds on the horizon."" In the three months to September, Maersk's pre-tax profits fell to $691m compared to $9.1bn in the same period last year. Sales dropped to $12.1bn from $22.7bn. Mr Mould said the current situation with container shipping was being made worse due to overcapacity in the industry, which he said was ""great if you are the person paying to move goods from A to B as it should enable you to barter for a lower price, [but] terrible if you're the one owning and operating the ships"". Last week Garry Grant, founder of The Entertainer toy company, told the BBC's Today programme the cost of freight for the retailer's goods had ""collapsed over the last six months, back to the pre-pandemic levels"". He said the cost of one container was about $2,000 now compared to $18,000 a year ago, which he said had ""really helped us to enable us to bring down some prices and, in most cases, make sure that prices haven't gone up"". Following Maersk's results, shares in the group slid 11.1% early on Friday. The firm said it would maintain its expectations for revenue and profits, but warned both figures would land at the lower end of its estimates. Furthermore, it cautioned that ""a slowing global economy, risks of financial stress and a long list of geopolitical tensions, ranging from tense China-US relations, war in Ukraine and in the Middle East can wipe out the improvements expected"" in the final three months of this year as well as volumes in 2024."
geopolitical tensions,Tensions grow as China ramps up mining for green tech,2024-09-15,2024-04-29,By Global China Unit,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-68896707,"Earlier this year, Ai Qing was woken up in the middle of the night by angry chants outside her dormitory in northern Argentina.  She peered out of the window to see Argentine workers surrounding the compound and blockading the entrance with flaming tyres.  ""It was getting scary because I could see the sky being lit up by the fire. It had become a riot,"" says Ms Ai, who works for a Chinese company extracting lithium from salt flats in the Andes mountains, for use in batteries.  The protest, sparked by the firing of a number of Argentine staff, is just one of a growing number of cases of friction between Chinese businesses and host communities, as China - which already dominates the processing of minerals vital to the green economy - expands its involvement in mining them.   It was just 10 years ago that a Chinese company bought the country's first stake in an extraction project within the ""lithium triangle"" of Argentina, Bolivia and Chile, which holds most of the world's lithium reserves.  Many further Chinese investments in local mining operations have followed, according to mining publications, and corporate, government and media reports. The BBC calculates that based on their shareholdings, Chinese companies now control an estimated 33% of the lithium at projects currently producing the mineral or those under construction.  But as Chinese businesses have expanded, they have faced allegations of abuses similar to those often levelled at other international mining giants.  For Ai Qing, the tyre-burning protest was a rude awakening. She had expected a quiet life in Argentina, but found herself involved in conflict mediation because of her knowledge of Spanish.  ""It wasn't easy,"" she says.  ""Beyond the language, we have to tone down many things, like how management thinks the employees are simply lazy and too reliant on the union, and how locals think Chinese people are only here to exploit them.""  The BBC Global China Unit has identified at least 62 mining projects across the world, in which Chinese companies have a stake, that are designed to extract either lithium or one of three other minerals key to green technologies - cobalt, nickel and manganese.  All are used to make lithium-ion batteries - used in electric vehicles - which, along with solar panels, are now high industrial priorities for China. Some projects are among the largest producers of these minerals in the world.   China has long been a leader in refining lithium and cobalt, with a share of global supply reaching 72% and 68% respectively in 2022, according to the Chatham House think tank.  Its capacity to refine these and other critical minerals has helped the country reach a point where it made more than half of the electric vehicles sold worldwide in 2023, has 60% of the global manufacturing capacity for wind turbines, and controls at least 80% of each stage in the solar panel supply chain.    China's role in the sector has made these items cheaper and more accessible globally.  But it's not only China that will need to mine and process minerals needed for the green economy. The UN says that if the world is to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, their use must increase six-fold by 2040.  The US, the UK and the European Union have all developed strategies, meanwhile, to reduce their dependence on Chinese supplies.   As Chinese companies have increased their overseas mining operations, allegations of problems caused by these projects have steadily risen.  The Business and Human Rights Resource Centre, an NGO, says such troubles are ""not unique to Chinese mining"" but last year it published a report listing 102 allegations made against Chinese companies involved in extracting critical minerals, ranging from violations of the rights of local communities to damage to ecosystems and unsafe working conditions.   These allegations dated from 2021 and 2022. The BBC has counted more than 40 further allegations that were made in 2023, and reported by NGOs or in the media.   People in two countries, on opposite sides of the world, also told us their stories.   On the outskirts of Lubumbashi in the far south of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Christophe Kabwita has been leading opposition to the Ruashi cobalt mine, owned by the Jinchuan Group since 2011.  He says the open-pit mine, situated 500m from his doorstep, blights people's lives by using explosives to blast away at the rock two or three times per week. Sirens wail when the blasting is about to start, as a signal for everyone to stop what they are doing and take cover.   ""Whatever the temperature, whether it's raining or a gale is blowing, we have to leave our homes and go to a shelter near the mine,"" he says.  This applies to everyone, including the sick and women who have just given birth, he adds, as nowhere else is safe.  In 2017 a teenage girl, Katty Kabazo, was reportedly killed by a flying rock on her way home from school, while other rocks are said to have punched holes into the walls and roofs of local houses.  A spokesperson from the Ruashi mine, Elisa Kalasa, acknowledged that ""one young kid was in that area - she was not supposed to be there and was affected by the flying rocks"".     She said that since then ""we have improved the technology, and now we have the sort of blasting where there are no flying rocks any more"".   However, the BBC spoke to a processing manager at the company, Patrick Tshisand, who appeared to give a different picture. He said: ""If we mine, we use explosives. Explosives can cause flying rocks, which can end up in the community because the community is too close to the mine... so we had several accidents like that.""     Ms Kalasa also said that between 2006 and 2012 the company compensated more than 300 families to relocate further away from the mine.  On Indonesia's remote Obi Island, a mine jointly owned by a Chinese company, Lygend Resources and Technology, and Indonesian mining giant Harita Group has rapidly swallowed up the forests around the village of Kawasi.    Jatam, a local mining watchdog, says that villagers have been under pressure to move and accept government compensation. Dozens of families have refused to relocate, saying what is on offer is below market value. As a result, some say they have been threatened with legal action for allegedly disrupting a project of national strategic importance.    Jatam says old-growth forests have been logged to make way for the mine and they've documented how the rivers and ocean have been filled with sediment, polluting what was once a pristine marine environment.     ""The water from the river is undrinkable now, it's so contaminated, and the sea, that is usually clear blue, turns red when it rains,"" Nur Hayati, a teacher who lives in Kawasi village, says.      Indonesian soldiers have been deployed to the island to protect the mine and when the BBC visited recently, there was a noticeable, increased military presence. Jatam claims soldiers are being used to intimidate, and even assault, people who speak out against the mine. Ms Nur says her community feels the army is there to ""protect the interests of the mine, not the welfare of their own people"".  The military's spokesperson in Jakarta said allegations of intimidation ""cannot be proven"" and that while the soldiers were there to ""protect the mine"" they were not there to ""directly interact with locals"".   In a statement, he claimed the relocation of villagers to make way for the mine had been overseen by the police in a ""peaceful and smooth manner"".   Ms Nur was among a group of villagers who travelled to the Indonesian capital, Jakarta, in June 2018, to protest against the impact of the mine. But a local government representative, Samsu Abubakar, told the BBC no complaints had been received from the public about environmental damage.     He also shared an official report that concluded Harita Group had been ""compliant with environmental management and monitoring obligations"".     Harita itself told us that it ""adheres strictly to ethical business practices and local laws"" and it is ""continuously working to address and mitigate any negative impacts"".  It claimed it had not caused widespread deforestation, it monitored the local source of drinking water, and independent tests have confirmed the water met government quality standards. It added that it had not carried out forced evictions or unfair land transactions and had not intimidated anyone.     A year ago, the Chinese mining trade body, known as CCCMC, started setting up a grievance mechanism, intended to resolve complaints made against Chinese-owned mining projects. The companies themselves ""lack the ability - both cultural and linguistic"" to interact with local communities or civil society organisations, says a spokesperson, Lelia Li.   However, the mechanism still isn't fully operating.  Meanwhile, China's involvement in foreign mining operations seems certain to increase. It's not just a ""geopolitical play"" to control a key market, says Aditya Lolla, the Asia programme director at Ember, a UK-based environmental think tank, it also makes sense from a business perspective.   ""Acquisitions are being made by Chinese companies because, for them, it's all about profits,"" he says.  As a result, Chinese workers will continue to be sent to mining projects around the world and for them, these projects mostly present a chance to earn good money.  People such as Wang Gang, who has worked for 10 years in Chinese-owned cobalt mines in DR Congo. The 48-year-old lives in company accommodation and eats in the staff canteen, working 10-hour days, seven days a week, with four days' leave per month.   He accepts the separation from his family in Hubei province, because he earns more than he could at home. He also enjoys the clear skies and tall forests of DR Congo.   He communicates with local mine workers in a mixture of French, Swahili, and English, but says: ""We rarely chat, except for work-related matters.""   Even Ai Qing, who speaks the language of her host country fluently, has little interaction with Argentines outside work. She's started seeing a fellow Chinese worker, and they mostly hang out with other people like themselves - being thousands of miles from home pulls everyone closer.   A highlight for her is visiting the salt flats high up in the Andes where the lithium is mined and life is ""chill"".    ""The altitude sickness always gets me - I can't fall asleep and I can't eat,"" she says. ""But I really do enjoy going up there because things are much simpler, and there are no office politics.""   Ai Qing and Wang Gang are pseudonyms  Additional reporting by Emery Makumeno, Byobe Malenga, Lucien Kahozy"
geopolitical tensions,How Chinese firms are using Mexico as a backdoor to the US,2024-09-15,2024-04-21,By Will Grant,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68825118,"The reclining armchairs and plush leather sofas coming off the production line at Man Wah Furniture's factory in Monterrey are 100% ""Made in Mexico"".  They're destined for large retailers in the US, like Costco and Walmart. But the company is from China, its Mexican manufacturing plant built with Chinese capital. The triangular relationship between the US, China and Mexico is behind the buzzword in Mexican business: nearshoring. Man Wah is one of scores of Chinese companies to relocate to industrial parks in northern Mexico in recent years, to bring production closer to the US market. As well as saving on shipping, their final product is considered completely Mexican - meaning Chinese firms can avoid the US tariffs and sanctions imposed on Chinese goods amid the continuing trade war between the two countries. As the company's general manager, Yu Ken Wei, shows me around its vast site, he says the move to Mexico has made economic and logistical sense. ""We hope to triple or even quadruple production here,"" he says in perfect Spanish. ""The intention here in Mexico is to bring production up to the level of our operation in Vietnam."" The firm only arrived in the city of Monterrey in 2022, but already employs 450 people in Mexico. Yu Ken Wei says they hope to grow to more than 1,200 employees, operating several new lines at the plant in the coming years. ""People here in Mexico are very hardworking and fast learners,"" says Mr Yu. ""We've got good operators, and their productivity is high. So, on the labour side, I think Mexico is strategically very good too."" Certainly, nearshoring is considered to be providing an important shot in the arm to the Mexican economy - by June of last year, Mexico's total exports had risen 5.8% from a year earlier to $52.9bn (£42.4bn). The trend is showing few signs of slowing down. In just two months of this year, there were announcements of capital investment in Mexico of almost half of the annual total back in 2020. The Man Wah sofa factory is located inside Hofusan, a Chinese-Mexican industrial park. Demand for its plots is sky high: every available space has been sold. In fact, the Industrial Parks Association of Mexico say every site due to be built in the country by 2027 has already been bought up. Little wonder many Mexican economists say China's interest in the country is no passing fad. ""The structural reasons that are bringing capital to Mexico are here to stay,"" says Juan Carlos Baker Pineda, Mexico's former vice-minister for external trade. ""I have no indication that the trade war between China and the US is going to diminish any time soon."" Mr Baker Pineda was part of Mexico's negotiating team for the new North American free trade agreement, USMCA. ""While the Chinese origin of the capital coming into Mexico may be uncomfortable for the policies of some countries,"" he says, ""according to international trade legislation, those products are, to all intents and purposes, Mexican"". That has given Mexico an obvious strategic foothold between the two superpowers: Mexico recently replaced China as the US's main trading partner, a significant and symbolic change. Mexico's increased trade with the US has also come about in part through a second key aspect of nearshoring in the country: US firms setting up Mexican facilities too, sometimes after relocating production from factories in Asia. Perhaps the standout announcement came from Elon Musk last year, when he unveiled plans for a new Tesla Gigafactory outside Monterrey. However, the electric car company is yet to break ground on the $10bn plant. And, while Tesla is apparently still committed to the project, it has slowed its plans amid concerns over the global economy, and recent job cuts at the carmaker. But regarding Chinese investment, some urge caution over Mexico being drawn into the wider geopolitical struggle between the US and China. ""The old rich guy in town, the US, is having problems with the new rich guy in town, China,"" says Enrique Dussel of the Centre for China-Mexico Studies at the National Autonomous University in Mexico. ""And Mexico - under previous administrations, and in this one - doesn't have a strategy vis-à-vis this new triangular relationship."" With elections looming on both sides of the US-Mexico border, there may be new political considerations ahead. But whether it's Donald Trump or Joe Biden in the White House over the next four years, few expect any improvement in US-China relations. Mr Dussel thinks nearshoring is better defined by what he calls ""security-shoring"", saying Washington has placed national security concerns above all other factors in its relationship with China. Mexico, he argues, must be wary of being caught in the middle. Amid this tension, Mr Dussel says: ""Mexico is putting up a big sign to China saying: 'Welcome to Mexico!'. You don't need a PhD to know that this isn't going to end well for bilateral relations between the US and Mexico in the medium term,"" he adds. Others are more optimistic. ""In my mind, the question is not if this trend will continue, but rather how much of this trend can we take advantage of,"" says former Mexican trade official, Juan Carlos Baker Pineda. ""I'm sure people are having these same discussions in Colombia, in Vietnam, in Costa Rica. So, we need to make sure in Mexico that those conditions that are aligned by themselves go hand-in-hand with corporate and government decisions to sustain that trend in the long term."" Back in Monterrey, the talented Mexican seamstresses at Man Wah Furniture put the finishing touches to another sofa before it's shipped north. When an American family buys it at a Walmart store near them, they may have little idea of the complex geopolitics underpinning its production. But whether nearshoring is a clever back door to the US, or part of a costly war between superpowers, it's currently Mexico's key advantage in these hostile times of global trade."
geopolitical tensions,Biden calls for tripling tariffs on Chinese metals,2024-09-15,2024-04-17,By Jonathan Josephs,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68838063,"US President Joe Biden has called for a tripling of tariffs on some steel and aluminium from China. It is the latest protectionist policy to be embraced by Mr Biden as he campaigns for re-election against Donald Trump, who was known for his tough trade stance against China. The White House said the proposal was aimed at protecting US jobs against ""unfair"" competition.  China has previously denied claims of dumping steel and aluminium overseas. Dumping is selling excess product in another country for a very cheap price and can often decimate the local industry's own market of that product. Speaking to members of the United Steelworkers union in Pennsylvania on Wednesday, the president said the Chinese prices were ""unfairly low"" due to the government subsidising companies ""who don't need to worry about making a profit"".  ""They're cheating,"" Mr Biden said. ""And we've seen the damage here in America."" He said tens of thousands of steelworker jobs had been lost in the early 2000s because of Chinese imports.  ""We're not going to let that happen again,"" he said. The Chinese embassy in the US said it ""firmly opposes"" the measures proposed by Mr Biden. ""Many trading partners of the United States, including China, are strongly dissatisfied with the United States' frequent use of national security, non-market behaviour, overcapacity and other reasons to impose restrictions and politicise trade issues,"" embassy spokesman Liu Pengyu said in a statement to the BBC.  Mr Pengyu added he hopes the US will work with China ""to stop actions that violate international economic and trade rules"" and cancel the tariffs. The International Monetary Fund warned on Tuesday that this kind of geopolitical tension risked damaging global economic growth and pushing inflation in the wrong direction. The White House has denied that the tariffs - which would lift a key border tax rate from an average of 7.5% to 25% on a tiny fraction of imports - would raise prices in the US. Mr Biden discussed the proposal - and other pro-manufacturing efforts - at an election rally in Pittsburgh, a key base for the steel industry in the US.  He and Mr Trump are competing for support from working class voters, who could be a deciding voting bloc in November's election.  As well as the tariffs, the White House said it would launch an investigation into unfair trade practices in the Chinese shipbuilding and logistics sectors, acting on a request from the US Steelworkers union and others.  The White House said it was also pushing for action against Chinese firms looking to avoid US border taxes by shipping through Mexico.  Mr Biden has also spoken out against a proposed takeover of US Steel by Japan's Nippon Steel, saying he believed the business should remain US-owned.  The higher tariffs would affect metals imports being reviewed under a so-called 301 investigation, which focuses on policies affecting US commerce.  Many steel and aluminium imports from China already face border taxes, including a 25% duty on certain steel products, which the US put in place under former president Donald Trump using national security justifications. Those were ruled to be in breach of global trade rules by the World Trade Organization and were later dialled back for many countries.  Those tariffs marked a key turn in Washington's approach to trade, which had long been dominated by free-market, pro-trade consensus. Mr Trump, who called himself ""tariff man"", has pledged to be even more aggressive on trade should he be re-elected.  He has proposed a 10% border tax on all imports, which would jump to more than 60% for products from China. "
geopolitical tensions,Oil prices dip after Iran attack on Israel,2024-09-15,2024-04-15,"By Michael Race, Peter Hoskins & Nick Edser",https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68812949,"Oil prices fell on Monday after Iran's reprisal attack on Israel over the weekend. Brent crude - a key benchmark for oil prices internationally - was lower but still trading close to $90 a barrel. Prices had already risen in expectation of action by Iran, with Brent crude nearing a six-month high last week. Analysts said the markets would be looking to see how the conflict could affect global supply chains. Oil price fluctuations can cause ripple effects across the world due to countries being heavily reliant on the commodity, which is used to produce fuels such as petrol and diesel. Fuel and energy prices have been a major driver behind the higher cost of living worldwide in the past couple of years. When Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, oil prices soared to $120 a barrel over supply fears as western nations imposed sanctions on Russia, one of the world's major oil exporters. The jump led to not only higher prices at the pumps, but also countless other goods as businesses adjusted their prices to cover higher costs. Analysts said Israel's reaction to the attack would be key for global markets in the days and weeks ahead. Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant has said the confrontation with Iran is ""not over yet"".  His comments came after Iran launched drones and missiles towards Israel at the weekend after vowing retaliation for an attack on its consulate in the Syrian capital Damascus on 1 April. Israel has not said it carried out the consulate strike, but is widely believed to have been behind it. At the end of last week, the price of Brent crude touched $92.18 a barrel, the highest since October, but on Monday it fell back to around $89.50. The price of gold - often seen as a safe investment at times of uncertainty - also dropped. After hitting a record high of $2,431.29 an ounce on Friday, gold fell back to $2,332.97 on Monday. Energy analyst Vandana Hari said the fall in the price of oil meant ""clearly, the oil market does not see the need to factor in any additional supply threat at this point"". But Peter McGuire from trading platform XM.com said he expected the energy market to be volatile and predicted that oil prices would surge if Israel responded strongly to Iran's move. However, April LaRusse, head of investment at Insight Investment, said it was likely that markets would ""trade sideways until we have more information"". ""Unfortunately this situation in the Middle East has been going on for some time and the longer you have a bit of geo-political tension going on the more markets wait to see and there isn't sort of a panic reaction as the first move,"" she told the BBC's Today programme. Share markets in the Asia-Pacific region slipped on Monday as investors weighed the impact of the attack. The UK's FTSE 100 share index also fell marginally. Russ Mould, investment director at investment firm AJ Bell, said the markets had ""started the week with relative calm"". However, he said there was a ""continuing nervousness among investors"".  ""The situation remains fraught and, beyond the geopolitical and humanitarian implications, a more widespread conflict in the Middle East could see energy prices surge and unpick central banks' careful efforts to bring down inflation,"" he added. Iran is the seventh largest oil producer in the world, according to the US Energy Information Administration, and the third-largest member of the Opec oil producers' cartel. Analysts say that a key issue for the oil price going forward is whether shipping through the Strait of Hormuz will be affected. The Strait - which is between Oman and Iran - is a crucial shipping route, as about 20% of the world's total oil supply passes through it. Opec members Saudi Arabia, Iran, the UAE, Kuwait and Iraq send most of the oil they export through the Strait. On Saturday, Iran seized a commercial ship with links to Israel as it passed through the Strait of Hormuz."
geopolitical tensions,Climate change: Storm clouds gather after COP26,2024-09-15,2021-12-29,By Matt McGrath,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-59744522,"Is the progress that was made at the COP26 Glasgow climate summit already in jeopardy because of challenges in the year ahead? 2021 was a momentous year for climate change.  As well as a host of extreme, destructive events influenced by rising temperatures, the past 12 months have seen unprecedented political engagement on the issue, culminating in the COP26 summit in Glasgow in November. Progress was undoubtedly made and the overall thrust of the meeting was towards more rapid action on a whole host of measures to curb emissions. But there are now growing concerns that this momentum may dissipate over the coming months.  The most grievous blow comes from the US. The potential failure of President Biden to get his Build Back Better act through Congress would significantly impact the ability of the US to meet the tough climate targets that the White House has committed to.   It would also hugely affect the relatively unified approach to climate change on display among world leaders at COP26. ""Everything that Biden pledged, led to this relatively good atmosphere and a sense of momentum in Glasgow,"" said Dr Joanna Depledge, a fellow at the Cambridge Centre for Environment, Energy and Natural Resource Governance.  ""But these were just promises, he needs to get the bill through Congress. And it's now looking increasingly dicey. He can do some things with executive orders, but that certainly isn't the kind of sustained institutional climate legislation change that we're really looking for.""  ""I think the situation to us, is critical."" The despair among many in the US over the possible failure of President Biden's bill will also have knock-on effects throughout the world. This will certainly be the case in China, a country smarting from the perception that it flexed its political muscle in Glasgow to get its way. Biden's political difficulties with the bill are seen as more evidence that the ""West is declining"". ""I am worried 2022 will see a fuller display of geopolitical tension dominating the climate agenda,"" said Li Shuo, from Greenpeace East Asia.  He is also concerned that the mooted introduction of carbon taxes on imported goods into Europe could elevate a sense of unfairness and frustration in Beijing. ""The Chinese side will see how they are treated vis-a-vis others and make its judgment on whether the game is fair, and most importantly, if it is about the environment at all, or just geopolitics and trade,"" he told BBC News. Overall, I am looking at a more turbulent year ahead. The years before the Paris agreement were an example of geopolitics helping the climate agenda forward. What lies ahead may be the opposite."" This pessimistic outlook is echoed by the fact that next year's COP is being held in Egypt, and the one after that in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).  ""Neither of these countries could be described as climate leaders,"" said Prof J Timmons Roberts from Brown University in Rhode Island, US. The good side is that COP27 will be in a developing country, and some issues like loss and damage [who pays for the impact of climate change in the worst affected countries, and how it is paid] may get more traction, but on the issue of emissions reductions, it's not clear that they're going to be leaders."" Another key concern heading into 2022 is that some countries may simply ignore aspects of the Glasgow climate pact that they don't like.  One key measure in the deal was the request for all countries to ""revisit and strengthen"" their national climate pledges by the time delegates gather in Egypt late in 2022.  Despite agreeing to this, a number of countries now say they simply won't update their plans, among them Australia and New Zealand. New Zealand's climate minister James Shaw told national media that this provision really only applied to large emitters like India, China, Russia and Brazil which hadn't significantly strengthened their plans in time for Glasgow. However, there are also some positive developments in the offing that could make a significant difference to the general mood around climate change. During COP26, the UK, EU, US, Germany and France agreed to pay $8.5bn to help South Africa abandon coal. Now, those close to the negotiations say that two new deals to help India and Indonesia move away from the most carbon-intensive energy source are in the pipeline. These will be expensive, running into the tens of billions, but if they happen, they would represent a massive step away from fossil fuels. These types of arrangements, and the commitment to doubling adaptation finance made by richer countries will be key to progress in 2022, say officials.  Another positive is that the UK's presidency continues right up to next November when Egypt takes over.  COP26 President Alok Sharma has made it clear that he intends to push forward over the coming months in efforts to ensure that the agreements secured in Glasgow on deforestation, coal, finance and cars will start to be implemented.  Mr Sharma's background as an auditor will come in handy in making sure there's no slippage over the integrity of the commitments made.  ""The UK, as hosts of COP26, spent the last two years working tirelessly with countries to build trust, which ultimately allowed us to deliver the Glasgow climate pact,"" he told BBC News. ""We will continue in the same vein through 2022 to make sure countries keep their promises, re-visit their emissions reductions targets, get finance flowing, and deliver on the many commitments made during the two weeks of the summit."" Another positive is the fact that Germany will chair the G7 group of countries. The co-leader of the German Green party is now the country's foreign minister, so climate will remain high on the international diplomatic agenda.  Infrastructure investment in the wake of the Covid pandemic, especially in middle income countries, also offers a great chance to lock in significant action to limit emissions.  The final agreement on the rules for carbon markets, agreed in Glasgow, has coincided with a record rise in the price of carbon permits in Europe and the UK.  While this has downsides, a sustained high carbon price could significantly speed up a transition to cleaner sources of energy. But, as ever, global events could see all these potential positives quickly pale.  Disputes between Russia and Ukraine, China's disengagement and a drubbing for the Democrats in mid-term elections in the US could all derail or at least delay any further progress on climate change.  And stalling or taking small steps right now would be a disaster for efforts to keep the rise in global temperatures under 1.5C this century. ""Right now, incremental steps are a death sentence,"" said Prof Roberts.  However, the climate negotiations process is highly unpredictable - and even when things appear to be at their darkest, countries are often able to make sufficient compromises to keep things moving forward.  Certainly the COP26 president says he's determined to push ahead and that the UK can be a role model for others. ""Leaving COP26 with the Glasgow climate pact was a historic moment demonstrating the world's shared commitment to taking real climate action,"" said Alok Sharma. ""As we look ahead, the most pressing issue is the timescale on when this action takes place and the reality is that the world needs to act at a much faster pace."" ""I believe we will reach a net zero world, and the UK is leading the way through our own actions such as rapidly expanding our renewables sector and working to eliminate the use of coal from our electricity generation in 2024, the question is whether that will be fast enough to avoid the worst effects of climate change.""

geopolitical tensions,Sudan fighting: Why it matters to countries worldwide,2024-09-15,2023-04-20,By Andrew Harding,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-65338247,"If you want to know why Sudan matters to so many other countries, just take a look at a map. There's a reason why the fighting that has erupted there over the past week is ringing so many international alarm bells. Sudan is not only huge - the third largest country in Africa - it also stretches across an unstable and geopolitically vital region.  Whatever happens militarily or politically in the capital, Khartoum, ripples across some of the most fragile parts of the continent. The country straddles the Nile River, making the nation's fate of almost existential importance; downstream, to water-hungry Egypt, and upstream, to land-locked Ethiopia with its ambitious hydro-electric plans that now affect the river's flow. Sudan borders seven countries in all, each with security challenges that are intertwined with the politics of Khartoum.  Trouble in Sudan's western Darfur region almost inevitably spills over into neighbouring Chad, and vice versa. Weapons and fighters from coup-prone Chad, and from the war-torn Central African Republic, often flow freely across the region's porous borders. Much the same has proved true with Libya, to the north-west. Sudan borders the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia - only recently emerging from a gruelling conflict that involved another unpredictable neighbour, the isolated and highly militarised autocracy of Eritrea. There is also tension on other parts of Ethiopia and Sudan's shared - and in places, contested - border.                                                                                                                                                  To the south, Sudan faces a relatively new nation, South Sudan, which formally broke away from its northern neighbour in 2011 after one of Africa's longest and bloodiest civil wars. That border, too, remains unstable.  South Sudan quickly spiralled into the sort of broad scale civil war that some fear could now be Sudan's fate too. Upon independence, South Sudan took with it most of the region's precious oil fields, leaving Sudan far poorer, and contributing, indirectly, to the current crisis in Khartoum, as rival military groups now struggle for control of shrinking economic resources, like gold and agriculture. As part of that struggle, Sudan's generals - the military have always been big, allegedly corrupt players in the local economy - have gone in search of foreign partners. For agriculture, that has meant inviting Gulf states to invest in the huge, and relatively underused potential of the rich soil that borders the Nile River. When it comes to gold, far murkier deals appear to have been done with Russia's notorious Wagner group, which is accused of smuggling gold out of Sudan. The US Treasury has accused Wagner's head, Yevgeniy Prigozhin, of ""exploiting Sudan's natural resources for personal gain and spreading malign influence"" online through his ""troll farm"".  Russia's interests in the country, and region, go much further. Eastern Sudan's stark coastline looks out onto the Red Sea.  The Kremlin has, for years, been seeking to establish a military base in Port Sudan, giving its warships access to - and influence over - one of the world's busiest and most contested sea lanes. Moscow has come close to finalising a deal about the base with Sudan's military government - which seized power in 2021 in a coup. Not surprisingly, a vast range of governments are now seeking to influence events on the ground in Sudan.  For now, the focus appears to be on ending the battle between the army and the RSF paramilitary group before it spreads further, and threatens to evolve from a relatively straightforward power struggle into a more complex civil war.  Beyond that, some foreign governments are anxious to help guide Sudan towards the democracy that many had hoped might follow the overthrow, back in 2019, of the country's brutal ruler, Omar al-Bashir.  But other states may prefer to back another strongman, and to thwart the will of the Sudanese people, who have waited decades for one of Africa's struggling giants to fulfil its potential."
geopolitical tensions,How the Brittney Griner prisoner swap was done,2024-09-15,2022-12-08,By Barbara Plett Usher,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-63908670,"This is a significant moment for President Joe Biden, who's been under public pressure to bring Brittney Griner home, and for Griner's wife Cherelle, who's been campaigning tirelessly to make it happen.  The relief and joy was evident as they stood next to each other at the White House.  ""She is safe. She is on a plane. She is on her way home,"" Biden declared in an address to the nation, calling her ordeal ""months of hell"".  A beaming Cherelle told journalists she was ""overwhelmed with emotion"" and was ""going to smile right now"".  It took more than nine months to get to this point, but despite the celebrations the administration failed to win freedom for another detained US citizen - Paul Whelan.   Griner was arrested at a Moscow airport in February on drugs charges when vape cartridges containing a small quantity of cannabis oil were found in her luggage - just days before Russia invaded Ukraine. She pleaded guilty but said it was an honest mistake.  The Biden administration declared she'd been wrongfully detained and swung into action. It has made the release of US hostages a priority and created a special envoy for this purpose. But Griner's case was shadowed by added layers of complexity and pressure - not least that negotiations took place against the backdrop of a war in which the US is arming Ukraine.  Still, the administration in April was able to win the release of an American marine imprisoned in Russia, Trevor Reed. It exchanged him for a Russian pilot sentenced to cocaine trafficking charges in the US, demonstrating that the two countries could keep open a channel separate from their geopolitical tensions. This, together with the publicity surrounding Griner's detention, galvanised the families of other detainees who banded together to lobby for more action from the White House.  In July, Griner sent a handwritten letter to Biden saying she was afraid she'd be detained indefinitely and pleading with him not to forget her.  Just days later, Secretary of State Antony Blinken publicly expressed frustration that Russian counterparts were refusing to engage with what he called a ""substantial offer"". That was a highly unusual move in the discreet world of hostage diplomacy and a window into what Biden called ""painstaking negotiations"".  It became clear the Russians wanted a prisoner swap for Viktor Bout - a notorious arms dealer who was serving a 25 year sentence in US prison. In Russia he is referred to simply as a businessman, known to have carried out risky aviation trips to dangerous places. It's not clear whether he had connections to Russian intelligence but both Russian and US experts agree that he must have known quite a lot, which is probably why the Kremlin wanted him back.  It was a big ask and the administration negotiated hard to include Whelan - a corporate security executive who's been jailed for nearly four years. He has been convicted of espionage and is serving a 16-year prison sentence.  Despite Blinken's public statement in July, US officials said the talks were stonewalled for months; Griner received a harsh nine year prison sentence - lost an appeal - and last month was sent to a remote penal colony.    Things looked dark for the basketball player - until today.  In recent weeks both Russian and US officials had expressed cautious optimism but the announcement of a prisoner swap was delivered without warning.  A US official said the agreement came together in the past 48 hours; the sticking point appears to have been the two-for-one deal. The Russians made clear Griner was the only option.  ""This was not a choice of which American to bring home,"" US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said. ""The choice was one or none.""  Biden made the ""very painful"" decision to go ahead and Griner and Bout are reported to have passed each other on the tarmac at the Abu Dhabi airport where the exchange took place.  Shortly afterwards the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Saudi Arabia released a statement saying their joint mediation efforts had helped secure Griner's release.  Biden thanked the UAE for providing a location for the swap but the White House played down the notion of a formal mediation role. The White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the US was grateful to Saudi Arabia for raising the issue with Moscow but the deal was negotiated by the US and Russia.   US officials - from the president down- repeatedly said they regretted that Whelan was not included in the deal and vowed to continue efforts to secure his release.  The difficulties had to do with the ""sham espionage"" charges made against him, according to a US official. Apparently it is a bigger deal for the Russians to trade a spy than a sports star.  It was a reminder that there are other Americans who've been detained for much longer than 9 months who don't have celebrity status to help propel their case.  It was also a reminder that there are limits to what the US can achieve and that it had to pay a high price.  ""The other side always gets a strong vote,"" US Hostage envoy Roger Carstens recently said. In this case the US traded a convicted arms dealer known as the ""merchant of death"" for a sports star caught with less than a gram of cannabis oil.  That this prisoner swap is the second this year however indicates that the Russians and Americans do keep up shadowy contacts even though official relations are frozen. "
geopolitical tensions,Tensions highlight the importance of global trade,2024-09-15,2019-10-23,By Tim Bowler,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50041839,"Global trade used to be a slightly worthy topic - loved by economists and confined to the financial pages of newspapers. But recent high profile trade rows have changed all that, underlining its value and importance to us all. Looking at the news headlines, it is easy to think that trade flows are going into reverse. The continuing dispute between the US and China has seen Washington imposing tariffs on more than $360bn (£287m) of Chinese goods, while Beijing has retaliated with tariffs on more than $110bn of US products. Elsewhere, Japan and South Korea's trade dispute is threatening the production of smartphones, computers and other electronics, while the European Union and the UK face potential disruption from a disorderly Brexit. Yet step back from the headlines, and take the longer view, and things look different. The world traded more than $25tn in goods and services in 2018 - and that's more than 50 times the value of the products directly affected by the US and Chinese tariffs.  The growth in global trade may have slowed to 3.0% this year - the lowest since the 2009 recession - according to International Monetary Fund, but the trend is still upward  The more a country trades with its neighbours, the better the state of its economy; and nations whose domestic economies are growing significantly also tend to have higher rates of growth in trade as a share of their output, argue economists. ""Liberal trade policies that allow the unrestricted flow of goods and services sharpen competition, motivate innovation and breed success,"" says the World Trade Organization (WTO).   And trade has existed as long as we humans have formed civilised societies. In the 3rd millennium BC, the Sumerian city states in Mesopotamia (now Iraq) traded with the Harappan civilization of the Indus Valley (present-day Pakistan, parts of India and Afghanistan). By the 2nd millennium BC, Bronze Age Greece, Egypt, Babylon and the Hittite empire (now Turkey) regularly traded with each other - and with distant Afghanistan, where the semi-precious stone, lapis lazuli, was highly prized for its intense blue colour and used in jewellery.  It was a trade that came to a spectacular end when their interconnected civilisations came crashing down around 1150BC - perhaps the first example we know of a ""global"" economic collapse. Today the sheer variety of global trade can be astounding. For example, take cut flower exports from countries like Peru and Kenya. These have soared thanks to the growth of air travel, and the trade is now worth more than $16bn a year - that's a lot of bouquets. Or take the humble bicycle; in the UK 50 years ago most were produced in one city - Nottingham. Today the industry is worth $45bn worldwide, and relies on an integrated global supply chain with ""rims from Bulgaria, titanium from China, metal from Taiwan, hub gears from America"",  says Will Butler-Adams of the UK's Brompton Bikes firm. But it is the 20th Century's semiconductor chip which has gone further than any other single item of technology in deepening many of our connections. It's estimated the average western customer now uses services from 40 satellites orbiting the globe every day - all thanks to computer chips.  While silicon - the natural element at the heart of this $500bn industry - is found in 90% of the Earth's crust, much of it comes from just one small town in North Carolina called Spruce Pine. A particularly pure source of quartz, the mineral from which silicon is extracted, is mined there. ""It does boggle the mind a bit,"" says mine manager Rolf Pippert, ""to consider that inside nearly every cell phone, and computer chip, you'll find quartz from Spruce Pine.""  In modern history, there have been two long waves of globalization. The first started after the Napoleonic wars in 1815 and ended with World War One. The second started after 1945 and is still continuing; the volume of goods exported today is more than 40 times greater than it was in 1913, with about 25% of total global production sold abroad. Now we are seeing another radical shift.  While it took centuries for the world's economies to shift from agriculture to manufacturing, the rise of the services sector has occurred much more quickly over the past 20 years, and now accounts for 68% of total global GDP. Yet here, barriers to trading services internationally still remain, putting a break on economic growth. ""What good is it manufacturing world-class goods if you don't have sufficient access to business services like banking, accountancy and insurance to make global operations viable?"" argues Simon MacAdam, global economist at Capital Economics.  More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade: When it comes to exporting, small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) are often under-represented. Bigger firms have more capacity to absorb the expense of pioneering in new overseas markets, and smaller firms can often find it hard to get the relevant information they need in a timely fashion. But recent changes in the global trading landscape, such as the rise of global value chains and the digital transformation, are offering new opportunities for SMEs to integrate into the global economy.  Greater flexibility and capacity to customise and differentiate products can give SMEs a competitive advantage in global markets, as they can respond rapidly to changing market conditions and increasingly shorter product life cycles. So what next? The opening decades of the 21st Century have been labelled as heralding an ""Asian century"". While critics might quote those oft-disputed words of Zhou Enlai - ""it is too soon to say"" - what is certainly true is that established trading patterns have radically changed. We've seen the rise of new groupings like Brics (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa), and new trade deals like the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP): agreed between Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, and Vietnam, the CPTPP is now the world's third-largest free trade area. The only two still bigger are the North American Free Trade Agreement between the US, Canada and Mexico; and the European Union. Advocates of free trade say that while globalisation is causing political strains in some countries, as employment patterns shift, retreating into simple protectionism will simply exacerbate rather than resolve problems. And on that note, in her summary earlier this month, IMF chief economist Gita Gopinath pointedly referred to the global importance of calming the current trade disputes. ""To rejuvenate growth, policymakers must undo the trade barriers put in place with durable agreements, rein in geopolitical tensions and reduce domestic policy uncertainty.""   In the end, it all comes down to trade. You can watch the latest Made on Earth film at these times this weekend on BBC World TV:  Sat 26 Oct at 01:30 and 08:30 GMT; Sun 27 at 14:30 and 21:30 GMT.

geopolitical tensions,Iranian tanker 'attacked' off Saudi coast,2024-09-15,2019-10-11,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-50011218,"An Iranian-owned oil tanker has been attacked in the Red Sea off the coast of Saudi Arabia, Iran's foreign ministry says. The ministry said the tanker Sabiti had been hit twice, causing some damage. Earlier Iran's national oil company (NIOC) said two explosions on the vessel had been caused ""likely by missiles"". But it dismissed earlier reports quoting it as saying the missiles were likely to have come from Saudi Arabia. In recent months ""other sabotage acts"" had been carried out against Iranian tankers in the Red Sea and these were being investigated, foreign ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi said. The incident took place at 04:50 (01:50 GMT) about 95km (60 miles) from the Saudi city of Jeddah, Iran's Mehr news agency said. Two of the vessel's tanks were struck, it added, causing damage measuring between 0.5m and 1.5m. There were no reports of injuries. The Sabiti is now sailing towards the Gulf, Mehr said. The reports have so far only come from Iranian sources. There has been no comment from Saudi officials. Iranian state TV earlier identified the vessel as the Sinopa, but the NIOC later said it was the Sabiti. Pictures allegedly taken on Friday aboard the Sabiti have been published by Iranian state TV, showing no visible signs of damage. Paul Adams, BBC Diplomatic Correspondent This story is as clear as mud. It seemed to change. Two different ships have been named - the Sinopa and the Sabiti. We had reports of missiles striking the tanker and then an accusation briefly levelled against Saudi Arabia for committing what was described as an ""act of terrorism"". That claim seems to have been dropped quite quickly.  And crucially there is no independent evidence at all that the vessel was struck. Pictures were released later in the morning showing nothing untoward. And most crucially both tankers are currently steaming at full speed in their different directions so there is no evidence that either vessel has been impaired in any way.  Publicly available ship tracking records show both ships are currently in the Red Sea. The Sinopa turned its transmitter on earlier this week for the first time in more than 50 days. The Sabiti, meanwhile, turned its tracker on early Friday after nearly 60 days of no transmissions. Under international regulations, all vessels above a certain tonnage must be fitted with the trackers, known as automatic identification systems (AIS). But ships are not required to have their AIS turned on all the time. A source at maritime analytics firm Windward told the BBC it was common for Iranian tankers to turn off AIS to avoid detection - often to evade international sanctions or harassment from Saudi Arabia.  Because of safety regulations, vessels must have their AIS switched on when they are close to the Suez Canal. The Windward source said Sabiti was behaving unusually because, when going through the canal, it only switches on its AIS when rules require - but in this instance, the AIS had been turned on hundreds of miles from the Suez after being ""dark"" for two months. Michelle Bockmann, an analyst at shipping newspaper Lloyds List, told the BBC that the tanker - whichever one it was - was ""probably"" carrying oil to Syria. ""That really is, along with China, the only market there is for Iranian crude now since the US tightened sanctions in May,"" said Ms Bockmann. ""We're seeing geopolitics playing out within the global shipping and tanker markets, and this is just an extension of the instability that we're seeing in the region."" The latest incident came amid heightened tension between Iran and Saudi Arabia in recent months. Last month, 18 drones and seven cruise missiles hit a major oil field and processing facility in Saudi Arabia, which blamed Iran for the attack. And US officials said Iran was responsible for attacks on two oil tankers in the Gulf in June and July, as well as attacks on another four tankers in May. Iran denied involvement in all the incidents. "
geopolitical tensions,Why Australia will work to build ties with Indonesia,2024-09-15,2022-08-05,By Phil Mercer,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-62078999,"""Saya cinta Australia!"" says Indonesian student Sari Puspita Dewi.  ""I love Australia! It is my dreamland to live and to study.""   The PhD scholar from Jakarta has an electric enthusiasm for Australia that belies the country's often-lukewarm economic relationship with her homeland Indonesia, its giant neighbour to the north. Culturally different, but geographically close, the two countries have collaborated on border security and counter-terrorism, and share a nervousness about the rise of China, but the commercial relationship has been underdone. Pre-Covid, the holiday island of Bali was awash with carefree Aussies, but much of the vast Indonesian archipelago, from Sumatra to Sulawesi, often remains unnoticed.   Indonesia, the world's largest Muslim nation with a population of 270 million people, doesn't even make it into the top ten of Australia's most lucrative trading partners. ""It's hard to think of two neighbouring countries, each with economies in excess of a trillion dollars, that trade so little with one another,"" says Leigh Howard, the head of Asialink Business at the University of Melbourne.   ""The extent to which international investors have made real commitments in Indonesia over the past decade - not just China and major partners such as Japan and Korea, but Europeans, Emiratis, Singaporeans, and even Canadians - strongly suggest Australia is not seeing opportunities that others do.""  Language and cultural barriers have hindered Australian engagement with Indonesia. There have been easier pickings elsewhere for entrepreneurs in Singapore, the Philippines and the Pacific.  ""More small (Australian) businesses go to Fiji than Indonesia. I think Indonesia has traditionally been a closed market,"" says Tim Harcourt, chief economist at the University of Technology Sydney. ""Generally Indonesia is a bit like the United States or Brazil - they think about the domestic market first rather than a place like, say, Singapore, that's very much open to trade and investment from the global economies. ""Indonesia was never this low labour cost place that China, Vietnam and Bangladesh were. Indonesia's all about being a large middle class [that's fuelling] a domestic economy."" But that could all be about to change if Jennifer Matthews has her way. She's the national president of the Australia-Indonesia Business Council and is evangelising on Indonesia's new openness in a travelling roadshow across Australia in partnership with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT). It has visited Darwin in the Northern Territory, which is closer to Jakarta (2,700km) than it is to Canberra (3,100km), and will soon head to Sydney to promote the digital economy. ""The time is right,"" she says of accelerating Australian trade with Indonesia to boost jobs in the post-pandemic recovery. ""There is definitely an opportunity to grow this relationship. We can see the transformational change that is taking place in Indonesia right on our doorstep."" In July 2020, the Indonesia-Australia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (IA-CEPA) came into force.  ""By some estimates, Indonesia will be the world's fifth largest economy by 2030, and IA-CEPA ensures that Australia is well-placed to deepen economic co-operation and share in Indonesia's growth,"" DFAT said. The pact aims to jettison tariffs while nurturing commerce. Anthony Albanese, the recently elected Labor prime minister, made a trip to Indonesia within a few weeks of winning the election on 21 May.   It was an unequivocal statement that the new management in Canberra coveted the relationship and wanted trade to bloom.   ""The road to Jokowi's (the popular name for Indonesian President Joko Widodo) heart will be business and investment,"" Prof Dewi Fortuna Anwar, from Jakarta's Research Centre for Politics, told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. ""The ball is in Australia's court,"" she added. The key lies with innovation and services. Agriculture, resources, energy, education, training and healthcare are all sectors with potential, along with expertise in renewable power technology. Tim Harcourt's advice is for Aussie firms to look beyond the sprawling Indonesian capital for fertile ground. ""In West Java, I met a lot of South Australian, defence and agricultural companies that have done quite well. Yogyakarta, the gaming and IT centre of central Java is another opportunity. So, think about the archipelago as a number of very different, distinct markets rather than just zooming in to Jakarta."" Other sectors have been quietly going about their business with Australia's giant neighbour to the north. ""Indonesia is by far our largest trading partner when it comes to exports of Australian wheat. It's a pretty good relationship at the moment,"" Brett Hosking, chair of GrainGrowers, an industry group, and a farmer in Victoria, told the BBC News website. ""We have to be sensitive to the cultural uniqueness of each country, so understanding that Indonesia is a largely Muslim country. If we make the extra effort to do so we build a much stronger relationship."" Australia's biggest trading partner by some considerable distance is China. Its appetite for resources, most notably iron ore, made Australia rich, but geopolitical tensions have surfaced in recent years. Trade has suffered, too, with restrictions imposed on various Australian exports. Brett Hosking's personal interaction with Indonesian flour millers and government officials has helped to ensure that ties remain on a sound footing. ""We've had a disagreement with China around barley not so long ago. That has had an impact on our market. But disagreements will come and go. I would say there is a maturity in our trading relationship with Indonesia,"" he says. Indonesians have a long history of migration to Australia. Increasingly, its super young population wants to savour the education and lifestyle offered by its multicultural southern neighbour. With a YouTube channel and a following on social media, PhD student Sari Puspita Dewi, who arrived at the University of New South Wales last December, is doing her bit to encourage her compatriots to join her. ""So many people get inspired to study in Australia. It is near to Indonesia. They don't feel too homesick,"" she says. ""I was so happy when I was selected [for a scholarship]. If I have a chance, I want to live here longer, but of course on behalf of my country and contribute to Indonesia.""  "
geopolitical tensions,Australia provokes China anger over scrapped deals,2024-09-15,2021-04-22,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-56840299,"Australia has scrapped agreements tied to China's Belt and Road initiative, prompting anger from Beijing and adding further strain to tense relations between the countries.  The federal government used new powers to rip up two deals made between the state of Victoria and China.  Canberra said it was backing away from the agreements to protect Australia's national interest.  The Chinese embassy in Australia branded the move ""provocative"". It said the action by Canberra was ""bound to bring further damage to bilateral relations, and will only end up hurting itself.""  ""It further shows that the Australian government has no sincerity in improving China-Australia relations,"" a spokesperson said in a statement.  It is the first time Canberra has used the powers to veto deals made by states, local governments or public universities with foreign countries. The laws allow the government to cancel agreements deemed to threaten Australia's national interest. In addition to the China deals, Foreign Minister Marise Payne also scrapped agreements with Iran and Syria. They were a memorandum of understanding sealed between Victoria's education department and Iran, signed in 2004, and a 1999 scientific cooperation agreement signed with Syria.  Senator Payne said the four agreements were ""inconsistent with Australia's foreign policy or adverse to our foreign relations"". Speaking to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, she defended the government's decision and said she did not expect China to retaliate.  ""I think Australia is acting in our national interest, we are very careful and very considered in that approach,"" she told the AM radio programme. The Victoria state's decision to sign up to China's Belt and Road initiative, with two agreements in 2018 and 2019, drew criticism from the federal government, as well as then-US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. The sweeping infrastructure project - which aims to expand global trade links - has funded trains, roads, and ports in many countries, but has left some saddled with debt.  Seen as a bold bid by President Xi Jinping for geopolitical influence the US has been particularly critical of China's so-called ""debt diplomacy"". The move to cut ties with the initiative comes against backdrop of deteriorating tensions between Canberra and Beijing.  China is Australia's largest trading partner and before the pandemic, its biggest source of overseas university students. Relations have worsened in recent years, leading to diplomatic and trade ructions. Trade ties have been particularly strained since Australia first called for a rigorous investigation into the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic in April. Canberra has taken other steps to curtail China's influence in the country, including putting a ban on telecoms giant Huawei from building Australia's 5G network and tightening foreign investment laws.  Still, the Australian government has denied its new veto power is aimed at China. Senator Payne said local governments and publicly funded universities had notified her of more than 1,000 foreign deals. "

geopolitical tensions,Trump strikes warmer tone with China,2024-09-15,2017-11-09,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-41924228,"US President Donald Trump has lavished praise on Chinese leader Xi Jinping, a marked contrast to his previous criticism of China on the flashpoint issues of North Korea and trade.  But he also urged Mr Xi to ""work very hard"" on persuading North Korea to denuclearise. On China's trade surplus, Mr Trump surprised many when he said he did ""not blame China"" for ""taking advantage"". China has said it will lower market entry barriers to some sectors. The US president was speaking in Beijing while on a state visit. He is in the Chinese capital as part of his five-nation tour of Asia. The two leaders held talks earlier on Thursday after a grand welcome for Mr Trump. China will further lower entry barriers in the banking, insurance, and finance sectors, and gradually reduce vehicle tariffs, the Chinese foreign ministry said.  Deals worth $250bn (£190bn) have also been announced, although it is unclear how much of that figure includes past deals or potential future deals. But Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told journalists the deals were ""pretty small"" in terms of tackling the trade imbalance. Discussion on how to deal with North Korea's threats to the region has dominated Mr Trump's agenda, and China is Pyongyang's main economic supporter.  Mr Trump said China could fix the problem of North Korea's nuclear programme ""easily and quickly"". He added: ""I am calling on [Mr Xi] to work very hard. I know one thing about your president. If he works on it hard, it'll get done."" Mr Xi, for his part, said both sides would ""continue to work towards"" fully implementing UN sanctions and ""enduring peace"" on the Korean peninsula. Mr Trump has previously been more critical and tweeted in July that Beijing was doing ""NOTHING for us with North Korea, just talk"". Just before his arrival in Beijing he urged China to sever ties with the North. Beijing has consistently said it is doing all it can. ""I don't blame China - after all, who can blame a country for taking advantage of another country for the benefit of its citizens... I give China great credit,"" said Mr Trump while addressing a room of business leaders. Instead, the US leader said previous US administrations were responsible for what he called ""a very unfair and one-sided"" trade relationship with China. Mr Trump has in the past accused China of stealing American jobs and threatened to label it a currency manipulator, though he has since rowed back on such rhetoric. Mr Xi on Thursday promised ""healthy"" and ""balanced"" economic and trade relations. The two leaders also said they would work together to tackle terrorism and drug trafficking. Mr Trump upheld the ""one China"" policy in his talks with Mr Xi, Xinhua state news agency reported. Since arriving in Beijing, Mr Trump has been fulsome in his praise for the Chinese leader, saying at one point: ""You are a very special man."" He has also enthusiastically thanked Mr Xi for his hospitality in several tweets. Mr Trump flew into Beijing on Wednesday and was greeted with great pomp and ceremony, in what was billed as a ""state visit-plus"".  He has tweeted several times since arriving in China - where Twitter is banned. But a White House official told reporters that he would ""tweet whatever he wants"". As part of his Asia trip Mr Trump has already visited South Korea and Japan, and will go on to Vietnam and the Philippines later in the week. By BBC's John Sudworth in Beijing You'd be forgiven for forgetting that the two men at the centre of this blossoming bromance are meant to be strategic rivals.  Across the negotiating table, Mr Trump held Mr Xi's gaze. ""My feeling towards you is incredibly warm,"" he said. It's a statement that in many other circumstances might lead the recipient to glance nervously in the direction of the exit. Mr Xi just smiled and nodded.  At the ceremony where US and Chinese businesses signed a number of deals, the US president appeared to have dropped his old China-bashing ways completely. His ""I don't blame China"" declaration over the trade imbalance was met with an audible gasp. Even here, one year on and 6,000 miles from the US presidential campaign trail, the audience couldn't quite believe what they were hearing. Is President Trump softening China up for tougher action on the trade imbalance further down the line? Maybe. But as the two men left the podium he had another gift for his Chinese host. Both men refused to take questions from the press. US presidents used to stand up for press freedom on visits to China. Not this one. What has Trump said about your country?"
geopolitical tensions,"N Korea, Burma top Asean agenda",2024-09-15,2012-04-03,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-17582138,"Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen addressed the opening ceremony Asean leaders are meeting in Cambodia, with North Korea's planned rocket launch, Burma's by-election and the South China Sea topping the agenda. The two-day summit is taking place in the capital, Phnom Penh. Foreign ministers of the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations, meeting ahead of their heads of state, have expressed concern over Pyongyang's plans to launch a rocket in April. They also gave Sunday's ''orderly'' vote in Burma a strong endorsement.  Asean agreed last November that Burma could take the chair of the regional bloc in 2014. The leaders of the country's military-backed civilian government allowed foreign observers for the 1 April poll for the first time, extending the invitation to Asean, as well as representatives from the European Union and United States. Indonesia's Foreign Minister Marty Natalegawa said the poll was ""an opportunity for Myanmar [Burma] to make the reform process even more irreversible"". Asean leaders have long adopted a light touch towards Burma's military government while other countries imposed sanctions, says the BBC's Guy Delauney in Phnom Penh.  They will be keen to acclaim the weekend's elections and other recent reforms as vindication of their stance, says our correspondent. North Korea's planned rocket launch between 12 to 16 April - which it says will put a satellite in orbit to mark the centenary of late leader Kim Il-sung's birth - has also emerged as a key issue for the summit.  The US says the launch will be a disguised long-range missile test that breaches UN resolutions.  On Sunday, the Philippines lodged protests with Pyongyang's representatives at the United Nations, in China, one of North Korea's closest allies, and at Asean. US Assistant Secretary of State Kurt Campbell said that the rocket path will be between Australia, Indonesia and the Philippines. Another geopolitical issue likely to surface is the tension with China over the disputed South China Sea region. China has overlapping territorial claims with several Asean members - the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei. Chinese President Hu Jintao visited Phnom Penh over the weekend, prior to the summit. The host country's close relationship with Beijing may cause awkward moments if the South China Sea issue comes up, says our correspondent. Asean was set up on 8 August 1967 by founder members Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Singapore.  Brunei joined in 1984, followed by Vietnam in 1995, Laos and Burma in 1997 and Cambodia in 1999.  The summit's main agenda on Tuesday is its goal of becoming a EU-like bloc by 2015. Asean Secretary-General Surin Pitsuwan said the group is ''on track"" to meet the deadline. Asean asked to monitor Burma vote Burma to chair Asean bloc in 2014 What is the South China Sea dispute?

geopolitical tensions,Why unity is thin on the ground as UN meets in New York,2024-09-15,2023-09-19,By James Landale,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66846608,"It is called the United Nations - but right now it seems anything but united.  The 140 or so world leaders gathering in New York for their annual assembly have a lot on their plate: Russia's invasion of Ukraine, a global cost of living crisis, a worsening climate emergency, and the disruption of new technologies such as artificial intelligence.  There are disagreements internationally not only over what is most important but also what the remedies should be.  ""People are looking to their leaders for a way out of this mess,"" says Antonio Guterres, the UN Secretary General.  ""Yet in the face of all this and more, geopolitical divisions are undermining our capacity to respond.""  A new multi-polar world is emerging, he says, leading to ""escalating tensions, fragmentation and worse"". Take Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky will want to rally support from world leaders in New York, in what will be a key test of international opinion about Russia's invasion. He will address the UN general assembly for the first time in person, before taking part in a debate at the UN security council. Naturally Mr Zelensky will urge existing allies to maintain their support despite concerns about the slow progress of his army's counter-offensive against Russian forces. But he is also expected to use the opportunity to ask for fresh backing from world leaders from countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America, many of whom have refused to condemn Russia's invasion.  There is an awareness in both the West and in Ukraine that there is a need to remake their argument to the so-called Global South, where many countries have failed to condemn Russia's invasion and would prefer the war to end, even if that means Ukraine ceding territory. Western powers want to make the point that the war is not just a European security issue but an economic crisis that affects the whole world. The problem Mr Zelensky and his Western allies face is that many leaders want the annual UN gathering to focus more on the climate crisis and their economic difficulties rather than the war in Europe. The UN general secretary, Mr Guterres, has recognised this and is hosting separate summits to discuss the world's faltering efforts to reduce poverty and address climate change.   UN members signed up to 17 so-called ""sustainable development goals"" (known as SDGs) in 2015. These targets - such as ending extreme poverty and tackling the climate crisis - are supposed to be met by 2030. But most are off track because of the pandemic, rising debt and global inaction - as well as the war in Ukraine.  So, Mr Guterres is looking for a new economic stimulus for the SDGs, and reforms to encourage international financial institutions to focus more on developing countries' needs. Western leaders have recognised these tensions - between their security concerns and the economic worries of the Global South - and have come to New York promising action on global development issues.  Jake Sullivan, the US national security adviser, said President Joe Biden was ""eager"" to use his UN speech ""to mobilise financial resources for the Global South for development and infrastructure needs"".  While the UK foreign secretary, James Cleverly - who is in New York - said the SDGs were ""seriously off track and we need to come together and recommit and accelerate their delivery by 2030"". But Western diplomats said this week that the UN was also a chance to convince neutral countries that Russia's invasion of Ukraine affected them all, damaging economies by raising food and energy costs.  ""We should be able to walk and chew gum,"" one diplomat said.  ""If all we do is turn up at these events and go on about Ukraine, it doesn't help the broader agenda.  ""So part of it is making sure we are explaining the implications of [Russian President Vladimir] Putin's illegal invasion, especially the food security. But also that we are taking action on other issues, like the SDGs and climate financing."" This may be a task made harder by the fact that some Western leaders have chosen not to come to New York, including President Emmanuel Macron of France and the UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.  Mr Sunak has blamed diary pressures but critics have accused him of damaging Britain's international reputation. He will be represented instead by the Deputy Prime Minister, Oliver Dowden.  As is usual, Mr Putin will not attend. But his foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, is coming and is expected to defend Russia's self-declared ""special military operation"" in Ukraine.  At their recent summit in India, the G20 nations chose not to invite Mr Zelensky and avoided condemning Russia by name for its aggression against Ukraine. Diplomats are hoping the fact that Ukraine's president will be coming to the UN in person will make it harder for countries to remain silent. The United Nations general assembly will thus be a key moment for political leaders to meet and discuss the world's crises. But unity - the very watchword of this organisation - may be thin on the ground. "
geopolitical tensions,"Win or lose, Trump has already changed the world",2024-09-15,2020-10-23,By Rebecca Seales,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2020-54541907,"The president of the United States is not just the leader of his country, he is probably the most powerful person on Earth. What he does changes life for all of us. Donald Trump is no exception. So how exactly has Mr Trump changed the world? President Trump has repeatedly declared the US ""the greatest country in the world"". But according to a recent 13-nation poll by the Pew Research Center, he hasn't done much for its image overseas. In many European countries, the percentage of the public with a positive view of America is at its lowest for almost 20 years. In the UK, 41% had a favourable opinion, while in France it was 31%, the lowest since 2003, and in Germany just 26%.  America's response to the coronavirus pandemic was a major factor - only 15% of respondents felt the US had handled the virus well, according to figures from July and August. It's hard to pin down what President Trump believes about climate change, as he's called it everything from ""an expensive hoax"", to a ""serious subject"" that is ""very important to me"". What is clear is that six months into the job, he dismayed scientists by announcing America's withdrawal from the Paris climate accord, which committed nearly 200 countries to keeping global temperature rises well under 2C.  The US is the second-biggest emitter of greenhouse gases behind China, and researchers have warned that if Mr Trump is re-elected, it may become impossible to keep global warming in check. Rejecting the Paris agreement, the president claimed it ""would have been shutting down American producers with excessive regulatory restrictions"". This has been a theme for Mr Trump, who has removed a raft of pollution regulations to cut the cost of producing coal, oil and gas. Several US coal mines have still closed, however, driven by competition from cheaper natural gas and state efforts to support renewable energy. Government figures show renewable sources generated more energy than coal in the US in 2019, for the first time in more than 130 years.  America's exit from the Paris climate deal formally takes effect on 4 November, the day after the presidential election. Joe Biden has pledged to rejoin the pact if he wins. Fears that the US pull-out would prompt a domino effect have not been realised, although some observers believe it smoothed the path for Brazil and Saudi Arabia to block progress on cutting carbon emissions. President Trump set out his stall on immigration just a week after his inauguration, closing US borders to travellers from seven Muslim-majority countries. Currently 13 nations are subject to tight travel restrictions. The number of foreign-born people living in the US was about 3% higher in 2019 than in 2016, President Obama's last year in office. But who those immigrants are has changed.  The percentage of US residents born in Mexico has fallen steadily during Mr Trump's term, while the number who moved from elsewhere in Latin America and the Caribbean has increased. There has also been a general tightening of the number of visas enabling people to settle permanently in the US - particularly for relatives of those already living there. If there's an emblem of President Trump's immigration policy, it's surely the ""big, beautiful wall"" he swore to build on the border with Mexico. As of 19 October, US Customs and Border Protection says 371 miles of wall have been constructed - almost all of it replacement fencing where barriers already existed. The work did not deter those desperate to reach America. The number of migrants detained at the US-Mexico border hit its highest level for 12 years in 2019, spurred by a peak in arrivals during the spring. More than half were families, mostly from Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador, where violence and poverty are driving people to seek asylum and a new life elsewhere. Turning to refugees, Donald Trump has made swingeing cuts to the number who can resettle in America. The US took in almost 85,000 refugees in the fiscal year 2016, which fell to under 54,000 people the following year.  In 2021, the maximum will be 15,000 people - the fewest since the refugee programme launched in 1980. ""I think one of the greatest of all terms I've come up with is 'fake',"" Donald Trump said in an October 2017 interview. Although the president definitely didn't invent the term ""fake news"", it's fair to say he popularised it. According to social media posts and audio transcripts monitored by Factba.se, he has used the phrase about 2,000 times since first tweeting it in December 2016. Search Google for ""fake news"" today and you'll get more than 1.1 billion results from all over the world. Charted over time, you can see how US interest rose in the winter of 2016-17, and spiked the week the president unveiled what he called the ""Fake News Awards"", a list of news stories he viewed as false. During the 2016 White House race, ""fake news"" meant untrue reports like one about Pope Francis endorsing Mr Trump for the presidency. But as it seeped into popular usage, that meaning shifted away from being just about misinformation. The president has frequently used ""fake news"" to attack news stories he disagrees with. In February 2017, he took it further, branding several news outlets ""the enemy of the American people"". It's a term that's been picked up by leaders in Thailand, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, among others, and some have used allegations of spreading ""fake news"" to justify repression and prosecutions against opposition activists and journalists. Civil society groups say that by using the term against credible reporting, politicians fundamentally undermine democracy, which relies on people agreeing what the basic facts are. In his February 2019 State of the Union address, President Trump pledged to withdraw US troops from Syria, declaring: ""Great nations do not fight endless wars."" The numbers paint a more nuanced story. Not least because months down the line, Mr Trump decided to keep about 500 troops in Syria after all to protect oil wells. The president has scaled back the presence he inherited in Afghanistan, and to an extent in Iraq and Syria. But American forces are still everywhere they were the day he took office. There are ways to impact on the Middle East without troops, of course. President Trump overturned the objections of previous presidents by moving the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in 2018, and recognising the city, including its occupied East, as Israel's capital. Last month he hailed the ""dawn of a new Middle East"" when the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain signed agreements normalising relations with Israel - a move the US helped broker.  Rhetoric aside, this was perhaps the most significant diplomatic achievement of the Trump administration. The two Gulf states are just the third and fourth Arab nations in the Middle East to recognise Israel since it declared independence in 1948.  President Trump seems to scorn deals he didn't broker. On his first day in office, he dumped the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a 12-nation trade deal approved by President Obama, after branding it ""horrible"". The withdrawal mostly benefited China, which viewed the deal as an attempt to curb its influence in the Asia-Pacific region. But in the US, critics who felt the agreement would compromise American jobs cheered its demise. Mr Trump also renegotiated the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico, which he called ""perhaps the worst trade deal ever made"". Its replacement left much unchanged, but toughened up labour provisions and rules on the sourcing of car parts. The president's real fixation has been how America benefits from trade with the world. The outcome was a bitter trade war with China, in which the world's two largest economies imposed hundreds of billions of dollars of taxes on each other's goods. It's been a headache for US soybean farmers and the tech and auto industries. China was affected too, as businesses moved their manufacturing to countries like Vietnam and Cambodia to lower their costs. For 2019, the US trade deficit in goods with China was slightly under its 2016 level. American companies imported less as they sought to avoid Mr Trump's tariffs.  However, despite the coronavirus pandemic heavily influencing trends for 2020. America still imports more goods than it exports.  This Trump tweet refers to a policy rollback so stunning that the phone call in question has its own Wikipedia page. On 2 December 2016, Mr Trump (then president-elect) took the highly unusual step of speaking directly to the president of Taiwan - breaking with a precedent set in 1979, when formal relations were cut. Carrie Gracie, then the BBC's China editor, predicted the move would prompt ""alarm and anger"" in Beijing, which sees Taiwan as a province of China not an independent state. The bold opener from Mr Trump was the first in a multi-pronged poking contest between the great geopolitical rivals, which has sunk relations to their lowest point in years. The US has irked China by declaring its territorial claims in the South China Sea illegal, heaping tariffs on its goods, banning downloads of the popular apps TikTok and WeChat, and blacklisting Chinese telecoms giant Huawei - which it claims is a threat to national security.  But the tensions did not begin under Mr Trump, and are driven in part by China's own actions. President Xi Jinping, in power since 2013, has presided over a highly controversial national security law in Hong Kong, and the mass imprisonment of China's Muslim minority Uighurs.  President Trump has renamed Covid-19 ""the China virus"", and while he may be keen to deflect scrutiny from his own handling of the pandemic, a change of US leadership wouldn't necessarily mean a more conciliatory tone. Democratic nominee Joe Biden has called President Xi a thug, and claimed the Chinese leader ""doesn't have a [democratic] bone in his body"". ""Iran will be held fully responsible for lives lost, or damage incurred, at any of our facilities. They will pay a very BIG PRICE! This is not a Warning, it is a Threat,"" Mr Trump tweeted on New Year's Eve, 2019. ""Happy New Year!"" Days later, to global shock, the US assassinated Qasem Suleimani, Iran's most powerful general, and the man who spearheaded its military operations in the Middle East. Iran retaliated, firing more than a dozen ballistic missiles at two American bases in Iraq. More than 100 US troops were injured, and analysts deemed the nations on the brink of war. There was no war, but innocent civilians still died: just hours after Iran's missile strikes, its military mistakenly shot down a Ukrainian passenger jet, killing all 176 people on board. How did it come to this? A series of mutual miscalculations made against a backdrop of mistrust. The US and Iran have been at loggerheads since 1979, when Iran's US-backed shah (its monarch) was overthrown, and 52 Americans were taken hostage inside the US embassy. In May 2018, Mr Trump ratcheted up tensions by abandoning a 2015 nuclear deal, under which Iran agreed to limit its nuclear programme in return for the lifting of economic sanctions. He then put in place what the White House called ""the toughest sanctions regime ever imposed"" - designed to compel Iran's leaders into a deal more to his liking.  Tehran refused to bend. The sanctions drove Iran's economy into severe recession, and by October 2019 the cost of food was up by 61% year-on-year and the price of tobacco by 80%. Suffering Iranians held widespread protests a month later.  While the coronavirus crisis has absorbed political attention in both hard-hit countries, their diplomatic channels remain few and their flashpoints numerous."
geopolitical tensions,Asian press gives Park cautious welcome,2024-09-15,2012-12-20,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-20796038,"Park will be South Korea's first female president Asian papers have cautiously greeted Park Geun-hye's victory in the South Korean presidential polls. In South Korea, commentators generally welcome her win but highlight immediate challenges ahead. The press in China takes an optimistic view that the new leader in Seoul will improve bilateral relations and possibly bring a ""special harmony"" as a female leader. A Hong Kong paper notes that she speaks Mandarin. A Japanese paper says it does not expect territorial concessions from Ms Park's government, but hopes that she will foster a cooperative relationship. Editorial in Yonhap news agency  She has made history by becoming South Korea's first female president, but she is expected to grapple with a long list of tough issues ranging from reviving the sluggish economy to mending relations with North Korea. Before formally taking office in February, Park is likely to focus on forming a government of national unity as her historic win in the presidential election came after a neck-and-neck race with the opposition's candidate, Moon Jae-in. Democratic United Party (DUP) candidate Moon Jae-In, who lost to Ms Park Editorial in conservative daily Dong-A Ilbo  President-elect Park Geun-hye clearly must put priority on achieving national unity by embracing the sense of loss felt by the 49% of the people who did not vote for her. As the country's first presidential candidate to win with more than half of the vote, she should not become a leader for just 50% of the population. Editorial in The Korea Herald  Park Geun-hye has no time to revel in her hard-won victory, facing a range of difficult tasks. The president-elect is set to go through tougher and more complicated external conditions and internal challenges than any previous leader. Article in centre-right JoongAng Daily  The incoming president faces a bumpy road ahead. The economy is collapsing, income and social disparities widening, and geopolitical tensions around the Korean Peninsula escalating. The authority bestowed upon the people's choice is no personal trophy to treasure and enjoy, but a heavy responsibility to tackle mounting difficult tasks. If the president-elect does not demonstrate the boldness and capability to navigate the storm and face the headwinds, Wednesday's victory will end up more a curse than a victory. Official Xinhua News Agency It is expected that she will be able to bring new opportunities for the development of China-ROK relations during her tenure... Needless to say, China and the ROK [Republic of Korea - South Korea] have differences on historical issues, fishing, 'defectors from the North' and other issues. This requires the two countries to strengthen co-operation, expand understanding, proceed from the overall situation of friendly co-operation, and properly handle affairs with a pragmatic attitude. Editorial in Huanqiu Shibao When more and more hostility and hatred are spreading across the region, we hope that the emergence of this female president can bring a special harmony to the overall atmosphere. We are looking forward to more predictability on the Korean Peninsula, as well as dual long-term stability in China-ROK relations on a strategic level and in civil society. Editorial in English-language Global Times South Korea is also a stakeholder in China's rise. We hope President Park Geun-hye can help South Korea understand this. It would benefit the country, and may also be a turning point in the tense regional situation. Article in official English-language China Daily  During the election campaign, Park proposed a 'trust-building process' on the peninsula. She obviously understands that improving ties between Seoul and Pyongyang caters to the interests of the two and the region as a whole. It is hoped she will translate her words into action soon. Editorial in Hong Kong's Wen Wei Po  Park Geun-hye is fluent in Chinese, has deep ties with China and adopts a friendly policy towards China, which will have positive significance in promoting China-ROK relations.  Editorial in Mainichi Shimbun  It goes without saying that Japan, the US and South Korea should consolidate ties. As far as Japan is concerned, there must be efforts to improve relations with South Korea. It is hoped that South Korea will not repeat futile friction in handling affairs... In a multilayered relationship that includes security, Japan and South Korea will have no choice other than to continue calm competition while aiming for co-existence and co-prosperity. Editorial in Sankei Shimbun  A female supreme leader has of course not appeared yet in Japan or even the US... We would like to express our congratulations and respect... Of course, as president of South Korea, she can never make concessions to Japan on territorial issues and historical issues. However, it is hoped that she will draw from the wisdom of her father's era to develop a co-operative relationship while taking into account the stance of the other side. Editorial in China Times   As the first female president with an East Asian Confucian cultural background, Park Geun-hye has received a great deal of international attention and her challenges are also extremely heavy. In addition to many issues of internal affairs, the economy and society, she must face fierce international competition, as well as the complex and elusive problem of North Korea. History has given an opportunity to Park Geun-hye and now is the time for her to prove herself.

geopolitical tensions,Trump says he will ban TikTok in the US,2024-09-15,2020-08-01,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-53619287,"President Donald Trump has announced he is banning the Chinese-owned video-sharing app TikTok in the US.   He told reporters he could sign an executive order as early as Saturday. US security officials have expressed concern that the app, owned by Chinese firm ByteDance, could be used to collect the personal data of Americans. TikTok has denied accusations that it is controlled by or shares data with the Chinese government. The fast-growing app has up to 80 million active monthly users in America and the ban would be a major blow for ByteDance. ""As far as TikTok is concerned, we're banning them from the United States,"" Mr Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One. It was not immediately clear what authority Mr Trump has to ban TikTok, how that ban would be enforced and what legal challenges it would face. Microsoft has reportedly been in talks to buy the app from ByteDance, but Mr Trump appeared to cast doubt that such a deal would be allowed to go through. If the deal went ahead reports say it would involve ByteDance shedding TikTok's US operations.  A TikTok spokesperson declined to comment on Mr Trump's mooted ban, but told US media outlets the company was ""confident in the long-term success of TikTok"" in the US. The move to ban TikTok comes at a time of heightened tensions between the Trump administration and the Chinese government over a number of issues, including trade disputes and Beijing's handling of the coronavirus outbreak. The platform has exploded in popularity in recent years, mostly with people under 20. They use the app to share 15-second videos that often involve lip-synching to songs, comedy routines and unusual editing tricks. These videos are then made available to both followers and strangers. By default, all accounts are public, although users can restrict uploads to an approved list of contacts. TikTok also allows private messages to be sent but this facility is limited to ""friends"". The app is reported to have around 800 million active monthly users, most of whom are in the US and India. India has already blocked TikTok as well as other Chinese apps. Australia, which has already banned Huawei and telecom equipment-maker ZTE, is also considering banning TikTok. Analysis by James Clayton, BBC North America technology correspondent Trump's dislike of TikTok goes further than just privacy concerns. In India TikTok was banned after a border skirmish with China - it was caught up in a geopolitical feud. And that's what's happened here, too. Trump's sights are set firmly on China - and this should be seen through that lens. TikTok says that it doesn't keep any data in China and would never give it to China. But, in many ways it doesn't matter what they say, the fact that they are owned by a Chinese's company is guilt enough. Not to be overlooked either is Trump's previous experience with TikTok. Last month users claimed to have scuppered his Tulsa rally after signing up to tickets they had no intention of using. And although there are Republican and conservative voices on TikTok, the profile of users in the US is generally young and liberal/left. It's hard to believe that's not a factor here. US officials and politicians have raised concerns data collected by ByteDance via TikTok may end up being passed to the Chinese government. TikTok operates a similar but separate version of the app in China, known as Douyin. It says all US user data is stored in the US, with a backup in Singapore. This week, TikTok told users and regulators it would observe a high level of transparency, including allowing reviews of its algorithms. ""We are not political, we do not accept political advertising and have no agenda - our only objective is to remain a vibrant, dynamic platform for everyone to enjoy,"" the CEO of TikTok, Kevin Mayer, said in a post this week. ""TikTok has become the latest target, but we are not the enemy."""
geopolitical tensions,'Human rights are universal' - FAs respond to Fifa,2024-09-15,2022-11-06,BBC Sport,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/63533589,"England captain Harry Kane will wearing a 'One Love' armband at the World Cup in Qatar Ten European football associations including those of England and Wales say ""human rights are universal and apply everywhere"" after Fifa asked nations competing at the Qatar World Cup to ""now focus on the football"". The world governing body wrote to all 32 teams following a controversial build-up to the tournament, which starts on 20 November. Host Qatar has been criticised for its stance on same-sex relationships, its human rights record and its treatment of migrant workers. The Fifa letter was criticised by Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and LGBTQ+ campaigners in England and Wales. While acknowledging the ""significant progress"" made by Qatar, a joint statement issued by members of the Uefa Working Group on human rights and labour rights said it would ""continue to press"" Fifa for answers on outstanding issues surrounding migrant workers. ""We acknowledge, and welcome, as we have done in the past, that significant progress has been made by Qatar, particularly with regards to the rights of migrant workers, with the impact of legislative changes demonstrated in the International Labour Organisation's recent reports,"" said the statement. ""We welcome the assurances given by the Qatari Government and by Fifa regarding the safety, security, and inclusion of all fans who travel to the World Cup, including LGBTQ+ fans. We also recognise that every country has issues and challenges and we agree with Fifa that diversity is a strength.  ""However, embracing diversity and tolerance also means supporting human rights. Human rights are universal and they apply everywhere."" Fifa's letter, signed by its president Gianni Infantino and secretary general Fatma Samoura, urged that football should not be ""dragged"" into ideological or political ""battles"" and it should not be ""handing out moral lessons"". Peaceful protests have been planned by some players, while England's Harry Kane and nine other captains of European teams will be wearing 'One Love' armbands. to promote diversity and inclusion. Denmark will wear ""toned-down"" shirts to protest against Qatar, with kit provider Hummel saying it ""does not wish to be visible"" in a tournament it claims ""has cost thousands of lives"", while Australia's squad have released a video urging Qatar to abolish its laws on same-sex relationships. England's FA has backed calls for compensation to be awarded for ""any injury or death related to any construction project"" for the World Cup. ""We will continue to support the momentum for positive, progressive change and continue to advocate for a conclusive outcome and update on the two key outstanding issues we have been discussing with Fifa for a long time,"" the Uefa Working Group's statement continued. ""Fifa has repeatedly committed to deliver concrete answers on these issues - the compensation fund for migrant workers, and the concept of a migrant workers centre to be created in Doha - and we will continue to press for these to be delivered.  ""We believe in the power of football to make further positive and credible contributions to progressive sustainable change in the world."" On Saturday, protests were held at Bundesliga games in Germany with fans holding up banners in the crowd. Qatar's Minister of Foreign Affairs Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani has said criticism of his country's hosting of the World Cup amounts to ""hypocrisy"", while calls for a boycott are ""are being peddled by a very small number of people, in 10 countries at most, who are not at all representative of the rest of the world"". And in an interview with Sky, external on Sunday, he added people ""cannot accept a small country from the Middle East"" hosting the World Cup. ""Preaching from a distance is not a solution,"" he said. Bayern Munich fans unveiled a banner protesting the Qatar World Cup after Fifa wrote to all 32 countries asking them to 'put football first' BBC sports editor Dan Roan While written diplomatically, this joint statement is a robust and defiant response to Fifa's remarkable 'stick to football' letter last week, which took the FA and the FAW by surprise, dismayed many in the sport, and which was widely condemned by human rights groups and LGBT+ campaigners.  The intention of these 10 west European federations is to firmly reassert their teams' right to make a stand on social issues in Qatar, such as the plan by England and Wales players to wear rainbow armbands as part of an anti-discrimination campaign in a country where it is illegal to be gay. And it is a clear rejection of Fifa's request that political and human rights concerns are put to one side for the duration of the World Cup amid a build-up that has been blighted by a myriad of ethical and geopolitical controversies, and an increasingly aggressive approach by the hosts towards their critics.  There is also a sense of the mounting frustration that many within European football feel over what the statement refers to as ""two key outstanding issues""; a Migrant Worker Centre and a compensation fund for those killed or injured during World Cup preparations. While acknowledging ""significant"" labour reforms, members of Uefa's Working Group on human rights had expected Fifa to help deliver progress on both these causes several months ago, and will hope that this will spur them into a renewed effort. With the start of the tournament just days away, it remains to be seen whether this statement helps, but it is certainly a reminder of the tension and division that surrounds final preparations for the event.

geopolitical tensions,What's the French word for bromance?,2024-09-15,2023-03-09,By Katya Adler,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-64891459,"Paris is world famous for romance. But what about bromance (or romance fraternelle, as the UK's French cousins might say)? An explosion of mutual admiration is predicted in the French capital this Friday when Prime Minister Rishi Sunak meets President Emmanuel Macron. But is bromance exaggerated? Perhaps a bit glib?  After seven years of pretty appalling Franco-British relations following the UK's Brexit vote, and with conventional warfare back and raging in Europe as Russia continues its bloody assault on Ukraine, there is a voracious appetite on both sides of the Channel for new beginnings and constructive co-operation. And there are remarkable similarities between the French and British leaders.  Former investment bankers and finance ministers, who attended elite schools, they are both ideologically from the centre-right. They were young when they took the reins of power: Mr Sunak is 42, while Mr Macron became the youngest president in French history at 39. Rather diminutive in stature, the two men are hugely ambitious. Part of their ""let's get down to business"" image is a liking for signature, sharply tailored, slim-cut navy suits. France's Le Monde newspaper noted, in a flourish of sartorial snobbery, that Mr Sunak's seemed ""too tight"".  But there are other similarities the two men probably prefer not to boast about.  Neither of them has a convincing popular mandate. Mr Sunak became prime minister after his predecessor's resignation. Mr Macron's Renaissance party runs a minority government after punishing parliamentary elections.  The two leaders are beset by public sector strikes: over pay in the UK and pensions in France. Critics accuse them of arrogance at times and of seeming distant from the concerns of most voters. Mr Sunak, because of his personal wealth; the French president, for his grand manner. He's mockingly dubbed ""Jupiter"" at home, implying he sees himself as godlike, and also ""president of the rich"" because of some of his policies. Of course, Mr Sunak voted for Brexit, while Mr Macron once touted himself as Mr Europe. They are by no means two peas in a pod. But in a post-Brexit and post-pandemic world challenged by Russia and China, they share an apparent conviction that political pragmatism, rather than dogmatic ideology, is the order of the day. London and Paris have billed Friday's summit as ambitious - covering immigration, the environment, Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Iran's nuclear programme, civil nuclear co-operation, bilateral trade, youth opportunities, how to handle China and more. But what can actually be achieved in such a short meeting? Is this more symbolism than content? Mr Macron has a defence and security message uppermost in his mind. Mr Sunak has a big focus on migration, as I discuss below. But as the UK's ambassador to France Menna Rawlings pointed out in a French media interview, what was important was actually getting the two sides together at this high level after five years. Meetings like this between the UK and France used to happen pretty much annually. Covid has been a factor in the summit-freeze, of course, but it was the Brexit process that really opened a chasm of bad-tempered bitterness between these two countries with their long history of frenemy-ship.  Now though, the enormity of the geopolitical crisis over Russia and Ukraine and the impact it's having on wider continental security and on energy prices has helped focus minds and calm relations, reminding both sides of the values they share.   French political commentator Pierre Haski predicts Mr Macron will use the summit on Friday to showcase France and the UK as big military powers, standing side-by-side and shoulder-to-shoulder. They are Europe's only significant military players (Germany's pledge to become one will take a very long time to realise). Both countries have a seat on the UN security council. Both are nuclear powers - testing their warheads at the same facility in France - and they've worked very closely together inside Nato since the start of Russia's invasion.  Mr Haski notes that Mr Macron, a long-time champion of boosting European defence (not necessarily an ""EU army""), with individual countries investing more in security, has seen his dream finally taking shape - and yet it's been the US, not France, leading the way in the face of Moscow's aggression. ""He needs to be seen to be playing the Nato game,"" says Mr Haski. Meanwhile Mr Sunak will arrive in Paris this Friday with migration very much on his mind. He's made stemming the arrival of migrants to the UK one of five pledges against which he says he should be judged by voters come next year's general election. But tough words at home and a cosier relationship with Paris won't stop the people-smugglers' boats trying to cross the Channel. And this is an issue where expectations of the summit should probably be limited. Numbers have been steadily on the rise - 46,000 people crossed those waters in small boats last year alone - grabbing UK headlines, causing tragic loss of life and leading over time to much finger pointing between Britain and France. The UK says Paris hasn't been doing enough to stop the dinghies leaving along France's coastline, despite increasing UK financial support. France rejects the accusation, saying it prevented over 30,000 people making the crossing last year. The French government receives an estimated three times as many asylum claims as the UK annually. It insists, when it comes to small boats across the Channel, it's suffering the effects of the UK's asylum policy - something the UK government strongly contests. ""Migration is not only an issue for the UK,"" an Elysée official said again pointedly this week. ""We need to accept a broader focus. It is not Britain versus the continent, or Britain versus France. It is very much a global issue."" Both sides have already spoken of their ambitious co-operation agreements to crackdown on people smuggling gangs. They openly admit it's a shared problem. But what Mr Sunak is unlikely to get in public, or private, despite the new warm mood of Franco-British pragmatism, is an assurance from Mr Macron that France will take back asylum-seekers who've crossed the Channel from his country. That scenario has been described to me by a number of French journalists as politically toxic. The left would accuse Mr Macron of doing the UK's policing for them, they say, while the far right would accuse him of filling up France with those they label ""illegal migrants"". It's not the first time the French have protested to UK lawmakers that ""we have politics too."" I heard the same argument often, during those bitter post-Brexit negotiations with the EU, where Mr Macron appeared to relish the role of ""bad cop"" - even though, in reality, his position was rarely dissimilar to that of the other big EU power, Germany. The UK became engulfed in a domestic political crisis post-Brexit, but the concern of Mr Macron, an overt champion of the EU, those close to him would say, was that if the UK got the advantages of bloc membership after leaving (such as a favourable financial services deal or customs breaks) that would play into the hands of the increasingly popular French far right which, in those days, was agitating for ""Frexit"" - that is, France leaving the European Union.  That, in the French president's mind, according to Macron-watchers, was a key reason for sounding tough on Brexit, as well as the wider EU argument of ""protecting their single market"".  Former UK ambassador to France Peter Ricketts thinks Franco-British ties suffered particularly badly after Brexit because of the two countries' closeness: ""The friction of Brexit fell on to the UK-French relationship. We live next door to each other. No country has closer links to us in so many ways, whether it's through family, business, or war commemorations. We are so very alike that our relationship is often a competitive one. It's like sibling rivalry."" Many UK politicians and much of the country's popular press believed Paris was out to punish its neighbour, dismissively nicknamed ""Les Rosbifs"". There were rows over customs, migrant smuggler dinghies and fishing rights (including the UK getting out the gunboats in 2021 as both countries postured out at sea). Boris Johnson's successor as prime minister, Liz Truss, publicly questioned whether the French president was a friend or foe to the United Kingdom. But now says, Pierre Haski, ""No-one in France talks about Brexit. It hardly features at all in the French media."" Deals with the UK won't be viewed in those terms anymore. And EU membership is more popular in France these days, even if a distaste for Brussels' perceived interference is still widespread. It's also important to point out, that while Franco-British political relations have been fractious and strained over the last years, contacts of course continued between the cross-Channel neighbours.  Ambassador Ricketts spoke to me with enthusiasm about King Charles' upcoming trip to France, closely co-ordinated with Downing Street. You could say it's the icing on the gâteau of a sweeter Franco-British understanding. This will be the King's first state visit. And the French, Peter Ricketts observes are ""really touched."" It's a strong symbol of the ties between the two countries, he says, that rises above politics.  The French - who violently finished off their own monarchy a couple of hundred years ago - are rather obsessed by, you could say enamoured with, the British Royal Family, an influential figure at the Elysée confided in me. ""We all watched the [TV series] The Crown. We were addicted,"" she gushed. Ahead of Friday's summit the Elysée Palace told journalists that France and the UK are ""committed not only to work together, but to work together for the benefit of each other."" Translation: the two countries are no longer in post-Brexit defensive mode. There's a new confidence that cooperating and collaborating won't immediately be seen as a win for one, or the weakness of the other.  ""Emmanuel Macron is willing to invest in Rishi Sunak,"" Lord Ricketts told me, even though the prime minister faces a general election next year, with the odds stacked against him. I once heard Franco-British relations likened to a climate, rather than an evolving relationship. If that is the case, the weather is currently looking clement. Rishi Sunak's recent Brexit deal with the EU over Northern Ireland has also really helped the bilateral atmosphere. Paving the way for possible new deals to ease other post-Brexit complications like trade hurdles at Dover and Calais, and job opportunities in France and the UK for youngsters. "
geopolitical tensions,What this crisis reveals about US - and its president,2024-09-15,2020-03-24,By Nick Bryant,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52012049,"There are no fresh flowers at the 9/11 Memorial any more. An American altar usually decorated with roses, carnations and postcard-sized Stars and Stripes is sequestered behind a makeshift plastic railing. Broadway, the ""Great White Way"", is dark. The subway system is a ghost train. Staten Island ferries keep cutting through the choppy waters of New York harbour, passing Lady Liberty on the way in and out of Lower Manhattan, but hardly any passengers are on board. Times Square, normally such a roiling mass, is almost devoid of people.  In the midst of this planetary pandemic, nobody wants to meet any more at the ""Crossroads of the World"". A city known for its infectious energy, a city that likes to boast it never even has to sleep, has been forced into hibernation. With more cases than any other American conurbation, this city is once again Ground Zero, a term no New Yorker ever wanted applied here again. With manic suddenness, our world has been turned upside down, just as it was on September 11th. Nations, like individuals, reveal themselves at times of crisis. In emergencies of this immense magnitude, it soon becomes evident whether a sitting president is equal to the moment. So what have we learnt about the United States as it confronts this national and global catastrophe? Will lawmakers on Capitol Hill, who have been in a form of legislative lockdown for years now, a paralysis borne of partisanship, rise to the challenge? And what of the man who now sits behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office, who has cloaked himself in the mantle of ""wartime president""? Of the three questions, the last one is the least interesting, largely because Donald Trump's response has been so predictable. He has not changed. He has not grown. He has not admitted errors. He has shown little humility. Instead, his critics say, all the hallmarks of his presidency have been on agitated display: his boasts - he has awarded himself a 10 out of 10 for his handling of the crisis. The politicisation of what should be the apolitical - he toured the Centers for Disease Control wearing a campaign cap emblazoned with the slogan ""Keep America Great"".  His truth-twisting: he now claims to have fully appreciated the scale of the pandemic early on, despite dismissing and downplaying the threat for weeks. His attacks on the ""fake news"" media, including a personal assault on a White House reporter who asked what was his message to frightened Americans: ""I tell them you are a terrible reporter."" His mocking of Senator Mitt Romney, the only Republican who voted at the end of the impeachment trial for his removal from office, for going into isolation.   His continued attacks on government institutions in the forefront of confronting the crisis - ""the Deep State Department"" is how he described the State Department from his presidential podium the morning after it issued its most extreme travel advisory urging Americans to refrain from all international travel. His obsession with ratings, or in this instance, confirmed case numbers - he stopped a cruise ship docking on the West Coast, noting: ""I like the numbers where they are.  I don't need to have the numbers double because of one ship that wasn't our fault."" His compulsion for hype - declaring the combination of hydroxycholoroquine and azithromycin ""one of the biggest game-changers in the history of medicine,"" even as medical officials warn against offering false hope.  His lack of empathy. Rather than soothing words for relatives of those who have died, or words of encouragement and appreciation for those in the medical trenches, Trump's daily White House briefings commonly start with a shower of self-congratulation. After Trump has spoken, Mike Pence, his loyal deputy, usually delivers a paean of praise to the president. His appeal to xenophobia that has always been the sine qua non of his political business model - repeatedly he describes the disease as the ""Chinese virus"". Just as he scapegoated China and Mexican immigrants for decimating America's industrial heartland ahead of the 2016 presidential election, he is blaming Beijing for the coronavirus outbreak in an attempt to win re-election.  My judgement is that his attempt at economic stewardship has been more convincing than his mastery of public health. A lesson from financial shocks of the past, most notably the meltdown in 2008, is to ""go big"" early on. That he has tried to do. But here, as well, there are shades of his showman self. He seems to have rounded on the initial figure of a trillion dollars for the stimulus package because it sounds like such a gargantuan number - a fiscal eighth wonder of the world.   Trump favours simple solutions to complex problems. He closed America's border to those who had travelled to China, a sensible move in hindsight. However, the coronavirus outbreak has required the kind of multi-pronged approach and long-term thinking that seems beyond him. This has always been a presidency of the here and now. It is not well equipped to deal with a public health and economic emergency that will dominate the rest of his presidency, whether he only gets to spend the next 10 months in the White House or another five years.  The Trump presidency has so often been about creating favourable optics even in the absence of real progress - his nuclear summitry with the North Korean despot Kim Jong-un offers a case in point. But such tactics do not work as well in a national emergency. What have we learnt of the United States? First of all, we have seen the enduring goodness of this country.  As with 9/11, we have marvelled at the selflessness and bravery of its first responders - the nurses, doctors, medical support staff and ambulance drivers who have turned up to the work with the same sense of public spiritedness shown by the firefighters who rushed towards the flaming Twin Towers. We've witnessed the ingenuity and creativity of schools that have transitioned to remote, online teaching without missing a beat.  We've seen a can-do spirit that has kept stores open, shelves stocked and food being delivered. In other words, most Americans have shown precisely the same virtues we have seen in every country brought to a halt by the virus.  As for the American exceptionalism on display, much of it has been of the negative kind that makes it hard not to put head in hands. The lines outside gun stores. The spike in online sales of firearms - Ammo.com has seen a 70% increase in sales. The panic buying of AR-15s. Some Christian fundamentalists have rejected the epidemiology of this pandemic. To prove there was no virus, a pastor in Arkansas boasted his parishioners were prepared to lick the floor of his church.  Once again, those who live in developed nations have been left to ponder why the world's richest country does not have a system of universal healthcare. Ten years after the passage of Obamacare, more than 26 million Americans do not have health insurance. Rather than a coming together, the crisis has demonstrated how for decades Americans have conducted a political version of social distancing: the herd-like clustering of conservatives and liberals into like-minded communities caused by the allergic reaction to compatriots holding opposing political views. Once again, we have seen the familiar two Americas divide, the usual knee-jerk tribalism. Republicans have been twice as likely as Democrats to view coronavirus coverage as exaggerated. Three-quarters of Republicans say they trust the information coming from the president, whereas the figure among Democrats is just 8%.  As the Reverend Josh King told the Washington Post despairingly: ""In your more politically conservative regions, closing is not interpreted as caring for you. It's interpreted as liberalism."" Even on 13 March, when the CDC projected that up to 214 millions could be infected, Sean Davis, the co-founder of the right-wing website, The Federalist, tweeted: ""Corporate political media hate you, they hate the country, and they will stop at nothing to reclaim power to rule over you. If that means destroying the economy via a panic they helped incite, all while running interference for the communist country that started it, so be it."" The latest Gallup polling shows the split: 94% of Republicans approve of his handling of the crisis, compared with 27% of Democrats. But overall, six out of ten Americans approve, pushing his approval rating up again to 49%, matching the highest score of his presidency. As with previous crises, such as 9/11, Americans tend to rally around the presidency, although Donald Trump remains a deeply polarising figure. After the attacks of September 11th, George W Bush's approval rating was over 90. The political geography of America, with its red and blue state separatism, has even affected how voters are being physically exposed to the virus. Democrats tend to congregate in the cities, whose dense populations have made them hotspots. Republicans tend to live in more sparsely populated rural areas, which so far have not been so badly hit. Thus, the polarisation continues amidst the pandemic. Rather than to the Trump White House, much of ""Blue America"" has looked for leadership to its state capitals: Democratic governors such as Andrew Cuomo in New York (who Trump tweeted should ""do more""), Gavin Newsom in California (whom Trump has praised) and Jay Inslee in Washington state (whom the president called a ""snake"" during his visit to the CDC).  For American liberals, Dr Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has become the subversive hero of the hour. Offering an antidote to this post-truth presidency, Fauci sticks to scientific facts. After repeatedly contradicting Donald Trump over the seriousness of the outbreak, he is on his way to being viewed with the same affection and reverence as the liberal Supreme Court jurist Ruth Bader Ginsburg.  Surely the coronavirus outbreak will eventually lead to an end momentarily to the gridlock on Capitol Hill. Legislators have no other choice but to legislate given the enormity of the economic crisis and the spectre of a 21st Century Great Depression.  However, the first two attempts to pass a stimulus package failed amidst the usual partisan acrimony and brinksmanship. Republicans and Democrats are arguing over whether to include expansions of paid leave and unemployment benefits, and what the Democrats are calling a slush fund for corporate America that could be open to abuse. Once again, Capitol Hill's dysfunction has been shown to be both systemic and endemic.  Given the scale of the public health and economic crisis, the hope would be of a return to the patriotic bipartisanship that prevailed during much of the Fifties and early Sixties, which produced some of the major post-war reforms such as the construction of the interstate highway system and the landmark civil rights acts. History, after all, shows that US politicians co-operate most effectively in the face of a common enemy, whether it was the Soviet Union during the Cold War or al-Qaeda in the initial months after 9/11.  But the early response of lawmakers on Capitol Hill is far from encouraging. And if there is cross-party co-operation - as there will surely be in the end - it will not be the product of patriotic bipartisanship but rather freak-out bipartisanship, the legislative equivalent of panic buying.  The paradox here, as lawmakers face-off, is that crises erase philosophical lines. As in 2008, ideological conservatives have overnight become operational liberals. Those who ordinarily detest government have come in this emergency to depend on it. Corporate America, which is generally phobic towards federal intervention, is now desperate for government bailouts.  Trickle-down supply siders have become Keynesian big spenders, such is their desire for government stimulus spending funded by the taxpayer. Even universal basic income, a fringe idea popularised by the Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang, has gone mainstream. The US government intends to give $1,200 payments to every American.  In this call to national action, we have been reminded of how the federal government has been run down over the past 40 years partly because of an anti-government onslaught that started with Ronald Reagan. In 2018, the team responsible for pandemic response on the National Security Council at the White House was disbanded. The failure to carry out adequate testing, the key to containing outbreaks early on, is linked to a funding shortfall at the Department of Health and Human Services.  As with the attacks of 11 September 2001, warnings within government were repeatedly ignored. In recent years, there have been numerous exercises to test the country's preparedness for a pandemic - one of which involved a respiratory virus originating from China - that identified exactly the areas of vulnerability now being exposed. As with Hurricane Katrina, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has struggled. As ever, there are tensions between federal agencies and the states. The institutional decline of government that led so many Americans to pin their faith in an individual, Donald Trump, is again plain to see, whether in the shortage of masks and protective gowns or the dearth of early testing.  Consequently, America's claim to global pre-eminence looks less convincing by the day. While in previous crises, the world's most powerful superpower might have mobilised a global response, nobody expects that of the United States anymore. The neo-isolationism of three years of America Firstism has created a geopolitical form of social distancing, and this crisis has reminded us of the oceanic divide that has opened up even with Washington's closest allies. Take the European travel ban, which Trump announced during his Oval Office address to the nation without warning the countries affected. The European Union complained, in an unusually robust public statement, the decision was ""taken unilaterally and without consultation"".  Nor has the United States offered a model for how to deal with this crisis. South Korea, with its massive testing programme, and Japan have been exemplars. China, too, has shown the advantages of its authoritarianism system in enforcing a strict lockdown, which is especially worrying when the western liberal order looks so wobbly. Hopefully, nobody will forget how officials in China tried to cover up the virus for weeks and silenced whistleblowers, showing the country's ugly autocratic side even as the outbreak was spreading. But whereas Beijing managed to build a new hospital in just 10 days, the Pentagon will take weeks to move a naval hospital ship from its port in Virginia to New York harbour.  Politically, there will be so many ramifications. It is worth remembering, for example, that the Tea Party was as much a reaction to what was called the ""big government conservatism"" of George W Bush in response to the financial crisis as it was to the pigmentation of Barack Obama. The official history of the Tea Party movement states it came into existence on 3 October, 2008, when Bush signed into law TARP, the Troubled Asset Relief Programme which saved the failing banks. Tea-Partiers viewed that as an unacceptable encroachment of government power.  Likewise, it is worth bearing in mind that the two major convulsions of the 21st Century, the destruction of the Twin Towers and the collapse of Lehman Brothers, both ended up having a polarising effect on US politics. The fragile bipartisan 9/11 consensus was shattered by the Bush administration's decision to invade Iraq. The financial crisis fuelled the rise of the Tea Party and further radicalised the Republican Party.  What will be the impact on the presidential election? Judging by the Lazarus-like revival of Joe Biden, the signs are that Democrats are voting for normal. Clearly, a significant majority is not in the mood for the political revolution promised by Bernie Sanders. A 78-year-old whose candidacy was almost derailed in its early stages because he was so tactile looks again like a strong candidate in these socially distant times.  Many Americans are yearning for precisely the kind of empathy and personal warmth that Biden offers. Even before the coronavirus took hold, he had made recovery his theme, a narrative in accord with his life story. Many also want a presidency they could have on in the background. A less histrionic figure in the Oval Office. Soft jazz rather than heavy metal. A return to some kind of normalcy. But who would make any predictions? Only a few weeks ago, when the chaos of the Iowa caucuses seemed like a major story, we were prophesying Biden's political demise. Besides, normalcy is not something we can expect to see for months, maybe even for years. Rather, the coronavirus could dramatically reshape American politics, much like the other massive historical convulsions of the past 100 years.  The Great Depression led to the New Deal, and its massive extension of federal power, through welfare programmes such as Social Security. It also made the Democrats, the champions of government, politically dominant. From 1932 onwards, the party won five consecutive presidential elections. World War II, among other social changes, gave impetus to the struggle for black equality, as African-American infantrymen who fought fascism on the same battlefields as white GIs demanded the same menu of civil rights on their return home. The attacks of 11 September made many Americans more wary of mass immigration and religious pluralism. The Great Recession undermined faith in the American Dream.  How America changes as a result of coronavirus will be determined by how America responds.  Liberals may be hoping the outbreak will highlight the need for universal healthcare, a New Deal-style revival of government, the return of a more fact-based polity and a stronger response to global warming, another planetary crisis which has the potential to paralyse and overwhelm so much of the world.  Conservatives may conclude the private sector rather than government is better equipped to deal with crises, amplifying their anti-government rhetoric, that gun controls should be further relaxed so that Americans can better protect themselves, and that individual liberties should not be constrained by nanny states. Every day on my way to work, I pass the 9/11 memorial where the Twin Towers once stood, and watch people laying their flowers and muttering their quiet prayers. Many is the time I have wondered whether I would ever cover a more world-altering event. As I look out of my window on a quiet and eerie city that feels more like Gotham than New York, I fear we may be confronting it now.

geopolitical tensions,What does China want from the Ukraine crisis?,2024-09-15,2022-02-03,By Tessa Wong,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-60242549,"As the war of words between the US and Russia grows louder over Ukraine, one major player on the international stage has spoken up firmly as well: China. In recent days, Beijing has called for calm on both sides and the end of a Cold War mentality, while also making it clear it supports Moscow's concerns. It would seem obvious that China would side with its longtime ally and former Communist comrade Russia. But how and why it is doing this goes deeper than their history. Last week, China's foreign minister Wang Yi called Russia's security concerns ""legitimate"", saying they should be ""taken seriously and addressed"". On Monday, Chinese ambassador to the UN Zhang Jun went further and said outright that China disagreed with US claims that Russia was threatening international peace. He also criticised the US for convening a meeting of the UN Security Council, likening it to ""megaphone diplomacy"" that was ""not conducive"" for negotiations. Couched in diplomatic speak, China's official line on the crisis has been cautious and nuanced, stopping short of actual support for Russia using military force against its former Soviet neighbour.  But some state media outlets covering the crisis have been blunter. Coming at a time of burgeoning anti-West sentiment in China, the Ukraine crisis has been portrayed as yet another example of the West's failures. In their view, it is the US-led Nato that is acting the bully in refusing to respect the sovereign right of other countries, such as Russia and China, to defend their territory. The Global Times newspaper claimed it was ""the ever closer relationship and bond between China and Russia [that is] the last defence that protects the world order"", while a report by state news agency Xinhua said the US was attempting to ""divert domestic attention"" and ""revive its influence over Europe"". Brookings Institution policy director Jessica Brandt notes that some of this rhetoric has been put out in multiple languages on Twitter (which is banned in China) - in an attempt to shape how the US and Nato are viewed by the rest of the world. ""I think the goal here is to undermine the soft power of the United States, to tarnish the credibility and appeal of liberal institutions, and to discredit open media,"" she tells the BBC, adding that this is an example of how Beijing ""regularly amplifies Kremlin talking points on Ukraine"" when it suits its interests.  China and Russia these days are close - perhaps closer than ever since the days of Stalin and Mao, some experts believe. The 2014 Crimea crisis in Ukraine was seen as pushing Russia further into the arms of China, which offered Moscow economic and diplomatic support amid international isolation.  Since then, the relationship has blossomed further. China has been Russia's biggest trade partner for years with bilateral trade hitting a new high of $147bn (£108bn) last year. The two countries also signed a roadmap for closer military ties last year while stepping up joint military exercises.  On Friday, Vladimir Putin wings his way to Beijing to attend the Winter Olympics at the invitation of Xi Jinping. There, the two will hold a closely-watched meeting that will make Mr Putin the first leader of a world power to meet Mr Xi in person in the last two years. The Chinese leader has refused to travel abroad and has met few foreigners since the start of the pandemic. Crucially though, both countries currently have particularly tense relationships with the West.  ""Beijing and Moscow perceive a shared interest in pushing back against the US and Europe and winning a bigger role for themselves in international politics,"" says Chris Miller, assistant professor of international history at Tufts University.  In the event of an escalated conflict that results in Western sanctions being imposed on Russia, experts believe China is likely to come to Russia's economic aid just as it has before. This could include providing alternative payment systems, loans for Russian banks and firms, more purchases of Russian oil, or even outright rejection of US export controls.    All this however would come at a significant financial cost to China - one reason why experts believe that, for now, echoing Moscow's line is as far as Beijing will go. ""Rhetorical support for Russia is a low-cost move for Beijing,"" says Dr Miller. A military conflict in Ukraine would result in a distracted US, which no doubt would be a boon for China. But many observers believe Beijing when it says it does not want war. China is seeking to stabilise relations with the US right now, points out Bonnie Glaser, director of the Asia programme at the German Marshall Fund. If Beijing lent stronger support to Moscow, that ""could create more tensions with the US, including a clearer democracy versus autocracy split,"" she tells the BBC.  Beijing is also likely ""hedging its bets"" in the crisis as it is wary of Moscow's true intentions, says political scientist Minxin Pei in a recent essay. Moreover, giving heavier support to Russia may antagonise the EU, China's second-largest trading partner, which may trigger a ""European backlash"".  Prof Pei argues this could possibly take the form of support for Taiwan - a concern that has cropped up on the sidelines of the Ukraine crisis. Some in the US, as well as Chinese communities around the world, are closely watching the Ukraine conflict as a potential test of US loyalties to its allies. Many are asking if the US would intervene militarily if Russia invades Ukraine - and if it would do the same if China one day attempts to reclaim Taiwan, an island that sees itself as an independent country and which counts the US as its biggest ally. The question of whether the US would go to war with China over Taiwan is a legitimate concern in Asia, as US-China rivalry heats up and as Taiwan increasingly reports Chinese warplane incursions in its self-declared air defence zone. The US has been deliberately vague about what it would actually do in the event of such an attack. It has a law that requires it to help Taiwan defend itself, but at the same time Washington diplomatically acknowledges the One China policy set out by Beijing, the position that there is only one Chinese government. Experts however have dismissed such parallels, pointing out that the two situations are governed by completely different geopolitical concerns. They point out that the US has far deeper historical ties with Taiwan and sees it as a linchpin of the US' ideological, diplomatic and military strategy for Asia.

The Guardian says Rishi Sunak's attempts to ""move on from the legacy of Boris Johnson's chaotic premiership have suffered a further setback"", after Scotland Yard said it was ""considering"" the video. The senior Tory MP, Tobias Ellwood, tells the online Independent that the prime minister should turn a ""mini crisis"" into a major opportunity beginning with ""an overhaul of his cabinet"". He also calls for him to be ""less fearful of right-wing backlash"". The front page of the Daily Mail features a plea in what it terms ""Britain's mortgage crisis"".  Experts in the paper urge the Bank of England to ""spare struggling households"" by pausing what is expected to be the 13th consecutive rise in interest rates. The Daily Telegraph predicts they will go up by a quarter of a percentage point on Thursday. But a Treasury source says any attempt to offer cash support to homeowners would be ""self-defeating"". The headline of the Daily Express says: ""Taxpayer will not foot bill for mortgage bailout"". The Times reports that the government is considering plans for British citizens to be prioritised for council housing. A source familiar with the proposal tells the paper migrants ""shouldn't be allowed to jump the queue"". But housing charity Shelter accuses ministers of ""scapegoating a group of people to distract"" from a shortage of social housing. According to the Sun, ministers will this week publish guidance banning schools in England from letting children change their gender if their parents object. It says teachers will be required to tell parents if their child is questioning their gender, and children who want to be called by another pronoun such as he, she or they will not be allowed to take part in competitive sport.

geopolitical tensions,Gold and silver hit record highs,2024-09-15,2011-04-25,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-13184951,"This video can not be played The price of gold has hit another record in Asia, hitting $1513.70 (£916.65) an ounce The prices of gold and silver have hit new record highs, driven by a weaker US dollar and continuing tensions in the Middle East and North Africa. Gold rose as high as $1,518.30 (£918.70) an ounce during morning trading in Europe, before falling back.  Silver briefly reached an all-time high of $49.79 an ounce before retreating to $46.91. Investors have been buying precious metals as a haven against inflation and recent geopolitical turmoil.   Analysts say gold could even trade even higher. ""We as a company believe that we may see $1,600 an ounce by the end of the year,"" said Angelos Damaskos, a fund manager at Sector Investments, which specialises in gold and oil investments. ""But gold could easily surprise everybody and go to significantly higher levels because of the relatively small supply of the metal."" Monday was the seventh consecutive trading session that saw the price of gold rise.  The price of gold has risen sixfold in the last 10 years, and has more than doubled since the global financial crisis of 2008. However, the price of silver has been even more volatile, having quintupled since 2008, and up 12-fold in the last decade. By mid-morning in London on Monday, silver was trading just below the high of $49.45 that it reached in 1980 following the Iranian revolution and related oil price spike. Much of the rise in both metals is seen as the flipside of a decline in the US dollar. ""It's the dollar play,"" said a Singapore-based dealer, referring to the gold rally. ""There is more room for prices to go even higher."" The greenback has been steadily declining against most other currencies since the end of the financial crisis. With the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, pumping unprecedented amounts into the financial markets, there are fears the dollar may lose its status as the favourite reserve currency of the world's central banks, with precious metals being an obvious alternative. On Wednesday, the Fed chairman, Ben Bernanke, is expected to affirm its commitment to quantitative easing, a programme to flood money markets with liquidity.  The policy tends to drive down the value of the US currency, and has been openly criticised by China and other countries who hold large dollar reserves. The prospect of low interest rates in the US is driving investors seeking higher returns towards gold. ""Investors expect the Fed to continue with low rates, which means the dollar could be even weaker, unless there were game-changing comments from Bernanke,"" said Ong Yin Ling of Phillip Futures. Investors continue to react nervously to the uncertainty in the Middle East. An escalation in violence in Yemen and Syria over the weekend has also helped the price of gold strengthen. However, an equally important driving factor in the rise of gold is its use in jewellery, particularly in India. Jewellery accounts for more than half of all gold usage, according to the World Gold Council, external. And in India, demand for gold jewellery has been skyrocketing, rising 69% last year. In contrast, silver's rally has been driven by its use in industry, particularly in electronics. With the global economic recovery, industrial demand for silver rose 21% last year, data from the Silver Institute showed, external. World Gold Council Silver Institute"
geopolitical tensions,Iranian tanker 'attacked' off Saudi coast,2024-09-15,2019-10-11,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-50011218,"An Iranian-owned oil tanker has been attacked in the Red Sea off the coast of Saudi Arabia, Iran's foreign ministry says. The ministry said the tanker Sabiti had been hit twice, causing some damage. Earlier Iran's national oil company (NIOC) said two explosions on the vessel had been caused ""likely by missiles"". But it dismissed earlier reports quoting it as saying the missiles were likely to have come from Saudi Arabia. In recent months ""other sabotage acts"" had been carried out against Iranian tankers in the Red Sea and these were being investigated, foreign ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi said. The incident took place at 04:50 (01:50 GMT) about 95km (60 miles) from the Saudi city of Jeddah, Iran's Mehr news agency said. Two of the vessel's tanks were struck, it added, causing damage measuring between 0.5m and 1.5m. There were no reports of injuries. The Sabiti is now sailing towards the Gulf, Mehr said. The reports have so far only come from Iranian sources. There has been no comment from Saudi officials. Iranian state TV earlier identified the vessel as the Sinopa, but the NIOC later said it was the Sabiti. Pictures allegedly taken on Friday aboard the Sabiti have been published by Iranian state TV, showing no visible signs of damage. Paul Adams, BBC Diplomatic Correspondent This story is as clear as mud. It seemed to change. Two different ships have been named - the Sinopa and the Sabiti. We had reports of missiles striking the tanker and then an accusation briefly levelled against Saudi Arabia for committing what was described as an ""act of terrorism"". That claim seems to have been dropped quite quickly.  And crucially there is no independent evidence at all that the vessel was struck. Pictures were released later in the morning showing nothing untoward. And most crucially both tankers are currently steaming at full speed in their different directions so there is no evidence that either vessel has been impaired in any way.  Publicly available ship tracking records show both ships are currently in the Red Sea. The Sinopa turned its transmitter on earlier this week for the first time in more than 50 days. The Sabiti, meanwhile, turned its tracker on early Friday after nearly 60 days of no transmissions. Under international regulations, all vessels above a certain tonnage must be fitted with the trackers, known as automatic identification systems (AIS). But ships are not required to have their AIS turned on all the time. A source at maritime analytics firm Windward told the BBC it was common for Iranian tankers to turn off AIS to avoid detection - often to evade international sanctions or harassment from Saudi Arabia.  Because of safety regulations, vessels must have their AIS switched on when they are close to the Suez Canal. The Windward source said Sabiti was behaving unusually because, when going through the canal, it only switches on its AIS when rules require - but in this instance, the AIS had been turned on hundreds of miles from the Suez after being ""dark"" for two months. Michelle Bockmann, an analyst at shipping newspaper Lloyds List, told the BBC that the tanker - whichever one it was - was ""probably"" carrying oil to Syria. ""That really is, along with China, the only market there is for Iranian crude now since the US tightened sanctions in May,"" said Ms Bockmann. ""We're seeing geopolitics playing out within the global shipping and tanker markets, and this is just an extension of the instability that we're seeing in the region."" The latest incident came amid heightened tension between Iran and Saudi Arabia in recent months. Last month, 18 drones and seven cruise missiles hit a major oil field and processing facility in Saudi Arabia, which blamed Iran for the attack. And US officials said Iran was responsible for attacks on two oil tankers in the Gulf in June and July, as well as attacks on another four tankers in May. Iran denied involvement in all the incidents. "
geopolitical tensions,US bars tech firms from building China factories,2024-09-15,2022-09-07,By Monica Miller,https://www.bbc.com/news/62803224,"US tech companies that receive federal funding will be barred from building ""advanced technology"" facilities in China for 10 years, the Biden administration has said.  The guidelines were unveiled as part of a $50bn (£43bn) plan aimed at building up the local semiconductor industry.  It comes as business groups have pushed for more government support in an effort to reduce reliance on China. They are faced with a global microchip shortage which has slowed production. ""We're going to be implementing the guardrails to ensure those who receive CHIPS funds cannot compromise national security... they're not allowed to use this money to invest in China, they can't develop leading-edge technologies in China.... for a period of ten years,"" according to US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo., explaining the US Chips and Science Act.  ""Companies who receive the money can only expand their mature node factories in China to serve the Chinese market."" The US and China are locked in a long-running dispute over trade and technology. In August, US President Joe Biden had signed a law committing $280bn (£232bn) to high tech manufacturing and scientific research, amid fears that the US is losing its technological edge to China.  The investments include tax breaks for companies that build computer chip manufacturing plants in the US. The US currently produces roughly 10% of the global supply of semiconductors, which are key to everything from cars to mobile phones, down from nearly 40% in 1990. The Chinese Embassy in Washington had opposed the semiconductor bill, calling it reminiscent of a ""Cold War mentality."" Some US chipmakers are already experiencing the impact of Washington's crackdown on selling US technology to China. Earlier this month, Nvidia and AMD were told by US officials to stop the sale of artificial intelligence chips to China.   Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities called the restrictions a ""gut punch"" for Nvidia.  ""This is really a shot across the bow at China and it's really going to fan those flames in terms of geopolitical (tensions),"" Mr Ives had told teh BBC. "
geopolitical tensions,SolarWinds: Why the Sunburst hack matters,2024-09-15,2020-12-16,By Joe Tidy,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-55321643,"We've all seen the pop-ups on our laptops or phones: ""Update is available, click here to download."" We're constantly urged to do as we're told because these software updates improve our apps by boosting cyber-security and removing glitches. So when, in the spring, a pop-up message hit the screens of IT staff using a popular piece of software called SolarWinds, around 18,000 workers in companies and governments diligently downloaded the update for their offices. What they couldn't have known was that the download was booby-trapped. SolarWinds itself didn't know either. The US company had been the victim of a cyber-attack weeks previously that had seen hackers inject a tiny piece of secret code into the company's next software update. After staying dormant for a couple of weeks, the powerful digital helper sprang to life inside thousands of computer networks in government, technology and telecom organisations across North America, Europe, Asia and the Middle East. The undetected digital agent then called home over the internet letting its creator know that it was inside and that it could hold the door open for them to enter too. For months the hackers, highly likely to be a national cyber-military team, could take their pick, spying on and stealing information, whizzing around thousands of different organisations. The most high-profile victim so far, which was also probably the prime target, is the US government. More US government agencies hacked US treasury and commerce departments hacked  Multiple office networks are reported to have been compromised including the treasury and commerce departments and Homeland Security. Governmental and private organisations around the world are now scrambling to disable the affected SolarWinds products from their systems. Researchers, who have named the hack Sunburst, say it could take years to fully comprehend one of the biggest ever cyber-attacks. Experts say the way the hackers gained entry to their victims is particularly concerning for national security. ""Governments are unequipped to compete with Silicon Valley and develop their own complex software suites in-house, thus the dependence on external supply chains which are increasingly becoming a target for hackers,"" said Jackie Singh, who was a lead cyber-security expert on the Joe Biden presidential campaign and founder of Spyglass Security.  ""If a group of well-funded hackers can succeed in modifying just a bit of code somewhere and getting folks to install it as part of a legitimate software suite, they are gaining insider access to organisations which may be otherwise impenetrable, such as governments."" There is no suggestion that supply chain attacks should put the general public off from accepting software updates, as this is an extremely rare case. However, Brian Lord, former deputy director of cyber-operations at UK intelligence agency GCHQ, agrees it is ""the underlying access tactic that is the most concerning issue"". The national intelligence side of the hack is also extremely worrying. According to Reuters, emails sent by officials at the Department of Homeland Security - which oversees border security and defence against hacking - were monitored by the hackers. Experts say the case highlights that government communications are vulnerable to the same hacks as private companies. Mr Lord, who now runs cyber-security company PGI, said: ""The victims here are key to our national and personal economic well-being, and protection is essential to allow us to function safely in a digital world. ""The fact the hackers can dance unopposed simultaneously into such a breadth of huge organisations through the same means should worry us. The spectrum of mischief and damage they can cause is both significant and global.""  Security teams in all affected organisations could take months trying to figure out which emails were read, documents stolen or passwords compromised in the hack. It's not known yet, and we may never be told, what sort of government information was stolen but Mr Lord says the most sensitive communications should still be safe. ""I think it is fair to say that the additional layers of security around top secret and highly classified stuff will be protected by internal controls, so direct access to those is unlikely."" The hackers probably didn't have the time or resources to carry out major surveillance on more than a small number of their possible victims, with government departments the most likely targets. Prof Alan Woodward, a cyber-security researcher at the University of Surrey, says: ""Post Cold War, this is one of the potentially largest penetrations of Western governments that I'm aware of. ""Just think about why countries conduct espionage. It's to give them an advantage, and that isn't necessarily just a military advantage, especially in peace time: use of intelligence in gaining economic advantage in all sorts of ways is a major aspect of why countries have intelligence-gathering operations. ""There is also the personal dimension. We saw that when the Office of Personnel Management was hacked in the US, the private details of many government employees were potentially accessed. These details are reserved for those who have undergone security vetting and are incredibly sensitive."" Prof Woodward, like many in the security world, says the attack has the hallmarks of a Russian operation, although this cannot yet be confirmed. Others, including researchers at FireEye, which discovered the hack after falling victim themselves, is pointing at a known Russian government team known as Cosy Bear. Russia's foreign ministry described the allegations as baseless, in a statement on Facebook. It could be months before we see a US response, but it's likely that if the US government does conclude it was Russia there could be geopolitical consequences. Cyber-attack responder Marina Krotofil, who used to work for FireEye, says the hack may increase tensions. ""In past years, the USA has imposed a series of sanctions on Russia, including the most recent indictment of the Russian military hackers. However, Russia explicitly demonstrates that they are not intimidated and are not going to slow down with their cyber-activities. This will further escalate relationships between the US and Russia and in the long run, and create severe political conflicts."" The 'Sunburst' hack may well represent a major salvo in the virtual skirmishes between rival nations - an escalation which could have serious consequences."

geopolitical tensions,Landmark Israel UAE trip signals deepening ties,2024-09-15,2021-06-28,By Sameer Hashmi,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-57530123,"The arrival of Israel's Foreign Minister, Yair Lapid, in the United Arab Emirates on Tuesday is a landmark moment for his country and the Arab world. Mr Lapid is the first Israeli minister to pay an official visit to the Gulf state since Israel, the UAE and Bahrain signed a historic deal to normalise ties nine months ago. During the two-day trip, Mr Lapid will meet his Emirati counterpart, Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, and inaugurate the Israeli embassy and consulate office in Abu Dhabi and Dubai respectively. The visit is important not only for its symbolic significance but also because it will be the first official engagement between the two sides since the Israel-Gaza conflict in May. At least 256 people were killed in Gaza, according to the UN, and 13 people were killed in Israel during the hostilities. The 11-day conflict was the first test for the newly forged relationship - especially given that the UAE leadership had billed the normalisation deal as an opportunity to halt Israel's plans to annex parts of the occupied West Bank, which were vehemently opposed by the Palestinians. In the lead-up to the fighting the UAE had condemned the potential eviction by Israel of Palestinians from homes contested by Jewish settlers in East Jerusalem - a focal point for rising Israel-Palestinian tensions - and had urged Israel to defuse the situation. During the hostilities, however, the UAE could do little to deploy diplomatic leverage to pressure the Jewish state to limit the scale of its attacks on Gaza, from where militants fired thousands of rockets. It is difficult to gauge public mood on contentious political issues in the UAE, an autocratic state, but anger was palpable on social media with citizens condemning Israeli action and showing support for Palestinians.  Despite this, Abdulkhaleq Abdullah, a Dubai-based political scientist, believes that Mr Lapid's historic visit shows that both countries have weathered the storm well.  ""The bilateral relationship has passed its first test, and it shows its irreversible,"" he says. ""The UAE is adopting two tracks: first is the normalisation path, and the second that it still supports the Palestinian right to have their own state."" Israel and the UAE had different objectives when they decided to normalise ties last year. From Abu Dhabi's perspective, security was at the heart of its decision, while for Israel, economic co-operation with the UAE - and acceptance by an Arab state - were the main drivers.  Shortly after the agreement, known as the Abraham Accords, was reached, then-US President Donald Trump's administration authorised the sale of 50 advanced F-35 fighter jets to the UAE. This was a huge shot in the arm for UAE, as the acquisition will not only beef up its military capabilities but also give it a strategic edge in the region. According to Bader Al-Saif, a Kuwait-based fellow with the Carnegie Middle East Center, the agreement with Israel reflects the UAE's long-term ambition of being an important geopolitical player on the global stage.  ""Through this deal, the UAE is betting on elevating its security stature in the region,"" he says. ""They have established themselves as an important economic hub but now they want to be one of main leaders in the Middle East."" The economic partnership has flourished since the accords were reached, with a flurry of business deals signed across multiple sectors, including healthcare, artificial intelligence, defence and travel.  In April, Abu Dhabi's sovereign wealth fund, Mubadala Investment, signed a memorandum of understanding to buy a stake in an Israeli natural gas field for as much as $1.1bn (£790m; €922m). If the deal goes through it will be the biggest between the two countries yet.  Data suggests that when it comes to trade ties, Israel has been the early winner.  According to Karen Young, director of the Economics and Energy Program at the Middle East Institute, the total value of investments from the UAE to Israel touched $80m between September 2020 and March 2021. During the same period, the capital inflow from Israel to the UAE amounted to less than $25m. Emirati investments into Israel have been led by state entities. Ms Young expects that trend to continue, especially after the recent Israel-Palestinian violence. ""What happened in May turned off a lot of private businesses in the UAE that may have been willing to go into Israel as investors,"" she says. But even as private investments from the UAE are expected to remain subdued, Ms Young thinks that investments by state entities - specifically in technology, defence, water and food - will continue as these sectors are a priority for the UAE government.   ""There were going to be obvious difficulties in pursuing this relationship, including opening up investment ties, but they will hold firm because the UAE government is strongly committed to seeing this through,"" she says.

geopolitical tensions,Tense US-China meeting deepens balloon row,2024-09-15,2023-02-17,By Tessa Wong,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-64673926,"As the rift between the US and China over the balloon saga widens, so has the divide within the global community scrutinising their high-stakes dispute. The latest testy exchange took place on Saturday, when US Secretary of State Antony Blinken met China's top diplomat Wang Yi on the sidelines of a security conference in Munich, in the first high-level meeting since the row began. Mr Blinken said they would not ""stand for any violation of our sovereignty"" and said ""this irresponsible act must never again occur"". Mr Wang, meanwhile, called the episode a ""political farce manufactured by the US"" and accused them of ""using all means to block and suppress China"". China continues to deny that they sent a spy balloon, even as the US continues to disclose more details of the object to back up their allegation.  But beyond the dispute, the way both Beijing and Washington have responded to each other has come under close examination as the world grapples with the incident's implications for national security and geopolitical stability. The net result, say observers, is that it has hardened positions - deepening distrust among those wary of China or the US - and made it significantly harder for Washington and Beijing to close the gap between them. For some, the incident has heightened anxieties over the reach of Chinese espionage, as governments scramble to reassess what they know of China's surveillance capabilities. The US claims Chinese military balloons have crossed the airspace of more than 40 countries across five continents. This week Japan - a key US ally - announced that after they had re-analysed past cases of unidentified flying objects, they ""strongly suspect"" that China had flown at least three spy balloons across their territory since 2019. A Financial Times report quoted unnamed Taiwanese officials saying the island - another US ally, and one that is claimed by China - had been spied on by dozens of Chinese military balloons.  Taiwan's defence ministry later clarified it had only spotted Chinese weather balloons - on Friday it found the remnants of one such object - but also warned they would not hesitate to shoot down any suspected military objects in its airspace.  ""For other states, they didn't know what to make of it previously, but now they do. So it shows a gap in understanding on the part of other states, and not surprisingly China has sought to exploit the gap,"" said Dr Ian Chong, a non-resident scholar at Carnegie China. For those convinced of the US allegations, the incident has highlighted an underestimation of China's surveillance capability - and the lengths Beijing would go to prove it.  ""It certainly indicates the People's Liberation Army feels they can justify absolutely any technology and any mission, that they can do anything to increase China's ability to project power, conduct surveillance, and hold the US at risk,"" said Mr Drew Thompson, a former US Department of Defense official and a visiting senior research fellow at the National University of Singapore. This, said Mr Thompson, was done ""regardless of the consequences to China's reputation, its obligation and adherence to international law, and without considering the benefits of acting with restraint"". Noting there has been a lack of a concerted outcry and pushback from the global community, Mr Thompson said this demonstrated ""a fragility of international law"" and was a ""testament to China's ability to deter other countries from criticising them"", and could lead to a more unsafe world. Beijing undermined its own attempts to win trust and project the image of a responsible superpower with the way it has responded in the saga, according to some observers. China has yet to divulge details backing up its claim that the balloon was a civilian meteorological airship, such as the name of the company that operated it. ""This lack of transparency has only created more questions, and has given those who are already sceptical a reason to be even more so,"" said Dr Chong. Beijing's subsequent claim that the US has in the past flown more than 10 spy balloons into China - which Washington has denied - was also ""confusing"", he added. ""Is China suggesting that floating lots of balloons over each other's territory has been an accepted practice?"" asked Dr Chong, who pointed out that if this were the case, it would contradict Beijing's long-held insistence on the respect for sovereignty. The claim could be seen as a case of China deflecting and engaging in ""whataboutism"", said Mr Thompson, which is a way of responding to an accusation by proffering a counter-accusation. But the way the US has reacted has also unnerved some, particularly those who side with China. This week, US officials admitted that three other objects they shot out of the sky in North America were not likely foreign spy crafts. US President Joe Biden defended the decision as necessary to protect commercial air traffic, and also because at that time they ""could not rule out the surveillance risk of sensitive facilities"". Victor Gao, vice-president of Beijing-based think tank Center for China and Globalization, called the shootings an ""overreaction"" that could be seen as the US ""acting increasingly hysterical"".  ""China has been very professional and responsible, explaining the situation to the US and the whole world and asking for co-operation rather than confrontation. This is in contrast to the jingoism of the US - they should remember they are not shooting buffalo in the Wild West, they are shooting down an object that China owns,"" he said. Others have praised the US' handling of the incident, with Australia's deputy PM Richard Marles calling the shootdown of the Chinese balloon ""a very measured way"" of responding to the incursion. With both sides doubling down, what is clear is that the balloon blow-up has made reconciliation even harder. For the Chinese, the shootdown and Mr Biden's refusal to apologise has set a precedent, warned Mr Gao. ""They would need to be prepared for similar acts of retaliation against similar objects in Chinese space… Don't complain that China doesn't apologise, if such an unfortunate incident happens again,"" he said. He pointed out that it may even push China to take a stronger stance against US planes and ships in airspace and waters which China considers as theirs, such as Taiwan.  The US Navy routinely conducts what it calls ""freedom of navigation"" exercises by sailing its military ships through the Taiwan Strait. But there are signs of a willingness to engage. Mr Biden said he plans on calling Chinese president Xi Jinping soon to discuss the incident. Both leaders face domestic pressure to not be seen as backing down. As the balloon saga drifts on, the question now is how much political capital both leaders would be willing to spend to deflate tensions."
geopolitical tensions,The paradise islands caught in the US-China crosshairs,2024-09-15,2023-04-26,By Laura Bicker,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-65370413,"The largest ever military exercises between the United States and the Philippines are drawing to a close. They began just days after China's military rehearsed a blockade of Taiwan - a display the US called disproportionate. With tensions high in the region, a handful of people on a few small islands find themselves caught between two superpowers. Life is fragile in Itbayat.  The steep limestone cliffs and rolling hills that make up this tiny island on the northern edge of the Philippines rise out of the Luzon Strait.  Even on a good day, strong waves on the azure seas toss around tiny fishing boats hoping to hook some of the islanders' favourite flying fish. Nearly 3,000 native Ivatans, fishermen and farmers, have survived here in the face of earthquakes, typhoons and drought. But now they face a new and different threat. Their island home risks being caught in a conflict between the United States and China as the two militaries skirt ever closer to each other to gain the upper hand in the South China Sea.  At the heart of the issue is Taiwan. China's claims over the self-governing island are growing louder even as the US' commitment to defend it appears to be deepening. And these islands - Itbayat and Basco - that make up the far-flung Philippine archipelago of Batanes are in the line of crossfire.  They appear as mere dots in the ocean that surrounds them. But their proximity to Taiwan - it's just 156km (96 miles) from Itbayat - has made them both strategic allies and vulnerable foes.  Analysts often talk of rising tensions between the two superpowers, but what is it like to live in the biggest flashpoint between Beijing and Washington?   Itbayat can often be cut off for weeks. It certainly looks impenetrable. Small ports are carved out of the cliffs and getting to a boat involves clambering down steep steps cut into the rock face. The colour of the water hugging the land is a deep turquoise - and so clear you can watch small fish play amongst the coral. Itbayat feels untouched by man, other than the indigenous community who've made it their home. Few here have televisions. A network of relayed messages from house to house, or through the church congregation is often more reliable than the patchy phone signal.  But they don't need TV news or social media to tell them about the turbulent relationship between the US and China which threatens their shores.  It's closer than it has ever been. Crouched down, eyes fixed through the viewfinders of their weapons and head to toe in camouflage are the members of the US Army's 25th Infantry Division training on the island of Basco. They were practising to defend the island from potential aggressors. The exercise was part of the largest combat drills ever held between the US and the Philippines. Out at sea, the mission was controlled from the USS Miguel Keith, a naval ship, while V-22 Osprey aircraft hovered over the island, much to the amazement of locals who grabbed their mobile phones to film. The simulation even involved rocket launchers being shipped to the beaches using amphibious landing craft. ""The goal of our campaign in this region is to deter conflict from ever occurring,"" says Major General Joseph Ryan, the commanding general of the 25th Infantry Division. ""We don't want a war with the PRC [People's Republic of China]. We do not want that, we do not desire that and we are not provoking that. A war with the PRC is good for nobody."" But, he admits, the two forces are sending a message. ""The message sent is we're ready, we're capable, we're prepared. We've got a great partnership here. And we mean business."" The two sides are certainly arming themselves; as is the whole of Asia.  China is still the region's biggest spender on new military hardware, with this year's defence budget the highest it's ever been, around $224bn.   The US, in turn, has been keen to show off its capabilities, holding ever more military drills with allies throughout the region, including Japan, South Korea and Australia.  For Washington this is not just about a display of shiny new arms. It is also about shoring up alliances - the White House has been dispatching envoys more often than usual to Asia, hoping to stitch together a sturdy coalition to counter China. And that includes the Philippines, whose location is an asset.  ""The situation is heating up,"" admitted Filipino President Ferdinand Marcos in a recent interview with a local radio station ahead of his visit to Washington this week. He has decided to take a more assertive approach to China than his predecessor and that includes ordering more patrols by the Navy and the Coastguard. But what would be largely uneventful patrols elsewhere have the potential to turn into a conflict in the South China Sea, where even fishing could ignite a geopolitical crisis.  Beijing claims sovereignty over almost the entire South China Sea - a strategic waterway through which trillions of dollars in trade passes annually - despite an international court ruling that the assertion has no legal basis. ""The Chinese fishermen used to harass us,"" says 59-year-old Cyrus Malupa, as he casts a single wire line with a metal hook into the sea.  ""But when we reported that to the government, it placed a military base on Mavulis Island to the north. Now we have Philippine Marines there on duty,"" he adds.  In March, the Navy started a month-long mission on the uninhabited island, described it as the country's ""first line of defence"" and raised the Filipino flag on its highest peak. A small but bold act of sovereignty. For Cyrus and others who live in tiny boats for days in the hope of catching enough tuna to sell at the local market, the geopolitical dispute is personal. It's about feeding their families. Hundreds of Filipino fishermen have reported incidents of being driven away from their traditional fishing grounds in the South China Sea for more than a decade - particularly in the contested seas near the Spratly Islands. ""We don't have that much catch because the poachers have more advanced technology,"" Cyrus says as the tiny boat bounces over the white horses now forming on the water. ""Us locals use the old way of fishing like lines and smaller nets. But the poachers have more advanced technology so they can catch as much as they can."" Manila has filed nearly 200 diplomatic protests against Beijing's actions in the South China Sea - where Vietnam, Malaysia, Taiwan and Brunei also have overlapping territorial claims. It's natural to be worried because any conflict will affect our lives,"" said 51-year-old Victor Gonzales.  ""First, we are afraid for our lives and then there is the possible exodus of people coming here from Taiwan as we have limited resources."" Like most on Itbayat, Victor farms when the sea is rough and goes out to fish when it is fair. Crops are raised by hand, with no help from machinery or fertilisers. Instead, farmers rotate sweet potato, rice, corn, garlic and onions. A single farm can feed around 25 families. ""We need to protect our resources because it's how we live, and we don't have any alternative. We want to have something to pass onto the next generation,"" Victor says.   The concern runs deep enough that leaders of local governments in the Batanes islands announced to reporters last December that they would secure food supplies to prepare for a possible conflict.   The restricted signs around the Camilo Osias naval base on the beaches of Santa Ana are hand-painted and difficult to make out - almost obscured by the dozens of green fishing boats moored along the sand. It's Sunday and a few of the men who would usually be at sea are getting tipsy in the shade on a Filipino brand of gin.  A handful of water buffalo wallow in the shallows flicking off the birds that come to rest on their backs with their tails. Nearby, women are doing the weekly washing in huge tubs - the suds spilling over the sides. Santa Ana is a sleepy town on the northern tip of the main island of Luzon. There is little activity around the tiny Filipino naval base which is so tucked away on a corner of the beach that you would barely know it was there - unless you spotted the ""restricted"" signs. Crucially it has an airstrip that will give the US access to the Taiwan Strait. ""It's not really a base. I would say it is more like a Boy Scout camp,"" exclaims Cagayan Governor Manuel Mamba. This is one of the four new bases in the Philippines that US troops can access as the two countries boost their military alliance. Two of the new locations are in the northern province of Cagayan and face Taiwan. ""This is not my call or the call of our people. It's the call of our national leaders. We will abide by it. We may disagree with it, but really it's all because we don't want war,"" says Mr Mamba. ""We are poor, and we have our local problems too. That is why any cause of uncertainty will be a bigger problem for all of us."" Mr Mamba is worried that having two US bases in his province will make it a target. He had hoped to bring Chinese tourists to the region, or build a new international airport. Now he fears that Beijing may snub the Philippines when it needs their business more than ever. ""It is hard for us to choose between the two of them. Between a neighbour who has never been our enemy and an ally who has stood by us through so many difficulties. If they could be together, if only they could talk, if only there was middle ground for them to meet."" Governor Mamba's comments reflect a growing anxiety across parts of Asia. Will they be forced to choose between a long standing ally, the US, and their largest trade partner, China?  Back in Basco, in the capital of the tiny Philippine province of the Batanes islands, 21-year-old Ave Marie Garcia is helping travellers get flights to and from her home island of Itbayat. She doesn't keep an eye on the news - but she couldn't fail to notice or hear about the latest military exercises.  ""I don't think the US is going to cause war with these military exercises. It's just the US is trying to help the Philippine military to protect this island and to let the Chinese know that this region is protected,"" she says as she jumps on her scooter to show us her favourite views and beaches. Ave is one of 11 children and like many in the Philippines, her mother works abroad to send money back to the family. Their ancestral home, a traditional stone cottage which has stood through the centuries, lies in ruins after an earthquake in 2019 - a reminder that life is fragile here. Ave and her siblings were brought up by what she describes as her strict grandmother. But in Ave there are small signs of rebellion. Her long dark hair is dip-dyed blonde at the ends. And yet, she is an Ivatan at heart. Her hope is to preserve her ancestors' way of life, even if that means saying no to the United States. She believes there should be limits. ""I am worried about the future - for our future. I hope they won't build structures here for the U.S military, I just want to leave it as it is. They are allowed to visit this place but they are not allowed to build something here that will cause anyone to invade us. For me it's scary."" The people here feel miles away from the politics and the bellicose rhetoric, and they try not to dwell on what could be, and enjoy what they have. ""An island life is a simple life,"" Ave says. Each day, she and her family pray it will stay that way."
geopolitical tensions,Turkish lira sinks amid Erdogan fury with allies,2024-09-15,2020-10-27,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-54705617,"The Turkish lira has hit a record low of 8.15 against the dollar amid investor anxiety about the Turkish economy, hit by coronavirus and friction with Nato allies. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has riled France and the US among others. Analysts attribute the weakening to concern about Turkish inflation - 11.7% last month - and the central bank's refusal to raise its key interest rate. A rate rise could dampen inflation and encourage investors to buy lira. President Erdogan's regional muscle-flexing - in Libya, Syria, around Cyprus and in the Caucasus - has disconcerted investors, market analysts say. ""The rising geopolitical tensions with the USA and EU are new sources of pressure weakening the lira,"" said a Turkish foreign exchange trader quoted by Reuters news agency.  Piotr Matys, an analyst at Rabobank, said there were concerns that a win for US presidential candidate Joe Biden could mean ""severe sanctions on Turkey for purchasing the Russian S-400 [anti-aircraft] defence system"" and ""the market is also concerned about [the] rapidly deteriorating relationship between Turkey and France"". The lira has lost 26% of its value this year and the Turkish authorities are reported to have spent about $134bn (£103bn) in the past 18 months propping up the currency. On 23 October President Erdogan confirmed that Turkey had tested the controversial S-400 missile system. Then on Sunday he hit back at US criticism over the arms deal with Russia, saying: ""You do not know who you are playing with. Go ahead with your sanctions."" The US state department has warned of ""potential serious consequences for our security relationship if Turkey activates the system"". The EU is by far the largest of Turkey's trading partners. But this month EU leaders issued a sharp warning to Mr Erdogan over Turkish exploration for gas off Cyprus.  A summit statement said the EU ""deplores renewed unilateral and provocative actions by Turkey in the Eastern Mediterranean, including recent exploratory activities"". Greece and Cyprus remain bitterly opposed to Turkey over breakaway, Turkish-controlled northern Cyprus. French President Emmanuel Macron has been especially critical of Turkey's activities there. On Sunday Mr Erdogan accused him of mistreating French Muslims and then he joined calls in the Arab world for a boycott of French goods. Mr Macron has launched a crackdown on Islamist extremism in France. Coronavirus is also taking a toll on the Turkish economy - after getting over the worst of the outbreak in spring and bringing daily cases below 1,000, Turkey is seeing rising infections, like its European neighbours. The central bank's unexpected decision to keep interest rates on hold last week was aimed at stimulating short-term credit growth, Enis Senerdem of BBC Turkish reports. But President Erdogan is also a vocal opponent of high interest rates and many Turkey watchers believe that his influence weighs heavily on central bank rate decisions, Senerdem says.  Selling billions of dollars to defend the lira has depleted Turkey's foreign exchange reserves. The economy is expected to contract sharply this year. Even Mr Erdogan's warming towards Russia - another big trading partner - has cooled significantly because of geopolitical rivalry. They are backing opposing sides in Libya and Syria and Mr Erdogan is backing Azerbaijan in its war to retake Armenian-controlled Nagorno-Karabakh."
geopolitical tensions,What is Vladimir Putin planning?,2024-09-15,2021-12-20,By Steve Rosenberg,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-59730522,"When a former KGB officer became Russia's president more than two decades ago, the one question everyone in the West seemed to be asking was: ""Who is Mr Putin?"" Today the question has changed to: ""What is Mr Putin planning?""  The tens of thousands of Russian troops deployed near Ukraine's border; the increasing anti-Western rhetoric in Moscow; a Russian diplomatic initiative that looks more like an ultimatum to the West than a serious negotiation: are these preparations for a large-scale Russian military operation? An invasion of Ukraine? Is this a prelude to war? Like most foreign journalists in Moscow, I have a telephone number for the Kremlin press office. What I don't have is a direct line into the mind of Vladimir Putin.  Only he, perhaps, knows what the plan is and, right now, at home and abroad, he's keeping everyone guessing. But some things are clear.  This week marks 30 years since the dissolution of the Soviet Union. President Putin once described that as ""the greatest geopolitical tragedy of the 20th Century."" He remains deeply resentful of how the Cold War ended: with Moscow losing territory, influence and empire. ""What was the break-up of the USSR? It was the break-up of historical Russia,"" Mr Putin said in a recent state TV documentary. ""We lost 40% of our territory… much of what had been accumulated over 1,000 years was lost."" The Kremlin resents, too, Nato's post-Cold War enlargement to the east. Moscow accuses the West of breaking verbal promises that the alliance would not expand into Eastern Europe and the former Soviet space. Nato insists no such promises were given.  Can Russia undo what is done? It appears to be trying. Last week, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov unveiled draft security agreements that Moscow wants America to sign. They would provide a legally binding guarantee that Nato will give up military activity in Eastern Europe and Ukraine.  The proposals would appear to prohibit Nato deployments to countries that joined the alliance after 1997. Russia is also demanding an end to Nato enlargement in former Soviet territory.  In an online briefing, I suggested to Mr Ryabkov that what Russia is proposing is a ""complete reassessment of the results of the Cold War"". ""I wouldn't call it a re-examination of the results of the Cold War,"" he replied. ""I would say we're re-evaluating the expansion the West has carried out in recent years against Russian interests. This has been done in different ways, using various resources, with hostile intent. Enough is enough."" Nato - a defensive alliance - denies it has any ""hostile intent"" towards Russia.  As for ""enough is enough"", Western governments say just that about the Kremlin's behaviour. Moscow's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and its military intervention in eastern Ukraine triggered Western sanctions and an image of Vladimir Putin's Russia as an aggressor. It is why the Russian troop build-up near Ukraine is causing such concern. What happens if Russia fails to receive the security guarantees it is demanding? ""We'll deploy missiles. But this is your choice. We don't want this,"" says Dmitry Kiselev, who presents the most popular news show on Russian state TV and plays a key role in spreading the Kremlin's message to the public.  Mr Kiselev, who is under Western sanctions, also heads the giant state media holding Rossiya Segodnya. ""If Ukraine ever joins Nato or if Nato develops military infrastructure there, we will hold a gun to America's head. We have the military capability.  ""Russia has the best weapons in the world - hypersonic ones. They'd reach America as fast as US or British weapons could reach Moscow from Ukraine. It would be the Cuban missile crisis all over again, but with a shorter flight time for the missiles."" ""Is Russia prepared to use force to defend its red lines?"" I ask Mr Kiselev. ""One hundred percent, because for Russia this is a question of life or death.""  ""But Russia is dictating to its neighbours,"" I continue. ""You're saying that Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Moldova, all former Soviet republics can't have anything to do with Nato?""  ""Countries are either lucky or they're unlucky to be next to Russia. That's the historical reality. They can't change that. It's the same as Mexico. It's either lucky or not to be close to America,"" Mr Kiselev says. ""It would be good to harmonise our interests and not put Russia in a position where missiles could reach us in four minutes,"" he adds. ""Russia is ready to create a comparable, analogous threat, by deploying its weapons close to decision-making centres. But we are suggesting a way of avoiding this, of not creating threats. Otherwise, everyone will be turned into radioactive ash.""  So, is the Russian troop build-up near Ukraine coercive diplomacy? Is the Kremlin's aim to extract concessions and security guarantees from Washington without the need for war? If so, it is a high-stakes approach.  ""There is a real danger of an inadvertent escalation, be it in the Donbas, along the Russian-Ukrainian border, or maybe in the Black Sea,"" says Andrei Kortunov, director general of the Russian International Affairs Council, a think tank linked to the Russian authorities. ""If you have tensions, if you have this very poisonous political atmosphere, if you have a lot of military activities, on the ground, in the air, the sea, there are risks something goes wrong. This could lead to a conflict no-one really wants."" And if there is a major conflict? The annexation of Crimea proved popular with the Russian public. But Russians have little appetite for a full-scale war with Ukraine or military confrontation with the West.  ""I don't think that Russians are focused now on foreign policy success stories, real or imaginary,"" says Mr Kortunov. ""The agenda is mostly domestic and the real concerns of Russians are connected to social and economic problems. I don't think Putin is in a position to get a couple of additional points if he starts an operation abroad."""

geopolitical tensions,Trump reacts with fury at Fed chief's speech,2024-09-15,2019-08-23,By Russell Hotten,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-49452366,"Donald Trump reacted furiously on Friday after the head of the US central bank spoke about the economic risks of a trade war with China. The president asked if Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell was a greater ""enemy"" than China's leader Xi Jinping. It followed a speech in which Mr Powell said trade tensions were hitting the global economy and the Fed didn't have a ""rulebook"" to deal with the fallout. On Friday, China imposed new tariffs, with Mr Trump promising retaliation. Mr Powell was giving a keynote speech at the annual convention for central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Although he said the US economy was in a ""favourable place"" he listed a series of economic and geopolitical risks linked to Mr Trump's trade war with China. There are ""no recent precedents to guide any policy response to the current situation,"" Mr Powell said, adding that monetary policy ""cannot provide a settled rulebook for international trade"". The Fed chief has been under pressure from Mr Trump for a deep cut in interest rates, and has faced a series of derogatory Twitter posts from the president. But Friday's attacks were among the most critical. ""As usual, the Fed did NOTHING! It is incredible that they can 'speak' without knowing or asking what I am doing, which will be announced shortly,"" Mr Trump wrote on Twitter. ""We have a very strong dollar and a very weak Fed. I will work 'brilliantly' with both, and the US will do great."" In another tweet, he said: ""My only question is, who is our bigger enemy, Jay Powel or Chairman Xi?"" China said on Friday it would impose retaliatory tariffs against about $75bn worth of US goods, putting as much as an extra 10% on top of existing rates in the dispute between the world's top two economies. Mr Trump indicated he was planning retaliation, but it was unclear what that would be. The president said in a subsequent Twitter post that he would respond to China's tariffs later on Friday. Wall Street share markets dived on the escalating tensions, with the three main indexes down between 1.7% and 2% in late morning trading.    Some analysts think Mr Trump has been ratcheting up his criticism of Mr Powell so he can blame the fed chair if the US economy goes into downturn. Karen Petrou, managing partner of Federal Financial Analytics, told the BBC earlier this week: ""Mr Trump doesn't care what rates are. He cares about who voters think is to blame for slower growth and market turmoil, and he is determined to be sure it isn't him,"" she said.  ""What's an astute politician to do? Find a fall guy distrusted by Republicans, Democrats, independents, populists, and progressives.""         "
geopolitical tensions,India's fabled neutrality under strain over Ukraine,2024-09-15,2022-03-25,By Soutik Biswas,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-60857406,"On Monday, US President Joe Biden told a meeting of business leaders in Washington that among the so-called Quad group of nations, India was being ""somewhat shaky"" in its response to Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine. The US, Japan and Australia - the three other members of this coalition formed to counter China's influence - have been ""extremely strong in terms of dealing with Putin's aggression"", he said. India, however, has doggedly pursued a non-aligned foreign policy since independence, where, according to the first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru, ""we will stay away from the big blocs…to be friendly to all countries…not join any alliance.""  But will the war in Ukraine now put India's fabled neutrality under strain? ""India is feeling the heat, no doubt about it,"" Michael Kugelman, deputy director of the Asia Program at the Wilson Center, a Washington-based think tank, says.  ""Fence-sitting is a bigger diplomatic gamble now than in the past, given that Russia's invasion of Ukraine is one of the worst aggressions in decades and India's relations with the West have never been stronger."" India has abstained from voting in the United Nations - three times in a week - on resolutions condemning Russia. There have been reports of a surge of Indian imports of discounted Russian oil as energy prices spiked in the wake of the war. And it has pointedly stopped short of criticising Russia which it has called a ""longstanding and time-tested friend in the past. The two countries share a decades-old relationship harking back to the Cold War, and Russia is also India's biggest defence supplier.  The US is now trying to persuade India that things have changed. For one, the relationship between the two countries has deepened - bilateral trade between India and the US is $150bn, compared to $8bn between India and Russia.   US Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland visited Delhi this week, and had, in her own words, ""broad and deep conversations"" with Indian Foreign Minister S Jaishankar and senior officials. She acknowledged the historical relationship between India and Russia, but said ""times have changed now"" and there was ""an evolution of thinking in India"". Ms Nuland told journalists that the US and Europe were willing to be strong ""defence and security partners"" of India. She said US could help wean India off its dependence on Russian defence supplies. The war was a ""major inflection point in the ""autocratic-democratic struggle"" in which India's support was needed, she noted.   Such an explicit message from the US, Mr Kugelman says, ""may well be uncharted territory"".   But Indian experts are loathe to believe that the country is under diplomatic pressure. They point to the fact that other Quad members have been sympathetic to India and that the US itself had acknowledged India's humanitarian assistance to Ukraine. ""If there's one country which is isolated in the Quad, it's not India, it's the US,"" says former Indian diplomat Jitendra Nath Misra.  And weakening a strategic partner through sanctions - for buying Russian arms or oil - doesn't benefit the US, which wants India to play counterweight to China in the Indo-Pacific.  At the same time, India's close ties with Russia do not mean that it has been aloof to the crisis in Ukraine, experts say.  They point to the joint statement issued last week by Mr Modi and his Japanese counterpart Fumio Kishida during the latter's visit to Delhi: the two leaders expressed their ""serious concern about the ongoing conflict and humanitarian crisis in Ukraine"". They also ""emphasised that the contemporary global order has been built on the UN Charter, international law and respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity of states"".  Mr Modi has spoken to both President Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky urging them to end the violence. His government managed to get more than 22,000 Indians out of Ukraine in 90 evacuation flights. Former diplomat Anil Triguniyat, who served in Moscow, says President Biden's remark that India's response was ""shaky"" was ""possibly a joke of some kind"". ""India's position has been consistent and principled all through. India has stood for diplomacy, dialogue, respecting territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine,"" he says. ""We have to be strategically neutral. There's no other way.""  Happymon Jacob, a professor of foreign policy at Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University, believes that the ""heat hasn't really increased on India and it is managing the contradictions quite well"".  ""The question is whether India could have done more,"" he says. The jury is out on this.  Although India had managed the crisis admirably, it should have called a ""spade a spade… It is an invasion, it is a war,"" India's former foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon told The Wire. It ""affects your credibility if you don't"", he added. But Delhi's special relationship with Moscow - ""fraught with nostalgia and deep trust"", as Mr Kugelman describes it - means that it won't easily turn against its ally.  ""These sentiments die hard, even after Russia has launched a massive, cold-blooded invasion. But at the same time India doesn't want to alienate its ties with the West"".  One way to avoid alienation, say experts, is for India to offer itself as a third-party mediator - something which Ukraine's Ambassador to India, Igor Polikha, had urged at the beginning of the war.  ""India can leverage its deep ties to Moscow and cordial relations with Kyiv and try to push both sides to de-escalate,"" Mr Kugelman says. ""To be sure, Putin might be undeterrable. But if Delhi is at least making an effort to bring about de-escalation, that should pre-empt potential tensions with the West over India's refusal to take the West's side."" Mr Jacob echoes the sentiment, saying when Ukrainians asked for mediation, India could have taken up the offer. ""India still has the opportunity. It should still go ahead and offer itself as a neutral mediator."" After all, India needs both US and Russia on its side to help manage its fraught relationship with China. Last year, the two neighbours faced off against each other along their disputed border in the Himalayan region.  In the long term, Mr Triguniyat says, India should pursue a policy of strategic autonomy - not far removed from non-alignment -and initiate a grouping of ""nations for strategic unity"" to serve their development interests in a ""much more severe Cold War 2.0"" that is likely to emerge after the war in Ukraine. Former Indian foreign secretary Shyam Saran has said the ""nightmare scenario"" for India would be if ""the US comes to the conclusion that it confronts a greater threat from Russia and that this justifies a strategic accommodation with China"". Bluntly this means, ""concede Chinese dominance in Asia, while safeguarding its European flank.""  That's a ""nightmare"" India will never get used to. "
geopolitical tensions,Drone strikes set Saudi oil facilities ablaze,2024-09-15,2019-09-14,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-49699429,"Drone attacks have set alight two major oil facilities run by the state-owned company Aramco in Saudi Arabia, state media say. Footage showed a huge blaze at Abqaiq, site of Aramco's largest oil processing plant, while a second drone attack started fires in the Khurais oilfield. The fires are now under control at both facilities, state media said. A spokesman for the Iran-aligned Houthi group in Yemen said it had deployed 10 drones in the attacks. The military spokesman, Yahya Sarea, told al-Masirah TV, which is owned by the Houthi movement and is based in Beirut, that further attacks could be expected in the future. He said Saturday's attack was one of the biggest operations the Houthi forces had undertaken inside Saudi Arabia and was carried out in ""co-operation with the honourable people inside the kingdom"". Saudi Arabia is said to be shutting down around half of its oil output, the Wall Street Journal reports.  Officials have not yet commented on who they think is behind the attacks.  ""At 04:00 (01:00 GMT), the industrial security teams of Aramco started dealing with fires at two of its facilities in Abqaiq and Khurais as a result of... drones,"" the official Saudi Press Agency reported. ""The two fires have been controlled."" There have been no details on the damage but Agence France-Presse quoted interior ministry spokesman Mansour al-Turki as saying there were no casualties. Abqaiq is about 60km (37 miles) south-west of Dhahran in Saudi Arabia's Eastern Province, while Khurais, some 200km further south-west, has the country's second largest oilfield. Saudi security forces foiled an attempt by al-Qaeda to attack the Abqaiq facility with suicide bombers in 2006. Jonathan Marcus, BBC defence and diplomatic correspondent This latest attack underlines the strategic threat posed by the Houthis to Saudi Arabia's oil installations. The growing sophistication of the Houthis' drone operations is bound to renew the debate as to where this capability comes from. Have the Houthis simply weaponised commercial civilian drones or have they had significant assistance from Iran? The Trump administration is likely to point the finger squarely at Tehran, but experts vary in the extent to which they think Iran is facilitating the drone campaign. The Saudi Air Force has been pummelling targets in Yemen for years. Now the Houthis have a capable, if much more limited, ability to strike back. It shows that the era of armed drone operations being restricted to a handful of major nations is now over. Drone technology - albeit of varying degrees of sophistication - is available to all; from the US to  China, Israel and Iran... and from the Houthis to Hezbolllah. Analysis by BBC business correspondent Katie Prescott Aramco ranks as the world's largest oil business and these facilities are significant.  The Khurais oilfield produces about 1% of the world's oil and Abqaiq is the company's largest facility - with the capacity to process 7% of the global supply. Even a brief or partial disruption could affect the company, and the oil supply, given their size. But whether this will have an impact on the oil price come Monday will depend on just how extensive the damage is. Markets now have the weekend to digest information from Aramco and assess the long-term impact. According to Richard Mallinson, geopolitical analyst at Energy Aspects, any reaction on Monday morning is likely to be muted, as markets are less worried about supply than demand at the moment, due to slower global economic growth and the ongoing trade war between the US and China. However, there are concerns that escalating tensions in the region could pose a broader risk, potentially threatening the fifth of the world's oil supply that goes through the critical Strait of Hormuz. The Iran-aligned Houthi rebel movement has been fighting the Yemeni government and a Saudi-led coalition. Yemen has been at war since 2015, when President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi was forced to flee the capital Sanaa by the Houthis. Saudi Arabia backs President Hadi, and has led a coalition of regional countries against the rebels. The coalition launches air strikes almost every day, while the Houthis often fire missiles into Saudi Arabia. Mr Sarea, the Houthi group's military spokesman, told al-Masirah that operations against Saudi targets would ""only grow wider and will be more painful than before, so long as their aggression and blockade continues"". Houthi fighters were blamed for drone attacks on the Shaybah natural gas liquefaction facility last month and on other oil facilities in May. There have been other sources of tension in the region, often stemming from the rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Saudi Arabia and the US both blamed Iran for attacks in the Gulf on two oil tankers in June and July, allegations Tehran denied. In May, four tankers, two of them Saudi-flagged, were damaged by explosions within the UAE's territorial waters in the Gulf of Oman. Saudi Arabia and then US National Security Adviser John Bolton blamed Iran. Tehran said the accusations were ""ridiculous"". Tension in the vital shipping lanes worsened when Iran shot down a US surveillance drone over the Strait of Hormuz in June, leading a month later to the Pentagon announcing the deployment of US troops to Saudi Arabia."
geopolitical tensions,What do young Americans admire about Russia?,2024-09-15,2021-06-15,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-57421275,"For the first time since Joe Biden took office as US president, he will meet in person with Russian leader Vladimir Putin on Wednesday. The summit in Geneva, Switzerland, comes as both sides have acknowledged relations are at a new low. Here's what three young Americans and three young Russians told us about the other country. An independent who strongly aligns with progressive values, Connor is a college student who has been ""very pleased"" with his vote for President Biden so far.  Do you view Russia as an adversary or potential partner? I view the Russian government as an adversary and I believe certain conditions should be met in order for the United States to consider partnering with Putin's Russia. These conditions should require that Russia cease the imprisonment of journalists and opposition leaders. Additionally, Russia must agree to cease aggression with their southern and western neighbours. What do you think the two countries could work together on? With Russia and the United States having the first and second largest nuclear weapon stockpiles in the world, more joint denuclearisation treaties would be fantastic. I believe this joint mission is very important because it reduces the likelihood of accidents and creates an atmosphere of mutual trust. In the realm of trade, as the North Pole continues to melt, this opens an extremely fast new sea route. It would be great to see the US and Russia jointly ensure the safe passage of trade vessels.  Is there anything about Russia you admire that the US doesn't have? I greatly admire the spirit of the Russian people. They have withstood a dark and strenuous 150 years and have persevered throughout, despite all the while contending with despotic national leadership.  Americans and Russians are bonded by a history of revolution, social unrest, and vast technological progress. I hope our shared history can allow us to come to a greater understanding of one another and bring about an era of reconciliation rather than escalation. A final year student at Moscow State University, Viktor has aspirations of working as an interpreter in the future. He believes the two countries should be working together on a range of issues. Do you view the US as an adversary or potential partner? Unfortunately, right now Russia and the US are seen mostly as foes. But I am convinced that our countries can and should become friends. They are two large nuclear powers, who have huge influence over their respective continents. Their cooperation and peaceful coexistence is in the interest of the whole world.  What do you think the two countries could work together on? Russia and the US should be cooperating in as many areas as possible. The most important ones, in my view, are military security, arms control and fighting terrorism. But also in education, academic exchange programmes, technology and innovations, and fighting infectious diseases. Is there anything about the US you admire that Russia doesn't have? I most admire about the US their attitude towards protecting their nature - their national parks, as well as support of internal tourism and creating infrastructure to strengthen it. I also admire how they develop international contacts in the academic sphere and how skilled they are at attracting talent and investment from other countries.  Gabrielle is a moderate Republican who voted for Joe Biden, but has been ""increasingly frustrated"" by his administration's policies and priorities. Do you view Russia as an adversary or potential partner? Point blank, Russia and Vladimir Putin are intense adversaries of the United States. The global order is stronger if Russia is fiercely committed to liberal democracy, but it has proved time and time again that is not the case. Instead, it has consistently preyed upon Nato tensions and is looking to expand Russian occupation of Ukraine and the Balkans. Continuous cyberattacks, undermining confidence in elections and acts of aggression have proven that Russia has no interest in protecting or working with any country.  What do you think the two countries could work together on? Given the role of Russia as a leading natural gas producer, it is vital that the United States and Russia strive to work together on clean and alternative energy sources. Steps must be taken towards transition for the future wellbeing of both countries and their economies.  Over reliance on oil is both a national and regional security threat, emphasising the need for global investment and partnership on alternative clean energy sources for continued global prosperity.  Is there anything about Russia you admire that the US doesn't have? While its citizens remain fiercely committed to democracy and freedom, the government consistently undermines them. I admire the fire and want for freedom and prosperity of the Russian people, and fiercely condemn the actions and corruption of the Russian government.  Alena organises media campaigns for charities. She believes Russia and the US should be partners but is sceptical of whether it is possible at present, given the tension between the two countries. Do you view the US as an adversary or potential partner? I am a pacifist and I'm against the escalation of geopolitical tensions, so I would say the US is a friend. If we, Russia, work at building friendly contacts with the US, and they do the same towards us, then our mutual cooperation will at the very least decrease international tension.  What do you think the two countries could work together on? First of all, on nuclear disarmament, on the development of technology and on cooperation in space, but also in science and education. Is there anything about the US you admire that Russia doesn't have? I can't answer this very easily, as I follow European politics and the countries of the EU more closely. Gordon is an aerospace engineer in Salt Lake City and a conservative voter who says he feels optimistic about the state of American politics. Do you view Russia as an adversary or potential partner? Currently, I see Russia more as an adversary, largely because of President Putin. It's hard to completely decipher what has been specifically ordered by President Putin and what he chooses to allow adversarial third parties within Russia to do. In either case, he bears much of the responsibility. The recent cyber attacks, thought to originate from Russian groups, have only increased tensions.  What do you think the two countries could work together on? I think just about the only thing the two countries can work on together is a new nuclear arms treaty that will include other nuclear powers such as China. There seems to be some willingness on that front from both sides. The difficult thing is that both countries have very different goals and allies, which often puts them at odds with each other. Is there anything about Russia you admire that the US doesn't have? I love the Russian culture and people. They have a rich history and still are a major influence in Europe and around the world. A professional photographer and self-described pacifist, Katya says the two countries need to focus on fighting Covid-19 together even though they are enemies. Do you view the US as an adversary or potential partner? I think that Russia considers the US a foe, but the US isn't concerned about this as it has its own problems and concerns. And you can hardly have friends in politics. What do you think the two countries could work together on? Right now, I would say the most important thing is cooperation in fighting the coronavirus pandemic and in restoring the global economy. Is there anything about the US you admire that Russia doesn't have? I am attracted to the people's openness to each other and their tolerance. But I'm not saying that is completely universal in the US. Interviews by Sam Cabral of BBC North America and Alexey Ilin of BBC Russian"
geopolitical tensions,Four things to watch at the Brics summit,2024-09-15,2017-09-04,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-41144276,"The leaders of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa are meeting amid heightened geopolitical tensions.  The summit of the so-called Brics nations brings together the five fast-growing economies, who are seeking a greater say in world affairs.  Economic ties will top the agenda at the three-day gathering in Xiamen, China which began Sunday. But North Korea's nuclear test and a border standoff between China and India could also colour discussions.  So what are the four key things to watch out for at this meeting?  While US President Donald Trump has pushed a protectionist trade agenda, pulling the US out of the Trans Pacific Partnership and renegotiating the North America Free Trade Agreement, China is striking a very different tone.  Chinese President Xi Jinping told the meeting that there is little to fear from closer trade ties.    ""We should push for an open world economy, promote trade liberalisation and facilitation, jointly create a new global value chain, and realise a global economic rebalancing,"" President Xi Jinping told Brics business leaders and senior officials in a speech on Sunday. ""The development of emerging markets and developing countries won't touch anyone's cheese, but instead will diligently grow the world economic pie,"" he said. But many countries have criticised China's trade policies, saying they discriminate against foreign businesses.  Even within Brics, trade is heavily tilted in China's favour, which has led to complaints from fellow members. China's vice minister of commerce, Wang Shouwen, also suggested China was interested in establishing a free trade agreement with Mexico. The Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto is attending the dialogue at the invitation of the Chinese president.  The sheer scale of China's massive international infrastructure project - known as One Belt One Road -  means it is often on the agenda at high level economic meetings like this one.  The project aims to expand trade links between Asia, Africa, Europe and beyond through infrastructure investments.  ""I am convinced that the Belt and Road initiative will serve as a new platform for all countries to achieve win-win cooperation,"" said President Xi.  But the initiative has made India in particular quite uneasy, as it includes projects worth $62bn (£48bn) to be implemented in its neighbour and rival Pakistan.  Also, tensions between China and India remain high after a border standoff, which was resolved just days before the conference.   Construction began over the weekend on headquarters in Shanghai for the New Development Bank (NDB), which is the Brics alternative to the World Bank.   The NDB was seen as the first major Brics achievement after the group came together to press for a bigger say in the world's financial affairs. The bank aims to address a massive infrastructure funding gap in the member countries, which account for almost half the world's population. To date, the NDB has invested in 11 projects, lending $1.5bn in 2016 with an additional $2.5bn in loans set for this year.  Still, the bank is small potatoes when compared with the World Bank, and some have questioned China's commitment, given it heads up the bigger Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. The conference had an unwelcome surprise in the form of North Korea's sixth nuclear test on Sunday.    China's official Xinhua news agency reported that Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin met on the sidelines of the Brics meeting, and agreed to ""appropriately deal"" with North Korea's nuclear test. China said it strongly condemned the nuclear test and urged Pyongyang to stop its ""wrong"" actions. The US President suggested on Twitter that the US might stop ""all trade with any country doing business with North Korea"". China is an obvious target of his comments, given that it is North Korea's largest trading partner.   Some critics, however, have suggested that this is very unlikely, as it would do significant damage to the US economy because China is also America's largest trading partner.  "
geopolitical tensions,Merkel visits Trump - so will she envy Macron's bromance?,2024-09-15,2018-04-26,By Jenny Hill,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-43904659,"It's hardly a match made in political heaven.  German Chancellor Angela Merkel has never had much in common with Donald Trump.  A free-trading, peace-loving supporter of the Iran nuclear deal will sit down for talks in Washington on Friday with a bellicose protectionist, who described as ""insane"" and ""the worst ever"" the accord that saw Iran limit its nuclear activities in return for the lifting of economic sanctions.  When the US president was first elected, few in Berlin thought the liberal, steady chancellor, not known for flamboyant display, would strike up any kind of relationship with the impulsive, dramatic Donald Trump.  Certainly no-one expected a close relationship like the warm alliance which developed between Mrs Merkel and Barack Obama (once they had overcome the awkward revelation that the Americans had been listening to her mobile phone calls).  That relationship bore political fruit for Mrs Merkel - and her country. Germany's leader was the voice of Europe for America and the go-to interlocutor between the US and Russia, a result in part of President Vladimir Putin's grudging respect for Mrs Merkel.  Nevertheless, behind the scenes, officials believe that Mrs Merkel's first visit to Washington, in March 2017, was not the complete disaster they had feared. Despite some tricky moments (the unforgettable handshake that never happened), Mrs Merkel and Mr Trump do have a working relationship and are said to speak with some regularity on the phone.  So as her second visit approaches should Mrs Merkel - as the tabloid newspaper Bild asked - be jealous of that kiss between Donald Trump and Emmanuel Macron, during the latter's visit to the White House this week? Is the French president - the newspaper agonised between the lines - poised to replace Mrs Merkel as the leader to call in Europe? After all, the daily Die Zeit notes, Donald Trump has far more in common with President Macron: they share a business background and both take a populist approach to politics.  Until recently, the newspaper argues, Mr Macron has avoided overt criticism of the US president. Angela Merkel has clearly and repeatedly voiced her disdain for some of his polices.  Berlin has, doubtless, watched Mr Macron's visit closely. But, in reality, there is little concern about a race to become Mr Trump's new friend in Europe.  Concerned by Mr Trump's apparent disinterest in the EU, the French and German leaders prepared together for their respective visits to Washington. Character and style differ, but the message is broadly the same. Both the French and German delegations have been so closely co-ordinated that, sources say, this should be viewed as a single, orchestrated European approach.  And so the agenda for Mrs Merkel's visit is already set and mirrors Emmanuel Macron's. At the very top, tariffs and trade. Mr Macron's visit has failed to produce a commitment from Donald Trump to exempt the EU from his tariffs on metal imports. With a 1 May deadline approaching, Mrs Merkel is under pressure from her EU peers to broker a permanent exemption.  Then there is that other looming deadline. On 12 May Mr Trump must decide whether to reimpose sanctions on Iran, which would in effect scupper the nuclear deal.  Mr Macron has conceded that he failed to persuade the US president of the deal's value. Mrs Merkel will be prioritising the issue.  No one is pretending this will be easy. The leaders are also due to discuss Nordstream 2, Russia's controversial new pipeline that will bring natural gas to Europe, bypassing Ukraine and Poland. Donald Trump is not a fan. Mrs Merkel is, although she has recently begun to mute her support for the project, worried about the geopolitical ramifications.  And, as if the leaders needed more controversy, the subject of Germany's contributions to Nato are also listed for discussion. Commentators note that Mrs Merkel won't want to be seen to cave in to Mr Trump's demand for higher payments (and a commitment to increase German defence spending was in place prior to his election). The Trump administration is not popular among the German electorate; even if she could, few here want to see their leaders cosying up to Mr Trump.  As Bild also noted, the newspaper unable to resist a gleeful tone, Mr Macron may have flattered the Trump ego, but he did not achieve much.  Angela Merkel is not one for turning on the charm in these situations. She'll take a pragmatic approach, but no one in Berlin is expecting miracles. "
geopolitical tensions,Migrant caravan heads to US as key summit begins,2024-09-15,2022-06-07,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-61685118,"Thousands of migrants are headed to the US-Mexican border in a caravan timed to coincide with a meeting of Western Hemisphere leaders in Los Angeles.  Some 6,000 people, including many from Venezuela and Central America, have begun walking from the southern tip of Mexico north as part of a caravan.  Migration is among the top issues on the agenda at the Summit of the Americas.  The caravan may be one of the largest in recent years.  On Monday, the group began its 1,270 mile (2,000 km) journey to the US from the Mexican city of Tapachula, near the country's border with Guatemala. It is unclear when they will arrive at the northern frontier. The group's organisers say it is made up of people who are fleeing instability, violence and poverty in their home countries.  Robinson Reyes, 35, a Colombian migrant, said he was traveling north after waiting in vain in Mexico for a month for a humanitarian visa.  ""We want a future for our family,"" he told Reuters. ""We are not violent. We just want a better future.""  Mr Reyes added that the caravan timed its departure to coincide with the Summit of the Americas in Los Angeles, where regional leaders are expected to announce new plans to address mass migration from Latin America.  ""That's why we went out today,"" he said. ""God willing, they can talk and resolve this"".  Efforts to address migration at the summit are likely to be complicated by geopolitical tensions, however.  Earlier this week, Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said he would not attend after the White House announced that Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua - all significant source countries for migrants - would be excluded from the summit. A senior administration official cited a ""lack of democratic space"" and deteriorating human rights situations in all three countries as the reason for their exclusion.  On Friday, US President Joe Biden is scheduled to hold a meeting with regional leaders to sign a declaration aimed at addressing migration.  A senior official told reporters on Monday that Mr Biden would also discuss a ""bold"" new plan aimed at ""responsibility sharing and economic support for countries that have been most impacted by refugees and migration"".  The official added that Mexico is still expected to sign despite Mr López Obrador's absence.  ""We believe in every way they are fully committed to it,"" the official said. "
geopolitical tensions,Why does Oracle's billionaire founder want TikTok?,2024-09-15,2020-09-14,By Cristina Criddle,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-54148474,"Software giant Oracle is believed to be the frontrunner in the bidding war for short-form video app TikTok.  Microsoft dropped out of negotiations with Chinese-company Bytedance on Sunday night, after which Reuters reported that Oracle would become its technology partner and assume management of TikTok's US user data. The partnership should address US security concerns but not be a complete sale, sources told the agency. However, Chinese state media has said Bytedance will not sell its US operations outright, nor will it share TikTok's source code. Oracle sells database technology and cloud systems to businesses. It was one of the first companies to help clients structure their records in this way. Co-founder and current chairman Larry Ellison named the company after the codename given to a project for its first customer, in 1975: the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). The firm was founded two years later and went on to complete contracts for the CIA, Navy Intelligence, Air Force Intelligence and the National Security Agency. News site Gizmodo has detailed Oracle's involvement with US government intelligence community, and says it is relationship that has been ""frequently ignored by people who like to pretend Oracle was just another humble Silicon Valley start-up"". But its clients and cloud-based services now extend far wider, from serving auto-makers including Mazda and Yamaha to retailers such as the UK's Co-op and Debenhams chains. Oracle's technologies can be used to keep track of everything, Mr Ellison has said. ""The information about your banks, your checking balance, your savings balance, is stored in an Oracle database,"" he said in Jeffery Rosen's 2004 book The Naked Crowd. ""Your airline reservation is stored in an Oracle database. What books you bought on Amazon is stored in an Oracle database. Your profile on Yahoo! is stored in an Oracle database… Privacy is already gone."" The US administration claims TikTok and other Chinese apps are national security threats which is why - given its history in intelligence - Oracle might be considered a trustworthy option. ""On the surface, Oracle and TikTok don't seem like bedfellows,"" said Chris Stokel-Walker, author of a forthcoming book about the platform. ""Oracle is a relatively boring business-to-business company, whereas TikTok is a youth-centred, casual app. ""But there is underlying geopolitics. If [US President Donald] Trump's fears around TikTok are rooted in security, the company would be a safer bet."" Mr Ellison - who is ranked the world's fifth richest person by Forbes - has been openly supportive of President Trump and held a fundraiser for him in February. The president had previously said he thought Oracle was best placed to seal the TikTok deal. ""I think Oracle is a great company, and I think its owner is a tremendous guy,"" Mr Trump said last month. ""He's a tremendous person. I think that Oracle would be certainly somebody that could handle it."" But any deal would require the approval of both American and Chinese governments - and Chinese state media has reported that Bytedance will not sell the company to Oracle. Oracle has been accused of hostility towards China, after firing 900 staff from its team in the country last year, in the same week additional tariffs on Chinese goods were introduced in the US. Employees blamed tensions between the US and China for the cuts. It is understood that Oracle's involvement in TikTok will not be an outright sale but instead a ""tech partnership"", the Wall Street Journal and Reuters report. That suggests the US firm's control over the business would be limited. Two weeks ago, China announced new government restrictions on tech exports. They mean some technologies involving artificial intelligence techniques need government approval before any sale to a foreign entity takes place. Many view the way TikTok decides which videos to recommend to whom and when as being its key asset, and it may be that Oracle will not be allowed to know exactly how it works or make use of it for other purposes, ""A deal where Oracle takes over hosting without source code and significant operational changes would not address any of the legitimate concerns about TikTok, and the White House accepting such a deal would demonstrate that this exercise was pure grift,"" Alex Stamos, former chief security officer at Facebook, tweeted. But another expert thinks the partnership could work. ""The security element with Oracle could ease tensions, but it can also help TikTok be a bit more mature in its outlook,"" said Tamara Littleton,  founder of The Social Element consultancy. ""TikTok is struggling to control its content at the moment, and its revered algorithm can work against it sometimes. Oracle's experience could help to fix some of these problems."" TikTok and Oracle both declined to comment when contacted by the BBC."
geopolitical tensions,India sees opportunity in anti-China backlash,2024-09-15,2020-05-18,By Nikhil Inamdar,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-52672510,"With Covid-19 infecting millions across the world, China is facing an unprecedented global backlash that could destabilise its reign as the world's factory of choice. Its neighbour India has sensed an opportunity and is keen to make inroads to a space it hopes China will vacate sooner rather than later.  China's weakened global position is a ""blessing in disguise"" for India to attract more investment, transport minister Nitin Gadkari said in a recent interview. The northern state of Uttar Pradesh, which has a population the size of Brazil, is already forming an economic task force to attract firms keen to ditch China.  India is also readying a pool of land twice the size of Luxembourg to offer companies that want to move manufacturing out of China, and has reached out to 1,000 American multinationals, Bloomberg reported. ""This outreach has been an ongoing process,"" Deepak Bagla, chief executive of Invest India, the government's national investment promotion agency told the BBC. ""Covid will only accelerate the process of de-risking from China for many of these companies.""  The US-India Business Council (USIBC), a powerful lobby group that works to enhance investment flows between India and the US, also said that India has significantly stepped up its pitch.  ""We are seeing India prioritise efforts to attract supply chains, both at central and state government level,"" Nisha Biswal, President of USIBC and the former assistant secretary of state for south and central Asian affairs in the US Department of State, told the BBC.   ""Companies that already have some manufacturing in India may be earlier movers in reducing output in plants in China and scaling up in production in India.""  But things are still at an evaluation stage and decisions are unlikely to be made in a hurry, she added.  In an environment where global balance sheets are fractured, relocating entire supply chains is easier said than done.  ""Many of these companies are facing severe cash and capital constraints because of the pandemic, and will therefore be very cautious before making quick moves,"" independent economist Rupa Subramanya said.  According to Rahul Jacob, a long-time China watcher and former Financial Times bureau chief in Hong Kong, the Indian government putting together land banks is a step in the right direction, but large companies are unlikely to move their operations just because land is made available.  ""Production lines and supply chains are far more sticky than most people seem to understand. It is very difficult to pull them apart overnight,"" he said. ""China offers integrated infrastructure like large ports and highways, top quality labour and sophisticated logistics, all of which are critical factors to meet strict deadlines that international companies operate on."" Another reason India might not be the obvious choice for global multinationals is because it isn't well integrated with major global supply chains.  Last year Delhi pulled out of a crucial multilateral trade agreement with 12 other Asian countries, collectively known as the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), despite seven years of negotiations. Decisions like these make it difficult for Indian exporters to benefit from tariff-free access to destination markets or offer reciprocity to its trading partners.  ""Why would I make something that I want to sell to Singapore in India? Being connected in trade agreements institutionally is as important as offering competitive prices,"" Parag Khanna, author of The Future is Asian, told the BBC.  Regional integration is particularly crucial he believes, as global trade begins to follow the ""sell where you make"" model where companies so-called ""near-source"" rather than out-source production and bring it closer to demand.  India's volatile relationship with foreign direct investment (FDI) and uneven regulation is also something that continues to bother global companies. From prohibiting e-commerce companies to sell non-essential items and tweaking FDI rules to disallow easier capital flows from neighbouring countries, the fear is that India has used the pandemic to build protectionist walls around itself.  In a recent address to the nation, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi made ""be vocal for local"" his rallying cry. New stimulus proposals meanwhile have increased thresholds for foreign companies bidding for Indian contracts.  ""The more that India can improve regulatory stability, the better its chances of persuading more global businesses to establish hubs in India,"" says Mr Biswal. So then who, If not India?  As things stand, Vietnam, Bangladesh, South Korea and Taiwan seem to be favourites to benefit from the backlash against China. The latter two at the ""high-tech end of the spectrum"" and Vietnam and Bangladesh at the lower end, according to Mr Jacob.  Multinationals began moving production out of China into these countries nearly a decade ago due to rising labour and environmental costs. The slow exodus has only gathered pace as US-China trade tensions have increased in recent years.  Since June 2018, a month before the trade war began, US goods imports from Vietnam have soared by more than 50% and those from Taiwan by 30%, according to calculations made by the South China Morning Post newspaper. India is seen to have lost out because it failed to create conditions allowing multinationals to supply not only the local market, but also to use the country as a production base to export to the world.  In recent weeks, several states have begun making moves to address some concerns around the ease of doing business - prime among them being making contentious changes to India's archaic labour laws, put in place to reduce exploitation. Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh states, for instance, have suspended significant labour protections exempting factories from even maintaining basic requirements like cleanliness, ventilation, lighting and toilets.  The intention is to improve the investment climate and attract global capital.  But such decisions could become counterproductive and hurt rather than help, says Mr Jacob: ""International companies would be very wary about this. They have strict codes of conduct on labour, environment and safety standards for suppliers.""  The 2013 collapse of the Rana Plaza garment factory in Bangladesh that supplied retailers like Walmart was a turning point. It forced Bangladesh to significantly improve factory infrastructure and safety to clinch more investment, he cautions.  ""India has to follow better standards. These are white board ideas drafted on Powerpoint by bureaucrats who are completely divorced from the reality of global trade.""  But with the US weighing punitive action against China, Japan paying its corporations to move out of the country and UK lawmakers coming under pressure to reconsider their decision to allow Chinese telecoms giant Huawei a role in building the country's new 5G data network, global anti-China sentiment is increasing.  The time is ripe, say experts, for India to undertake broad-based structural reforms and use these sweeping geopolitical shifts to modify its trading relationship with the world. "
geopolitical tensions,Why South Koreans want the nuclear bomb,2024-09-15,2023-04-21,By Jean Mackenzie,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-65333139," Hidden away in the private room of an underground restaurant in Seoul, a disparate group of South Koreans have gathered for a clandestine lunch. Among the mix are politicians, scientists, and military people, some of whose identities are too sensitive to reveal. This is the meeting of the newly formed Forum for Nuclear Strategy, and their lunchtime agenda is ambitious - to plot out how South Korea can develop nuclear weapons. This once-fringe idea has exploded into the mainstream over the past months. Even South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol raised the possibility during a defence meeting, making him the only president to have put this option on the table in recent times. Now newspaper columns trumpet the idea daily, while a staggering three-quarters of the public support it. South Koreans have grown anxious about their nuclear-armed neighbour to the north, and on Wednesday Mr Yoon is heading to the White House, seeking President Joe Biden's help. South Korea previously flirted with the idea of developing nuclear weapons in the 1970s, when it ran a secret programme. But when the United States found out, it issued an ultimatum: Seoul could carry on, or have the US defend it, with the full force of its existing nuclear arsenal. It picked US support, and to this day tens of thousands of US troops remain stationed on the Korean peninsula. Since then, the geopolitical situation has shifted dramatically. North Korea is building ever-more sophisticated nuclear weapons that can target cities across the US, leaving people to question whether Washington would still come to South Korea's defence. Here is the scenario they chew over: a belligerent Kim Jong-un attacks South Korea, forcing the US to intervene. Mr Kim then threatens to detonate a nuclear bomb over the US mainland unless it withdraws from the war. What does Washington do? Does it risk having San Francisco reduced to rubble to save Seoul? Probably not, is the conclusion those at the secret lunchtime meeting have come to.  ""It is irrational to think another country should protect us. This is our problem and our responsibility,"" said Choi Ji-young, a forum member and member of South Korea's ruling People Power Party. The chairman of the forum, academic Cheong Seong-chang, presented their suggested plan. The next time the North tests a nuclear weapon, Seoul would withdraw from the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). If, within six months, Mr Kim has not agreed to discuss giving up some of his weapons, Seoul would start building its own. Mr Cheong argues that this would reduce the probability of a nuclear war on the Korean peninsula, as Mr Kim would be less likely to attack, knowing the South could strike back. But Jenny Town, from the US-based think tank 38 North, challenges the assumption that a nuclear-armed South would make the North less adventurous. ""More nuclear weapons does not make the world safer from nuclear use,"" she said. ""If you look at India and Pakistan as an example, this is not what we have seen. If anything, being nuclear-armed has sort of given them both the green light to go a little further."" A nuclear-armed South Korea is absolutely not what Washington wants. Yet, this beast is partly of America's making. In 2016, then-President Donald Trump accused South Korea of free-riding. He threatened to make Seoul pay for the US troops stationed on its soil, or else he would withdraw them. The fear those words instilled in people has not lessened with time. An increasing number of South Koreans, acutely aware that America's promises are only as good as its next leader, now favour building the bomb.  On a recent Sunday afternoon, at a local sauna in Seoul, people young and old from all backgrounds gathered to ease their weekly aches, while indulging in beer and fried chicken. While it might seem strange to discuss nuclear proliferation in such a setting, these days, it is almost in the realm of small talk.  ""The US is not going to use its nukes to defend us, so we should be in control of our own defence,"" said 31-year-old Koo Sung-wook, who swayed this way during his time in the military. He served in 2010, during a major crisis when North Korea shelled a South Korean island, killing four people. ""It felt like a total emergency. Units were calling their parents and writing wills,"" he recounted. Now he worries not just about North Korea, but China too. ""We are surrounded by these great powers and walking on eggshells around them. To be competitive, we need to have nukes.""  Almost everyone at the sauna agreed, even 82-year-old Hong In-su. A child during the Korean War in the 1950s, she said she was anti-nuclear weapons, before reluctantly concluding they were a necessary evil: ""Other countries are developing theirs, so I don't see how we can go on without them. The world is changing."" Another woman was torn over whether the US would defend South Korea, and thought it ""better to have nukes just in case"", while a young mother worried that Seoul's current relationship with the US could change at any moment. Washington is now scrambling to reassure its ally of its ""iron-clad"" commitment to its defence. Earlier this month it stationed a gigantic nuclear-powered aircraft carrier in the southern port of Busan. But to the frustration of US policymakers, such reassuring gestures no longer seem to be working.  Seoul's politicians have grown wary of being kept in the dark, unclear about what would trigger the US president to push the nuclear button on their behalf. Currently, there is no requirement for Mr Biden to even tell Mr Yoon before doing so. ""At the very least we could build in a mandatory phone call, so long as it is understood that this is still the US president's decision,"" Ms Town said. Yang Uk, a defence analyst with the Seoul-based Asan Institute, was in the room with President Yoon when he made his remarks about South Korea going nuclear. He claims Mr Yoon was indirectly pressuring the US. ""The US is so reluctant to discuss its nuclear policy with South Korea and yet if a nuclear war broke out on the peninsula we are the ones who would suffer the most,"" he said. Seoul is pushing to be more involved in the planning and execution around nuclear use. That could mean having US nuclear weapons stationed in South Korea, or to have a nuclear sharing arrangement, similar to that in Europe, where South Korea is able to use US weapons in the event of a war. A less drastic option would be to create a joint nuclear-planning group. The US is unlikely to offer up much, but knows it must deliver something concrete that President Yoon can chalk up as a win, and sell to the South Korean public. Even so, it may prove too late. This once inconceivable idea is now so firmly planted in the South Korean psyche, it is difficult to see how it can be uprooted. Going nuclear is a mammoth decision. The current international order is built on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, and those that threaten this order, such as Iran and North Korea, have paid a high price. Analysts say the South Korean public has probably not considered the consequences. The US could pull out of its defence commitment, China might retaliate ferociously by hounding South Korea with sanctions, and their country could end up isolated, another failed pariah state, its dazzling international reputation in tatters. At the sauna, people seemed unperturbed by these scenarios. Only one woman conceded that if it meant South Korea becoming ""an axis of evil"" then it was probably not worth it. But that is unlikely to happen. South Korea is too strategically and economically important for it to be shunned like North Korea. Most analysts do not even believe the US would end its decades-long military alliance. Instead, the concern is that a potential South Korean nuclear armament would create such a crack in the non-proliferation regime, it would cause other countries to follow. Only 82-year-old Hong In-su seemed to grapple with the dangers ahead. She quoted a Korean proverb that roughly translates to ""you fall in your own poop"", or in other words, this could seriously backfire. ""I do think nuclear weapons will come back to harm us,"" she said. ""I feel bad for the next generation."""
geopolitical tensions,The PowerPoint that sparked an international row,2024-09-15,2020-09-27,By Gordon Corera,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-54270739,"When Meng Wanzhou's flight landed in Vancouver on 1 December 2018, she was expecting to make only a brief stopover. But after almost a three-year prolonged stay, the chief financial officer of Huawei and daughter of the telecoms giant's founder is now a free woman.  On Friday, prosecutors announced that a request to extradite her to the US had been dropped.  During the three years of intense legal battles, Canada was caught in the escalating tension between Washington and Beijing.  At the centre of the story is a sixteen-page corporate PowerPoint presentation.  When her plane from Hong Kong landed, Meng Wanzhou planned to go to a house she owned in the Canadian city to collect some luggage before catching another flight to Mexico for a corporate meeting.   But instead she was questioned by Canadian border security agents for three hours as her phone was seized and luggage searched.  When that was over, she was formally admitted into Canada. It was at this point that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police moved in and arrested her because of an extradition request filed by the US. The US wanted Ms Meng to stand trial on charges including fraud linked to the alleged violation of US sanctions against Iran, allegations she denies.  The PowerPoint was used by Ms Meng at a meeting with the bank HSBC on 22 August 2013, and is seen as key evidence against her. Reuters news reports in the preceding months had raised questions about whether there had been a breach of trade sanctions on Iran by Hong Kong-based firm Skycom.  At issue was whether Skycom, a telecoms equipment seller, was simply a business partner of Huawei's - or a front for it to conceal its activities in Iran.  The US alleged that in the meeting - the one with the PowerPoint presentation - Ms Meng misled HSBC over the true nature of Huawei's relationship with Skycom and this, in turn, put the bank at risk of violating sanctions against Iran.  Her lawyers said the US misled the court, in particular about the PowerPoint, by omitting key information on two slides which showed HSBC was not, in fact, being kept in the dark about the true nature of the Skycom/Huawei relationship. Ms Meng's lawyers launched a multi-pronged attack on the US extradition request itself.  An initial attempt to claim that the crime for which she is charged in the US is not a crime in Canada failed (although that can be appealed).  Another challenge centred on politics around the case.  Her lawyers claimed that comments made by US President Donald Trump, which indicated a willingness to use the case as a bargaining chip in trade negotiations with China, constituted an abuse of process.  Another challenge related to her treatment at the airport in Vancouver. Her lawyers argued there was an abuse of process in the way she was treated.  They fought to have certain documents disclosed, including from the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, and sought to uncover what role US officials might have played in her arrest at the time.  A judge turned down requests for some documents.  It was thought that the case could take between five and 10 years to come to a conclusion.  Last month, Ms Meng appeared in court as a judge heard the final arguments about whether to send her to the US. Her case was also raised in high-level discussions between senior US and Chinese diplomats.  Huawei executives were also in touch with the US government to try and secure her release.  And then on Friday, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) announced it had reached a deferred prosecution agreement. This means that the DOJ will hold off from prosecuting Ms Meng until late next year and if she complies with conditions set by the court, the case will eventually be dropped.  Within hours, she had left Vancouver on a plane bound for China. The impact of the case has rippled far and wide.  The arrest of such a high-profile business figure led to anger in China. The country's ambassador said Canada had been ""taken advantage of"" and made an ""accomplice"" by America as Washington carried out a ""barbaric act of bullying"".  HSBC was put in a difficult position with Chinese media questioning how far the bank co-operated with the US in building the case they described as a politically driven trap.  The bank, already caught between the West and China over its stance on Hong Kong, maintained it only did what it was legally required to do and that there was no entrapment. The case has also raised broader questions over which countries might arrest business executives if they were to receive requests from the US.  It has led to concern that Western businesspeople and other travellers could find themselves detained by China to be used as bargaining chips. Two Canadians were detained days after Ms Meng's arrest. Michael Kovrig, a former diplomat, and Michael Spavor, a businessman, were later charged with spying. China has denied any link but the pair's detention was widely interpreted as a direct response to Ms Meng's arrest.  Last month, a Chinese court sentenced Spavor to 11 years in prison.  Then hours after a Canadian judge ended extradition proceedings against Meng, it was revealed that China had released the two men and they were flying home."
geopolitical tensions,Climate change: Storm clouds gather after COP26,2024-09-15,2021-12-29,By Matt McGrath,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-59744522,"Is the progress that was made at the COP26 Glasgow climate summit already in jeopardy because of challenges in the year ahead? 2021 was a momentous year for climate change.  As well as a host of extreme, destructive events influenced by rising temperatures, the past 12 months have seen unprecedented political engagement on the issue, culminating in the COP26 summit in Glasgow in November. Progress was undoubtedly made and the overall thrust of the meeting was towards more rapid action on a whole host of measures to curb emissions. But there are now growing concerns that this momentum may dissipate over the coming months.  The most grievous blow comes from the US. The potential failure of President Biden to get his Build Back Better act through Congress would significantly impact the ability of the US to meet the tough climate targets that the White House has committed to.   It would also hugely affect the relatively unified approach to climate change on display among world leaders at COP26. ""Everything that Biden pledged, led to this relatively good atmosphere and a sense of momentum in Glasgow,"" said Dr Joanna Depledge, a fellow at the Cambridge Centre for Environment, Energy and Natural Resource Governance.  ""But these were just promises, he needs to get the bill through Congress. And it's now looking increasingly dicey. He can do some things with executive orders, but that certainly isn't the kind of sustained institutional climate legislation change that we're really looking for.""  ""I think the situation to us, is critical."" The despair among many in the US over the possible failure of President Biden's bill will also have knock-on effects throughout the world. This will certainly be the case in China, a country smarting from the perception that it flexed its political muscle in Glasgow to get its way. Biden's political difficulties with the bill are seen as more evidence that the ""West is declining"". ""I am worried 2022 will see a fuller display of geopolitical tension dominating the climate agenda,"" said Li Shuo, from Greenpeace East Asia.  He is also concerned that the mooted introduction of carbon taxes on imported goods into Europe could elevate a sense of unfairness and frustration in Beijing. ""The Chinese side will see how they are treated vis-a-vis others and make its judgment on whether the game is fair, and most importantly, if it is about the environment at all, or just geopolitics and trade,"" he told BBC News. Overall, I am looking at a more turbulent year ahead. The years before the Paris agreement were an example of geopolitics helping the climate agenda forward. What lies ahead may be the opposite."" This pessimistic outlook is echoed by the fact that next year's COP is being held in Egypt, and the one after that in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).  ""Neither of these countries could be described as climate leaders,"" said Prof J Timmons Roberts from Brown University in Rhode Island, US. The good side is that COP27 will be in a developing country, and some issues like loss and damage [who pays for the impact of climate change in the worst affected countries, and how it is paid] may get more traction, but on the issue of emissions reductions, it's not clear that they're going to be leaders."" Another key concern heading into 2022 is that some countries may simply ignore aspects of the Glasgow climate pact that they don't like.  One key measure in the deal was the request for all countries to ""revisit and strengthen"" their national climate pledges by the time delegates gather in Egypt late in 2022.  Despite agreeing to this, a number of countries now say they simply won't update their plans, among them Australia and New Zealand. New Zealand's climate minister James Shaw told national media that this provision really only applied to large emitters like India, China, Russia and Brazil which hadn't significantly strengthened their plans in time for Glasgow. However, there are also some positive developments in the offing that could make a significant difference to the general mood around climate change. During COP26, the UK, EU, US, Germany and France agreed to pay $8.5bn to help South Africa abandon coal. Now, those close to the negotiations say that two new deals to help India and Indonesia move away from the most carbon-intensive energy source are in the pipeline. These will be expensive, running into the tens of billions, but if they happen, they would represent a massive step away from fossil fuels. These types of arrangements, and the commitment to doubling adaptation finance made by richer countries will be key to progress in 2022, say officials.  Another positive is that the UK's presidency continues right up to next November when Egypt takes over.  COP26 President Alok Sharma has made it clear that he intends to push forward over the coming months in efforts to ensure that the agreements secured in Glasgow on deforestation, coal, finance and cars will start to be implemented.  Mr Sharma's background as an auditor will come in handy in making sure there's no slippage over the integrity of the commitments made.  ""The UK, as hosts of COP26, spent the last two years working tirelessly with countries to build trust, which ultimately allowed us to deliver the Glasgow climate pact,"" he told BBC News. ""We will continue in the same vein through 2022 to make sure countries keep their promises, re-visit their emissions reductions targets, get finance flowing, and deliver on the many commitments made during the two weeks of the summit."" Another positive is the fact that Germany will chair the G7 group of countries. The co-leader of the German Green party is now the country's foreign minister, so climate will remain high on the international diplomatic agenda.  Infrastructure investment in the wake of the Covid pandemic, especially in middle income countries, also offers a great chance to lock in significant action to limit emissions.  The final agreement on the rules for carbon markets, agreed in Glasgow, has coincided with a record rise in the price of carbon permits in Europe and the UK.  While this has downsides, a sustained high carbon price could significantly speed up a transition to cleaner sources of energy. But, as ever, global events could see all these potential positives quickly pale.  Disputes between Russia and Ukraine, China's disengagement and a drubbing for the Democrats in mid-term elections in the US could all derail or at least delay any further progress on climate change.  And stalling or taking small steps right now would be a disaster for efforts to keep the rise in global temperatures under 1.5C this century. ""Right now, incremental steps are a death sentence,"" said Prof Roberts.  However, the climate negotiations process is highly unpredictable - and even when things appear to be at their darkest, countries are often able to make sufficient compromises to keep things moving forward.  Certainly the COP26 president says he's determined to push ahead and that the UK can be a role model for others. ""Leaving COP26 with the Glasgow climate pact was a historic moment demonstrating the world's shared commitment to taking real climate action,"" said Alok Sharma. ""As we look ahead, the most pressing issue is the timescale on when this action takes place and the reality is that the world needs to act at a much faster pace."" ""I believe we will reach a net zero world, and the UK is leading the way through our own actions such as rapidly expanding our renewables sector and working to eliminate the use of coal from our electricity generation in 2024, the question is whether that will be fast enough to avoid the worst effects of climate change.""

geopolitical tensions,Why more Australians are giving up their pets,2024-09-15,2022-10-22,By Annabelle Liang & Monica Miller,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63071930,"""It's quite a sad day when people have to make a choice of either feeding their animals or their children. For some people, sadly, it has got to that situation."" Suzana Talevski knows this well. Her Lost Dogs' Home animal shelter in Melbourne, Australia looks after hundreds of domestic animals - and their numbers are growing by the day. One of the shelter's newest guests is four-year-old Charcoal, a 63kg Neapolitan mastiff. He was given up by his owners who said they could no longer afford a pet. And they are not alone in their struggles. The cost of living has soared around the world as the effects of the pandemic and the Ukraine war push up the price of food, fuel and other essentials. It is not just the food that we eat that is now costing more - prices for pet food and other products for domestic animals have also jumped. Feeding Charcoal costs as much as A$1,600 ($998; £886) a year, Ms Talevski estimates. ""We have 500 animals at our shelter. That's many mouths to feed. We feel the pinch in terms of buying supplies, keeping up with pet food, and making sure all our animals are healthy,"" she adds. Official figures show that the cost of pet products in Australia jumped by almost 12% in the year to the end of June. That's double the rise shoppers are seeing in prices for their own food and drinks. When the pandemic began, Canberra Pet Rescue started a programme to provide struggling owners with pet food and other essentials. More than two years on, its founder Amanda Doelle told the BBC that many people are still seeking help. Ms Doelle says she has also received more requests from people wishing to give up their pets. A recent arrival is 11-year-old tabby Lilu. Her owner lost her job and home, meaning she could no longer afford to keep her. ""She did really try. She was in tears, she was really upset about it,"" Ms Doelle says. ""She was facing homelessness so she had no way to actually keep the cat."" Inundated with requests and rising costs, Ms Doelle has asked the government to fund her initiative, but says she has been forced to turn away some animals. ""It's absolutely unmanageable. The animals are flooding through pounds and through shelters. ""Cost-of-living pressures are a large factor. But people are also having second thoughts about pets they adopted during the pandemic."" Abandoning a pet is an offence in Australia. But financial pressure is ""leaving people in desperate situations"", says Rebecca Linigen from Four Paws Australia. ""Not only are animal surrender rates up, but some shelters across Australia are also reporting that adoption rates are down since 2021,"" she told the BBC. ""This is a crisis in companion animal welfare for our nation, with real fears that animals will be abandoned on the streets to fend for themselves if they are considered a financial burden."" The ingredients of pet foods include meat, grains and micronutrients - all of which have become more expensive in recent months. It's a global problem. The cost of pet food is up by 10.3% in the US, 8.8% in the European Union, and 8.4% in the UK. Animal rescue groups in other countries are also seeing a jump in the number of animals being brought to their shelters, as household finances are squeezed. ""Many are telling our teams how they're going without food themselves to be able to afford food and vet care for their pets, and even having to make the heartbreaking decision to rehome their beloved companion,"" says Alyson Jones of Blue Cross, which runs pet food banks and animal hospitals in the UK. ""We're doing what we can to keep people and their pets together, but sadly we are seeing more animals coming into our care,"" she adds. Jacob Thomas from Rescue Paws in Thailand says he has received queries from people wanting to leave Thailand because they lost their job, or who were getting less income because of the increase in the cost of living. ""Those queries have massively increased since the beginning of the pandemic,"" he says. Helping to drive up food prices is the soaring cost of energy used in their production, says Prof William Chen from Singapore's Nanyang Technological University. ""The uncertainties on food production remain as a result of climate change, the Covid-19 pandemic and geopolitical tensions,"" he says. ""Together with the perception that pet food may be seen as less critical as compared with consumer food, prices for pet food may not fall any time soon."" Back in Australia, Charcoal has been taken on by a foster carer but is still waiting for his forever home. ""His favourite hobbies are following his humans around, ball play and couch time,"" Ms Talevski says. ""He is now in a foster home awaiting some surgery before being ready for adoption,"" she adds."
geopolitical tensions,Will Moldova choose EU or Putin?,2024-09-15,2014-11-29,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-30197671,"Between East and West - Russian dolls can be bought in Chisinau markets Sunday's electoral contest between pro-Russian and pro-Western forces in Moldova has taken on an unprecedented, wider significance in the shadow of the crisis in neighbouring Ukraine. The former Soviet republic's governing pro-Western coalition is seeking closer ties with the European Union, but the Russian government is seen as piling on the pressure to sway Moldovans to change course. Moldova signed an EU association agreement along with Ukraine and Georgia In the summer, Moldova - along with Ukraine and Georgia - signed an association agreement, external on political and economic relations with the European Union. This angered Russia, which has called on Moldova to postpone the implementation of the free trade part of the deal, as Ukraine has since agreed to do. Moscow says it is worried by a flood of cheap EU goods affecting its producers, but some observers believe its goal is to assert what it sees as Russia's natural sphere of influence in the post-Soviet region. Russia has banned the import of agricultural products, including wine, meat, fruit and vegetables, dealing a severe blow to Moldova's economy - one of Europe's poorest, and heavily dependent on agricultural exports. President Putin has demanded a say in the implementation of Moldova's EU association agreement It has also made noises that it would support full independence for the Russian-backed breakaway region of Trans-Dniester if Moldova cosies up too closely to the West. The Ukraine crisis has intensified the longstanding rivalry between pro-EU and Russian-leaning parties. Local media accuse pro-Russian parties of being financed by Moscow, and one of them has been barred from taking part in the election for alleged foreign funding. Moldovans, usually split over Europe, have recently leaned towards favouring closer ties with the EU The authorities have banned the broadcasting of several Russian state TV channels, accusing them of propaganda. The opposition says the move violates media freedom. Of the two governing parties, Prime Minister Iurie Leanca's Liberal Democratic Party - which is still led by Mr Leanca's predecessor, Vlad Filat - wants Moldova to achieve EU candidate status by 2017 and full membership by 2020. It has ruled out any coalition deals with the pro-Russian opposition. Iurie Leanca took over as PM after his party colleague Vlad Filat resigned amid a corruption scandal in 2013 Its coalition partner, the Democratic Party, which is controlled by tycoon Vlad Plahotniuc, is more moderately pro-European. It enjoys positive media coverage. Mr Plahotniuc is said to have a stake in two major TV channels. The most strongly pro-EU and pro-Nato party, the Liberals, left the ruling coalition and went into opposition in 2013. The main opposition party is the Communist Party - a Soviet-era survivor that still uses the hammer and sickle as its symbol. Communist leader Vladimir Voronin served as president from 2001 until 2009 While it insists it is not fundamentally opposed to EU integration, it has called for a review of the association agreement. More recently, its leader, Vladimir Voronin, has suggested that the Russian-led Eurasian Union offers more benefits. Seen as rather staid, the Communists had been expected to lose votes to more radical, pro-Russian groups - Fatherland, and the Party of Socialists, which condemned the EU deal as ""criminal"". Their poll numbers were boosted by populist campaigning - including concerts by Russian pop singers. But with only days to go until the vote, the electoral authorities had Fatherland excluded from the election, accusing it of receiving funding ""from abroad"". The party's leader, millionaire Renato Usatii, who denies the allegation, left Moldova for Russia, saying he feared arrest. Voters will elect a single-chamber 101-member parliament by a system of proportional representation. Parties need to gain at least 6% of the vote to win seats. Sandwiched between Ukraine and the rest of Moldova, Trans-Dniester hosts 1,500 Russian troops A majority in parliament is needed to form a government. Parliament also elects the president, but this will not happen until President Nicolae Timofti's term ends in 2016. As in past elections, the breakaway Trans-Dniester region is not taking part. All Moldovans over 18 are eligible to vote - about 2.7 million people. An estimated 700,000 Moldovans work abroad, mostly in Russia. Opposition parties have accused the authorities of trying to prevent Russia-based voters from taking part by failing to set up enough polling places there. The latest opinion polls give pro-EU forces the lead, but much will depend on the groups' exact strength and post-election horse-trading. The process can be difficult; parliament was once unable to elect a president for three years. While a coalition of pro-EU parties seems the most likely outcome, there has been speculation that the Democrats and Communists - the moderate wings of the two sides - could work together.

geopolitical tensions,US-China tensions flare at UN General Assembly,2024-09-15,2020-09-22,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-54253408,"Tensions between the US and China came to the fore of the annual UN General Assembly in New York, with US President Donald Trump blaming China for the spread of coronavirus. He called for China to be held ""accountable"" for the pandemic.   In his speech, Chinese President Xi Jinping said his country had ""no intention to enter a Cold War with any country"". Ties between the two world powers are strained on a number of fronts. This year's summit at New York is largely being held virtually, with world leaders providing pre-recorded speeches. The new format meant some of the geopolitical theatre normally on offer at the key UN meeting was absent. Each country was represented by a single delegate and there was little opportunity for one nation to rebut another.  But as often is the case for speeches to the assembly, President Trump used his address to tout his achievements and tear into a rival. ""We must hold accountable the nation which unleashed this plague on to the world - China,"" he said.  ""In the earliest days of the virus China locked down travel domestically, while allowing flights to leave China and infect the world. China condemned my travel ban on their country, even as they cancelled domestic flights and locked citizens in their homes,"" he added.  President Trump, whose own record on coronavirus is under close scrutiny as the US heads towards elections, has frequently accused Beijing of covering up the virus, saying they could have stopped the disease spreading. China has called the attacks an unfounded distraction. The US death toll for coronavirus, at more than 200,000, is the highest in the world and President Trump has often downplayed the disease.  Tensions are high between the US and China on a number of other issues, including trade, technology, Hong Kong and China's treatment of Muslim minorities in Xinjiang province.  Speaking soon after the US leader, President Xi warned of the risks of a ""clash of civilisations"". ""We will continue to narrow differences and resolve disputes with others through dialogue and negotiation. We will not seek to develop only ourselves or engage in zero sum game,"" he said.  In remarks released ahead of Tuesday's speech, President Xi took a more overt swipe at the US, saying ""no country has the right to dominate global affairs, control the destiny of others, or keep advantages in development all to itself"", something China itself has been accused of by critics.   Also in his speech, President Xi said China - the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases - aims to hit peak emissions in 2030 and be carbon neutral by 2060.  By Laura Trevelyan, BBC News This was a stump speech by President Trump, who faces re-election in 40 days time. He had Beijing firmly in his sights - blaming what he and his followers call the China virus for taking countless lives.  Mr Trump is trying to deflect attention from his own handling of the pandemic by heaping opprobrium on China, while emphasising US efforts to find a cure.  We will end the pandemic, the president pledged, saying thanks to US efforts three vaccines are in the final stage of development. For good measure, Mr Trump lumped the UN's World Health Organization into his critique of China - saying the international body, which he's withdrawing US funding from, is virtually controlled by China, blaming it for spreading what he called misinformation about the virus.  This was not a subtle speech. It was a clear attempt to shift blame as Americans are already voting in the presidential election. The assembly was opened by UN Secretary-General António Guterres, who, without naming China or the US warned ""we must do everything to avoid a new Cold War"". ""We are moving in a very dangerous direction,"" he said. ""Our world cannot afford a future where the two largest economies split the globe in a great fracture - each with its own trade and financial rules and internet and artificial intelligence capacities."" He said there was no room for self-interest in the face of the coronavirus. ""Populism and nationalism have failed,"" he said. ""Those approaches to contain the virus have often made things manifestly worse."" President Trump gave a very different vision in his speech, saying ""only when you take care of your own citizens will you find a true basis for co-operation"".  In other speeches:"
geopolitical tensions,"Korea talks: Finally, a bit of optimism",2024-09-15,2018-01-05,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-42574423,"The first inter-Korean talks since 2015 are due to take place next week, but the optimism surrounding them could be fleeting, writes Ankit Panda, senior editor at The Diplomat. For close observers of the Korean peninsula and north-east Asian security, 2017 was dispiriting.  North Korea flight-tested more than 20 ballistic missiles, introducing several kinds of new and advanced long-range ballistic missiles. They include two intercontinental ballistic missiles that can reach the US carrying a nuclear payload. They also carried out their sixth and most powerful nuclear test.  The first days of 2018, however, give cautious cause for optimism.  Following North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un's new year offer to South Korea to discuss participation in the upcoming Winter Olympic Games in South Korea, inter-Korean diplomacy is set to resume for the first time since December 2015. Early on Friday morning, North Korea notified South Korea's unification ministry that it would send a representative for bilateral talks at Panmunjom in the heavily guarded demilitarised zone (DMZ), where the armistice ending the Korean War was signed and where most North-South interactions take place.  Pyongyang's acceptance of South Korea's overtures means diplomacy now has more momentum than at any time since since US President Donald Trump took office. Adding to the good vibes, shortly before North Korea's acceptance of talks the US announced that it had agreed to a South Korean request to delay the joint military Key Resolve and Foal Eagle exercises until the conclusion of the Paralympic Games on 18 March.  South Korea asked for the delay amid concerns North Korea would stage some kind of provocation during the Winter Olympics. The North has long said the springtime Foal Eagle exercises - which involve the mass mobilisation of troops and heavy military assets - are a ruse for preventive war. All this suggests a calmer climate on the Korean Peninsula after a tempestuous 2017, but there remains cause for concern. Although delaying military exercises may appear to be a US concession, Pyongyang may demand more. During his new year address, Mr Kim explicitly said that South Korea ""should discontinue all the nuclear war drills they stage with outside forces"". Mr Kim may know this is asking too much, particularly given that his intercontinental ballistic missiles introduce the old Cold War spectre of ""decoupling"", whereby a direct threat to the US could reduce its willingness to commit to defending South Korea.  But the North Korean leader may still not see a delay as sufficient cause for inter-Korean bonhomie. Indeed, if his address suggested anything, it was that he senses he is in a position of strength after an incredibly successful year for his nuclear and ballistic missile programmes. With all that leverage, North Korea may make heavy demands at the negotiating table next week. Second, the focus next Tuesday at Panmunjom will be the participation of two North Korean figure skaters at the Winter Olympics. Concluding an agreement to facilitate their participation would no doubt make for a moment of inter-Korean closeness, but it is unclear where diplomacy might progress from there. Even at this moment of optimism, we must ask if we have already reached the high point for diplomacy on the Korean peninsula in 2018.  Should the Panmunjom talks succeed, we may see a geopolitically uneventful Winter Olympics, but North Korea may return to testing ballistic missiles as early as late March, as the US-South Korea exercises begin. For diplomacy to succeed in 2018, the US and South Korea will have to extend this brief window of opportunity. Unfortunately, Seoul and Washington will remain divided on the correct path ahead.  While South Korean President Moon Jae-in has long been disposed toward engagement with the North, the Trump administration may see no alternative to doubling down on its policy of ""maximum pressure"", refusing to cede an inch. Potentially fatal to a springtime détente would be continued mixed messaging and boorish rhetoric from the US president.  Mr Trump has bragged about the size of his ""nuclear button"" compared with Mr Kim's and also applauded the inter-Korean talks as a positive development. With the Trump administration a year into office and senior Asia roles within the US foreign policy bureaucracy slowly being filled, Washington must be ready to stand alongside Seoul as it approaches North Korea without losing sight of its long-term objective of denuclearising the Korean peninsula.  In 2017, Mr Moon showed remarkable pragmatism in approaching North Korea alongside Washington and now it is time for the US to play a similar role. Should the allies themselves find little common ground, it is more likely than not that this moment of diplomatic optimism on the peninsula will be fleeting.

geopolitical tensions,1.9 billion people rely on natural 'water towers',2024-09-15,2019-12-09,By Jonathan Amos,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-50707138,"In a unique study, scientists have assessed and ranked the importance of Earth's great ""water towers"".  These are the 78 mountainous regions that are able to generate and then store vast quantities of water. They deliver it in a controlled way to major populations living downstream.  The Dutch-led team finds Asia's Indus basin - fed by the Himalayan, Karakoram, Hindu-Kush, and Ladakh ranges - to be the most important storage unit on the planet. Its waters, produced at high elevation from rain and snow, and draining from lakes and glaciers, support more than 200 million people settled across parts of Afghanistan, China, India and Pakistan.   But the Indus water tower, the researchers point out, is also the most vulnerable on their list of 78.  It's subject to a range of current and future pressures, from ever greater demand - for more drinking water, for increased irrigation and industry, etc - to issues that could severely curtail supply. The latter will include geopolitical tensions, given the Indus intersects national boundaries; but the most obvious threat is climate change. A warming world will disrupt precipitation patterns and denude glaciers of their storage capacity. ""If, basically, the demand is higher but the supply decreases, then we really have a problem,"" said research team-member Dr Tobias Bolch from the University of St Andrews, UK. ""And this is, I think, one of the major strengths of our study - that we have looked closely at both sides, so the supply index and the demand index,"" he told BBC News. Dr Bolch is speaking here at the American Geophysical Union's Fall Meeting, the largest annual gathering of Earth scientists. His and colleagues' work is being published simultaneously in the journal Nature. The team conducted the assessment across the major continents, identifying what it regarded as the five most relied-upon, natural water tower systems in those regions:  Africa does not appear in this listing, principally because it is devoid of major glacier systems. Ice bodies do exist on the continent, in places such as on Mount Kilimanjaro and Mount Kenya, but their contribution to downstream catchments is limited. And one of the defining aspects of the towers is the way they are able to maintain essential water supplies to populations even in drought years through the steady melt of high-elevation ice in summer months.  What's clear from the study is just how much more vulnerable the Asian towers are compared with the rest of the world. Some of that has to do with projected future demand. Population growth in Asia will be much higher than in Europe, for instance. But in Asia, too, there are specific political stresses that will challenge the future reliability of towers. Examples include the Amu Darya and Syr Darya river basins. Their waters - again sourced from high-mountain glaciers - run through low-precipitation areas where there is intense competition for irrigation for agriculture. The much reduced size of the Aral Sea, which both rivers ultimately feed, is evidence of this. ""What we recommend in our study is that we should really recognise mountains as global assets of the Earth system, and that means mountain ranges should be at the top of political agendas, and dedicated policies should be developed,"" co-team leader Prof Walter Immerzeel from Utrecht University said.  ""We are only the scientists; we put out the numbers. But we've got very much better at that over the past two decades, so we can give really specific scientific background that can help for example to develop water treaties. We can aid the process."" Dr Bethan Davies, a team-member from Royal Holloway, University of London, commented: ""I think when we've talked about climate change and ice loss, a lot of the narrative has been around sea-level rise. But actually over the next 100 years, climate change is going to affect drinking water for people, water for power, water for agriculture - and in these water towers, we're talking about the supply to about 1.9 billion people. That's more than 20% of the world's population. ""We need to adopt urgent mitigation strategies or we will face severe water shortages,"" she told BBC News. The water towers study was supported by National Geographic and Rolex as part of their Perpetual Planet partnership. A portal allows users to explore the data and compare tower rankings.

geopolitical tensions,Australia provokes China anger over scrapped deals,2024-09-15,2021-04-22,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-56840299,"Australia has scrapped agreements tied to China's Belt and Road initiative, prompting anger from Beijing and adding further strain to tense relations between the countries.  The federal government used new powers to rip up two deals made between the state of Victoria and China.  Canberra said it was backing away from the agreements to protect Australia's national interest.  The Chinese embassy in Australia branded the move ""provocative"". It said the action by Canberra was ""bound to bring further damage to bilateral relations, and will only end up hurting itself.""  ""It further shows that the Australian government has no sincerity in improving China-Australia relations,"" a spokesperson said in a statement.  It is the first time Canberra has used the powers to veto deals made by states, local governments or public universities with foreign countries. The laws allow the government to cancel agreements deemed to threaten Australia's national interest. In addition to the China deals, Foreign Minister Marise Payne also scrapped agreements with Iran and Syria. They were a memorandum of understanding sealed between Victoria's education department and Iran, signed in 2004, and a 1999 scientific cooperation agreement signed with Syria.  Senator Payne said the four agreements were ""inconsistent with Australia's foreign policy or adverse to our foreign relations"". Speaking to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, she defended the government's decision and said she did not expect China to retaliate.  ""I think Australia is acting in our national interest, we are very careful and very considered in that approach,"" she told the AM radio programme. The Victoria state's decision to sign up to China's Belt and Road initiative, with two agreements in 2018 and 2019, drew criticism from the federal government, as well as then-US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. The sweeping infrastructure project - which aims to expand global trade links - has funded trains, roads, and ports in many countries, but has left some saddled with debt.  Seen as a bold bid by President Xi Jinping for geopolitical influence the US has been particularly critical of China's so-called ""debt diplomacy"". The move to cut ties with the initiative comes against backdrop of deteriorating tensions between Canberra and Beijing.  China is Australia's largest trading partner and before the pandemic, its biggest source of overseas university students. Relations have worsened in recent years, leading to diplomatic and trade ructions. Trade ties have been particularly strained since Australia first called for a rigorous investigation into the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic in April. Canberra has taken other steps to curtail China's influence in the country, including putting a ban on telecoms giant Huawei from building Australia's 5G network and tightening foreign investment laws.  Still, the Australian government has denied its new veto power is aimed at China. Senator Payne said local governments and publicly funded universities had notified her of more than 1,000 foreign deals. "
geopolitical tensions,Will Moldova choose EU or Putin?,2024-09-15,2014-11-29,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-30197671,"Between East and West - Russian dolls can be bought in Chisinau markets Sunday's electoral contest between pro-Russian and pro-Western forces in Moldova has taken on an unprecedented, wider significance in the shadow of the crisis in neighbouring Ukraine. The former Soviet republic's governing pro-Western coalition is seeking closer ties with the European Union, but the Russian government is seen as piling on the pressure to sway Moldovans to change course. Moldova signed an EU association agreement along with Ukraine and Georgia In the summer, Moldova - along with Ukraine and Georgia - signed an association agreement, external on political and economic relations with the European Union. This angered Russia, which has called on Moldova to postpone the implementation of the free trade part of the deal, as Ukraine has since agreed to do. Moscow says it is worried by a flood of cheap EU goods affecting its producers, but some observers believe its goal is to assert what it sees as Russia's natural sphere of influence in the post-Soviet region. Russia has banned the import of agricultural products, including wine, meat, fruit and vegetables, dealing a severe blow to Moldova's economy - one of Europe's poorest, and heavily dependent on agricultural exports. President Putin has demanded a say in the implementation of Moldova's EU association agreement It has also made noises that it would support full independence for the Russian-backed breakaway region of Trans-Dniester if Moldova cosies up too closely to the West. The Ukraine crisis has intensified the longstanding rivalry between pro-EU and Russian-leaning parties. Local media accuse pro-Russian parties of being financed by Moscow, and one of them has been barred from taking part in the election for alleged foreign funding. Moldovans, usually split over Europe, have recently leaned towards favouring closer ties with the EU The authorities have banned the broadcasting of several Russian state TV channels, accusing them of propaganda. The opposition says the move violates media freedom. Of the two governing parties, Prime Minister Iurie Leanca's Liberal Democratic Party - which is still led by Mr Leanca's predecessor, Vlad Filat - wants Moldova to achieve EU candidate status by 2017 and full membership by 2020. It has ruled out any coalition deals with the pro-Russian opposition. Iurie Leanca took over as PM after his party colleague Vlad Filat resigned amid a corruption scandal in 2013 Its coalition partner, the Democratic Party, which is controlled by tycoon Vlad Plahotniuc, is more moderately pro-European. It enjoys positive media coverage. Mr Plahotniuc is said to have a stake in two major TV channels. The most strongly pro-EU and pro-Nato party, the Liberals, left the ruling coalition and went into opposition in 2013. The main opposition party is the Communist Party - a Soviet-era survivor that still uses the hammer and sickle as its symbol. Communist leader Vladimir Voronin served as president from 2001 until 2009 While it insists it is not fundamentally opposed to EU integration, it has called for a review of the association agreement. More recently, its leader, Vladimir Voronin, has suggested that the Russian-led Eurasian Union offers more benefits.

geopolitical tensions,Drone strikes set Saudi oil facilities ablaze,2024-09-15,2019-09-14,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-49699429,"Drone attacks have set alight two major oil facilities run by the state-owned company Aramco in Saudi Arabia, state media say. Footage showed a huge blaze at Abqaiq, site of Aramco's largest oil processing plant, while a second drone attack started fires in the Khurais oilfield. The fires are now under control at both facilities, state media said. A spokesman for the Iran-aligned Houthi group in Yemen said it had deployed 10 drones in the attacks. The military spokesman, Yahya Sarea, told al-Masirah TV, which is owned by the Houthi movement and is based in Beirut, that further attacks could be expected in the future. He said Saturday's attack was one of the biggest operations the Houthi forces had undertaken inside Saudi Arabia and was carried out in ""co-operation with the honourable people inside the kingdom"". Saudi Arabia is said to be shutting down around half of its oil output, the Wall Street Journal reports.  Officials have not yet commented on who they think is behind the attacks.  ""At 04:00 (01:00 GMT), the industrial security teams of Aramco started dealing with fires at two of its facilities in Abqaiq and Khurais as a result of... drones,"" the official Saudi Press Agency reported. ""The two fires have been controlled."" There have been no details on the damage but Agence France-Presse quoted interior ministry spokesman Mansour al-Turki as saying there were no casualties. Abqaiq is about 60km (37 miles) south-west of Dhahran in Saudi Arabia's Eastern Province, while Khurais, some 200km further south-west, has the country's second largest oilfield. Saudi security forces foiled an attempt by al-Qaeda to attack the Abqaiq facility with suicide bombers in 2006. Jonathan Marcus, BBC defence and diplomatic correspondent This latest attack underlines the strategic threat posed by the Houthis to Saudi Arabia's oil installations. The growing sophistication of the Houthis' drone operations is bound to renew the debate as to where this capability comes from. Have the Houthis simply weaponised commercial civilian drones or have they had significant assistance from Iran? The Trump administration is likely to point the finger squarely at Tehran, but experts vary in the extent to which they think Iran is facilitating the drone campaign. The Saudi Air Force has been pummelling targets in Yemen for years. Now the Houthis have a capable, if much more limited, ability to strike back. It shows that the era of armed drone operations being restricted to a handful of major nations is now over. Drone technology - albeit of varying degrees of sophistication - is available to all; from the US to  China, Israel and Iran... and from the Houthis to Hezbolllah. Analysis by BBC business correspondent Katie Prescott Aramco ranks as the world's largest oil business and these facilities are significant.  The Khurais oilfield produces about 1% of the world's oil and Abqaiq is the company's largest facility - with the capacity to process 7% of the global supply. Even a brief or partial disruption could affect the company, and the oil supply, given their size. But whether this will have an impact on the oil price come Monday will depend on just how extensive the damage is. Markets now have the weekend to digest information from Aramco and assess the long-term impact. According to Richard Mallinson, geopolitical analyst at Energy Aspects, any reaction on Monday morning is likely to be muted, as markets are less worried about supply than demand at the moment, due to slower global economic growth and the ongoing trade war between the US and China. However, there are concerns that escalating tensions in the region could pose a broader risk, potentially threatening the fifth of the world's oil supply that goes through the critical Strait of Hormuz. The Iran-aligned Houthi rebel movement has been fighting the Yemeni government and a Saudi-led coalition. Yemen has been at war since 2015, when President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi was forced to flee the capital Sanaa by the Houthis. Saudi Arabia backs President Hadi, and has led a coalition of regional countries against the rebels. The coalition launches air strikes almost every day, while the Houthis often fire missiles into Saudi Arabia. Mr Sarea, the Houthi group's military spokesman, told al-Masirah that operations against Saudi targets would ""only grow wider and will be more painful than before, so long as their aggression and blockade continues"". Houthi fighters were blamed for drone attacks on the Shaybah natural gas liquefaction facility last month and on other oil facilities in May. There have been other sources of tension in the region, often stemming from the rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Saudi Arabia and the US both blamed Iran for attacks in the Gulf on two oil tankers in June and July, allegations Tehran denied. In May, four tankers, two of them Saudi-flagged, were damaged by explosions within the UAE's territorial waters in the Gulf of Oman. Saudi Arabia and then US National Security Adviser John Bolton blamed Iran. Tehran said the accusations were ""ridiculous"". Tension in the vital shipping lanes worsened when Iran shot down a US surveillance drone over the Strait of Hormuz in June, leading a month later to the Pentagon announcing the deployment of US troops to Saudi Arabia."
geopolitical tensions,What do young Americans admire about Russia?,2024-09-15,2021-06-15,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-57421275,"For the first time since Joe Biden took office as US president, he will meet in person with Russian leader Vladimir Putin on Wednesday. The summit in Geneva, Switzerland, comes as both sides have acknowledged relations are at a new low. Here's what three young Americans and three young Russians told us about the other country. An independent who strongly aligns with progressive values, Connor is a college student who has been ""very pleased"" with his vote for President Biden so far.  Do you view Russia as an adversary or potential partner? I view the Russian government as an adversary and I believe certain conditions should be met in order for the United States to consider partnering with Putin's Russia. These conditions should require that Russia cease the imprisonment of journalists and opposition leaders. Additionally, Russia must agree to cease aggression with their southern and western neighbours. What do you think the two countries could work together on? With Russia and the United States having the first and second largest nuclear weapon stockpiles in the world, more joint denuclearisation treaties would be fantastic. I believe this joint mission is very important because it reduces the likelihood of accidents and creates an atmosphere of mutual trust. In the realm of trade, as the North Pole continues to melt, this opens an extremely fast new sea route. It would be great to see the US and Russia jointly ensure the safe passage of trade vessels.  Is there anything about Russia you admire that the US doesn't have? I greatly admire the spirit of the Russian people. They have withstood a dark and strenuous 150 years and have persevered throughout, despite all the while contending with despotic national leadership.  Americans and Russians are bonded by a history of revolution, social unrest, and vast technological progress. I hope our shared history can allow us to come to a greater understanding of one another and bring about an era of reconciliation rather than escalation. A final year student at Moscow State University, Viktor has aspirations of working as an interpreter in the future. He believes the two countries should be working together on a range of issues. Do you view the US as an adversary or potential partner? Unfortunately, right now Russia and the US are seen mostly as foes. But I am convinced that our countries can and should become friends. They are two large nuclear powers, who have huge influence over their respective continents. Their cooperation and peaceful coexistence is in the interest of the whole world.  What do you think the two countries could work together on? Russia and the US should be cooperating in as many areas as possible. The most important ones, in my view, are military security, arms control and fighting terrorism. But also in education, academic exchange programmes, technology and innovations, and fighting infectious diseases. Is there anything about the US you admire that Russia doesn't have? I most admire about the US their attitude towards protecting their nature - their national parks, as well as support of internal tourism and creating infrastructure to strengthen it. I also admire how they develop international contacts in the academic sphere and how skilled they are at attracting talent and investment from other countries.  Gabrielle is a moderate Republican who voted for Joe Biden, but has been ""increasingly frustrated"" by his administration's policies and priorities. Do you view Russia as an adversary or potential partner? Point blank, Russia and Vladimir Putin are intense adversaries of the United States. The global order is stronger if Russia is fiercely committed to liberal democracy, but it has proved time and time again that is not the case. Instead, it has consistently preyed upon Nato tensions and is looking to expand Russian occupation of Ukraine and the Balkans. Continuous cyberattacks, undermining confidence in elections and acts of aggression have proven that Russia has no interest in protecting or working with any country.  What do you think the two countries could work together on? Given the role of Russia as a leading natural gas producer, it is vital that the United States and Russia strive to work together on clean and alternative energy sources. Steps must be taken towards transition for the future wellbeing of both countries and their economies.  Over reliance on oil is both a national and regional security threat, emphasising the need for global investment and partnership on alternative clean energy sources for continued global prosperity.  Is there anything about Russia you admire that the US doesn't have? While its citizens remain fiercely committed to democracy and freedom, the government consistently undermines them. I admire the fire and want for freedom and prosperity of the Russian people, and fiercely condemn the actions and corruption of the Russian government.  Alena organises media campaigns for charities. She believes Russia and the US should be partners but is sceptical of whether it is possible at present, given the tension between the two countries. Do you view the US as an adversary or potential partner? I am a pacifist and I'm against the escalation of geopolitical tensions, so I would say the US is a friend. If we, Russia, work at building friendly contacts with the US, and they do the same towards us, then our mutual cooperation will at the very least decrease international tension.  What do you think the two countries could work together on? First of all, on nuclear disarmament, on the development of technology and on cooperation in space, but also in science and education. Is there anything about the US you admire that Russia doesn't have? I can't answer this very easily, as I follow European politics and the countries of the EU more closely. Gordon is an aerospace engineer in Salt Lake City and a conservative voter who says he feels optimistic about the state of American politics. Do you view Russia as an adversary or potential partner? Currently, I see Russia more as an adversary, largely because of President Putin. It's hard to completely decipher what has been specifically ordered by President Putin and what he chooses to allow adversarial third parties within Russia to do. In either case, he bears much of the responsibility. The recent cyber attacks, thought to originate from Russian groups, have only increased tensions.  What do you think the two countries could work together on? I think just about the only thing the two countries can work on together is a new nuclear arms treaty that will include other nuclear powers such as China. There seems to be some willingness on that front from both sides. The difficult thing is that both countries have very different goals and allies, which often puts them at odds with each other. Is there anything about Russia you admire that the US doesn't have? I love the Russian culture and people. They have a rich history and still are a major influence in Europe and around the world. A professional photographer and self-described pacifist, Katya says the two countries need to focus on fighting Covid-19 together even though they are enemies. Do you view the US as an adversary or potential partner? I think that Russia considers the US a foe, but the US isn't concerned about this as it has its own problems and concerns. And you can hardly have friends in politics. What do you think the two countries could work together on? Right now, I would say the most important thing is cooperation in fighting the coronavirus pandemic and in restoring the global economy. Is there anything about the US you admire that Russia doesn't have? I am attracted to the people's openness to each other and their tolerance. But I'm not saying that is completely universal in the US. Interviews by Sam Cabral of BBC North America and Alexey Ilin of BBC Russian"
geopolitical tensions,Gold hits record high as investor jitters spread,2024-09-15,2020-07-27,By Rebecca Marston,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-53555771,"Gold hit a record high on Monday as increasing numbers of nervous investors sought a safe place to put their money.  Rising political tensions between the US and China joined the ever-present worries over the continuing coronavirus pandemic to boost the spot price to $1,944.92 an ounce,  Covid-19 cases have risen to more than 16 million globally. Many investors shun gold as it does not pay dividends or earn interest, but its price tends to rise in troubled times,  Interest rates are currently near zero and dividend returns from companies are uncertain at best, with so many struggling. So far this year, gold prices have risen 28%. As well as lacking in returns, investing in gold brings costs. Adrian Ash, director of research at precious metals trader BullionVault, says storage costs (with insurance included) are 0.12% of the size of your investment per year.  Each bar weighs 400 Troy ounces (12.5kg) and is currently worth £600,000 at today's prices, so that would cost about £60 per month. It is trading in these large bars that creates the ""spot"" price.  The bars are how the wholesale industrial and investment gold markets move metal around, and any other form of gold you buy - whether a bracelet or a coin or the microchips in your smartphone - starts out in this larger form, adding costs at every stage of manufacture. However, Mr Ash says that if you fancy visiting your haul, you cannot. ""It's hard to over-state the level of security at professional bullion vaults, and for the vast majority of people, being shown a shiny yellow brick wouldn't prove much anyway."" He says his customers can take their metal out from the vault if they wish. ""We would arrange delivery, most usually in the form of smaller bars, although that necessarily triggers the extra manufacturing and shipping costs you otherwise avoid by owning wholesale bullion inside secure storage."" Unlike shares and bonds, investors in physical gold products do not get any return on their investment. There are no dividends or interest rates and no protection against inflation. Plus you pay to store it. The value simply rises and falls on investor demand.  A fall in the value of the dollar is another factor that boosts the price of gold, which is quoted in the US currency. It means that buyers using other currencies can, in fact, be paying the same for their gold, as they are able to buy more dollars for their money. The dollar index - which measures its value against a range of currencies - has fallen to its lowest since September 2018 following increasing tensions between the US and China. China took over the premises of the US consulate in the south western city of Chengdu. The move was in retaliation for the US closing down China's diplomatic base in Houston, Texas. Later this week, the US central bank, meets to decide on monetary policy. Mihir Kapadia, head of Sun Global Investments, thinks that could also help boost the gold price further. ""With eyes on the upcoming Fed policy meeting later this week and more concerns over geopolitical tensions, further gains can be expected with these factors likely to weigh heavily on the stock markets for a few more weeks to come."" The price of fellow precious metal silver was also higher. It rose more than 6% to $24.36 per ounce, its highest since September 2013."
geopolitical tensions,What happens to US citizens detained in North Korea,2024-09-15,2023-07-18,By Bernd Debusmann Jr ,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66236989,"Since the guns of the Korean War fell silent on 27 July 1953, tens of thousands of US troops have remained in South Korea to cast a wary eye across the 38th parallel to North Korea.  Together with their South Korean allies, US forces regularly conduct large-scale military drills on the peninsula, frequently drawing angry rebukes from Pyongyang's government. But despite these tensions and a lack of formal diplomatic relations between the US and North Korea, a small but steady stream of Americans have visited the country on organised tours - sometimes with dangerous results.  ""Do not travel to North Korea due to the continuing serious risk of arrest and long-term detention of US nationals,"" reads a sternly worded travel warning on the US State Department's website. ""The US government is unable to provide emergency services to US citizens in North Korea.""  US citizens have been detained in North Korea several times since 1996, including tourists, scholars and journalists.  In July 2017, the US government banned US citizens from visiting the country - a move that has since been extended until at least August this year.  Here are some of the most notable cases from the last decade.  Otto Warmbier, a student at the University of Virginia, was arrested while visiting North Korea as part of a tour group in January 2016. The visit, organised by a China-based budget tour operator that specialises in off-the-beaten-track destinations, was a five-day trip to experience North Korea during the New Year's Eve period. His father later told the Washington Post that he was ""curious about their culture"" and ""wanted to meet the people of North Korea"".  About two months after his detention on 2 January, a North Korean court sentenced Otto Warmbier to 15 years' imprisonment with hard labour on charges that he attempted to steal a propaganda poster.  Shortly after the sentencing, Mr Warmbier suffered a neurological injury under unclear circumstances.  He was freed - seriously ill - 17 months after his arrest, and died in a hospital six days after returning to the US in June 2017.  US doctors described Mr Warmbier as being in a state of ""unresponsive wakefulness"", but the Warmbier family said calling this a coma was ""unfair"". His father said when they saw his son he was ""moving around, and jerking violently, making these howling and inhuman sounds"". His head was shaved, he was blind and deaf, his arms and legs were ""totally deformed"" and he had a huge scar on his foot, he said. It ""looked like someone had taken a pair of pliers and rearranged his bottom teeth"". ""Otto was systematically tortured and intentionally injured by Kim and his regime. This was no accident,"" his father said. A US federal court later found North Korea liable for Otto Warmbier's torture and death.  While North Korea did not formally contest the charges, it has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.  The state-run Korean Central News Agency claimed he was provided medical care ""with all sincerity"" despite having ""no reason to show mercy to such a criminal of the enemy state"".  It also claimed that North Korea was ""the biggest victim"" of the death and subsequent ""smear campaign"" by the US.  In October 2018, North Korea announced that Bruce Byron Lowrance - a 60-year-old from Michigan - had been detained while entering the country illegally from China.   US authorities later revealed that a man matching his name and description had been detained at the demilitarised zone separating North and South Korea. The man had allegedly told investigators that he believed that his visit would help ease geopolitical tensions between the two countries.  Mr Lowrance was released about a month after being detained, which US officials suggested may have been an effort to improve relations with the US following high-profile talks between Kim Jong Un and then US President Donald Trump.  He has not commented publicly on his detention and subsequent release. Matthew Miller, a 24-year-old teacher from California, was taken into custody by North Korean authorities and charged with ""hostile"" espionage acts while on an organised tour in April 2014.  North Korean authorities later alleged he admitted to a ""wild ambition"" of exploring the country and investigating conditions there.  He was sentenced to six years' imprisonment with hard labour in September 2014. In interviews before and after his release, he said he spent much of his time digging in fields, moving stones and taking out weeds, but was otherwise largely kept in strict isolation.  Mr Miller was released the following month with another American detainee, Kenneth Bae.  In a later interview with journalist Nate Thayer of the North Korea-focused NK News site, Mr Miller said he went to North Korea with the intention of defecting and getting to ""speak to an ordinary North Korean person about normal things"", regardless of politics.  ""I was trying to stay in the country,"" Mr Miller said. ""They wanted me to leave. The very first night they said, 'We want you to leave on the next flight.' But I refused. I just did not leave.""  In the interview, Mr Miller said he eventually ""changed his mind"" about seeking asylum and requested help from the US government.  The man released with Mr Miller, Washington state resident Kenneth Bae, was arrested in November 2012. A Korean-American Evangelical Christian missionary, he had visited the country many times. On this occasion he was stopped and a hard drive with Christian material was discovered. North Korea levelled an array of charges for what it called Mr Bae's ""hostile acts"" including attempting to establish bases for anti-government activities, smuggling in forbidden literature, and encouraging dissidents.  He was sentenced to 15 years with hard labour, with state media suggesting that he only escaped the death penalty as a result of a ""candid confession"".  During his time in captivity, his family said that his health deteriorated as a result of poor conditions and difficult labour. Part of his captivity was spent in a labour camp for foreigners in which he was the only inmate.  Mr Bae was released and returned to the US along with Mr Miller following a secret visit to Pyongyang by Director of National Intelligence James Clapper.  After his release, Mr Bae wrote a memoir, ""Not Forgotten: The True Story of My Imprisonment in North Korea"" in which he said that he was interrogated from 08:00 in the morning until 22:00 or 23:00 at night every day for the first four weeks of his imprisonment. His interrogators demanded hundreds of pages of confessions. He said one interrogator kept telling him: ""No-one remembers you. You have been forgotten by people, your government. You're not going home anytime soon. You'll be here for 15 years. You'll be 60 before you go home"". In March 2009, North Korea arrested two California-based journalists, Eura Lee and Laura Ling, who were filming a documentary about humanitarian conditions on China's border with North Korea. Two other members of their crew, a US cameraman and a Chinese guide, escaped and were briefly detained by Chinese authorities.   Ms Ling later acknowledged they crossed the border, although she said they spent less than a minute in North Korea before attempting to turn back into China.   Ms Lee and Ms Ling were soon charged with crossing the border illegally and in June 2009 were sentenced to 12 years imprisonment and hard labour.  ""I had tried to prepare myself for a lengthy sentence but nothing could prepare me for the verdict,"" Ms Ling later told National Public Radio. ""I was wondering if those words meant that the window of opportunity had closed and my fate was sealed."" In August that year, however, both were released after a previously unannounced visit to Pyongyang by former President Bill Clinton. While the visit came amid a flurry of back channel negotiations between North Korea's government and the Obama administration, the White House said that Mr Clinton's visit was a ""solely private mission"".  ""No money was exchanged and no diplomacy was conducted,"" Ms Ling told NPR. ""It truly was a private humanitarian mission"". "
geopolitical tensions,World growth 'slowest since financial crisis',2024-09-15,2019-10-15,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50047929,"The global economy is growing at its slowest pace since the financial crisis, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said. The fund said world growth would hit just 3% this year - down from its July forecast of 3.2% and a sharp slowdown from just two years ago. The IMF blamed the slowdown on trade fights, Brexit uncertainty and other geopolitical crises. It added there is an ""urgent"" need for leaders to de-escalate the tensions. ""The global outlook remains precarious,"" the international lending body said in its annual report. ""At 3% growth, there is no room for policy mistakes."" The IMF, which downgraded its forecasts for most of the world, predicted that growth in advanced economies would slow from 2.3% in 2018 to 1.7% this year. In the US, where an economic boost from a 2017 tax cut has faded, the fund expects growth to pull back from 2.9% last year to 2.4% in 2019. In the UK, where Brexit-related worries have hurt investment, growth is forecast at 1.2% for 2019, down from 1.4% last year. In Germany, which is reeling from a downturn in car production, growth is predicted at 0.5%, down from 1.5% in 2018. China's economic growth is expected to slow from 6.6% to 6.1%. It has been hit by efforts to rein in risky debt and the trade war with the US, which led the IMF to shave almost a percentage point off global growth.  Thus far, the IMF said central banks have managed to blunt the impact of the slowdown with tools such as low interest rates. Without those stimulus policies, it estimates that the growth rate would have been 0.5 percentage points lower this year. ""With central banks having to spend limited ammunition to offset policy mistakes, they may have little left when the economy is in a tougher spot,"" the fund said.   The World Trade Organization also recently downgraded its economic outlook, citing trade wars, Brexit and other factors. The IMF said the global economy could grow faster in 2020, at 3.4%. However, it warned that risks are ""skewed to the downside"", noting that the pickup depends on improvements in India, as well as several economies currently under severe strain, such as Argentina, Turkey and Iran.  ""Policy missteps at this juncture, such as a no-deal Brexit or a further deepening of trade disputes, could severely undermine sentiment, growth, and job creation,"" it said. ""The foremost priority, in many cases, is to remove policy-induced uncertainty or threats to growth."" By Andrew Walker, BBC economics correspondent What can policymakers do to tackle the global economic slowdown? The commentary from the IMF's chief economist, Gita Gopinath, has something to say about three major policy tools. Trade policy is the obvious one. The IMF blames much of the weakening outlook on trade tensions so you would expect a call to reverse the tariff increases imposed by several countries, notably the US.  That does indeed top Ms Gopinath's list. Central banks have already taken steps - interest rate cuts and other measures. She describes these moves as spending limited ammunition to offset policy mistakes.  She warns that central banks may have little left when the economy is in a tougher spot. It's a worry that has been bubbling for several years before the recent escalation of trade tensions as central banks reached for new ideas in the aftermath of the global financial crisis.  Ms Gopinath argues this cannot be the ""only game in town"". Governments that can afford it - she mentions Germany, in particular - should cut taxes or increase spending. And she says if things get worse, an internationally co-ordinated response along these lines might be required. "
geopolitical tensions,What Putin's India visit means for world politics,2024-09-15,2021-12-06,By Vikas Pandey,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-59515741,"Visits by Russian presidents to India always invoke a sense of nostalgia. The Moscow-Delhi relationship dates back to the Cold War era and it has been strong ever since. This ""all-weather"" partnership is one of the success stories of global diplomacy, and a high mark for Russian President Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to live up to when they meet in Delhi on Monday. But beyond the big-ticket defence deals, trade announcements, handshakes and Mr Modi's trademark hugs, the two countries will also have to overcome serious challenges. And that is largely down to the different geopolitical choices the two countries have made in recent months and years. How they solve these issues will influence regional, and global politics.  Growing India-US relations is one irritant that has loomed large over Delhi-Moscow ties, more so in the past decade. Mr Modi even held a big rally for Donald Trump in 2020 when he visited India. It was a vibrant show of support for Washington. Moscow largely overlooked such irritants even though its own relations with Washington steadily deteriorated in recent years. But Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov chose to speak openly when  India joined the Quad - an alliance involving the US, Japan and Australia. The group said the Quad was a non-military alliance and wasn't aimed at a specific country, but Mr Lavrov didn't seem to agree. He said the West was ""trying to engage India in anti-China games by promoting Indo-Pacific strategies"". Former Indian diplomat Anil Trigunayat, who served in Moscow, says that the Quad is a red line for Russia and this will most definitely be part of the discussions between the two leaders. Moscow's worries about the Quad can be understood from its growing relations with Beijing in recent years. Mr Trigunayat adds that Russia has been compelled to forge closer ties with China to secure its economic and geopolitical interests in Asia as the US-led West also seeks to dominate the region. China's deteriorating ties with the US also appear to have pushed Beijing and Moscow closer.  What complicates the matter further is that India-China relations have been recently tense - troops from the two countries fought a deadly clash in Ladakh's Galwan Valley with clubs and stones which left 20 Indian soldiers dead. China later accepted that some of its soldiers also died in the clashes. Michael Kugelman, deputy director at the Wilson Center think-tank in Washington, says the new geopolitical realities pose a ""potential threat to the India-Russia relationship"". In this context, Mr Putin's visit is important to uphold the special relationship. ""I think for Russia, the objective in this case, is to reinforce the importance of Moscow's relations with New Delhi, even as the geopolitical signposts suggest otherwise,"" Mr Kugelman adds. But analysts, including Mr Kugleman and Mr Trigunayat, feel that the foundations of the relationship between the two countries are strong enough to address each other's concerns.  The countries have several areas where they can and will look to cooperate - Afghanistan is one of them.  It will most definitely be part of the discussion as Delhi tries to stay relevant in Afghanistan. Pakistan, India's neighbour and archrival, now has better strategic depth in Afghanistan as it appears to have formed an informal alliance with Russia, Iran and China. Moscow can help Delhi recover the lost ground in Afghanistan as the two have shared concerns about the future of the country.  ""Both Russia and India are wary of the Taliban and the Haqqani Network, and the potential for terrorism coming out of Afghanistan and impacting their countries, So, Afghanistan really is an area of strong agreements between New Delhi and Moscow,"" says Derek Grossman, senior defence analyst at the US-based RAND Corporation think-tank. India and Russia are already partners in several multinational forums like Brics (also involves Brazil, China, South Africa), the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (also involves China, Pakistan and Central Asian countries) and the RIC (Russia, India and China).  These forums give an opportunity to Moscow and Delhi to work together closely on both bilateral and global issues. And given China is a member in these forums, Moscow can use its influence, even if it's not done publicly, to ensure both Beijing and Delhi continue to engage with each other to maintain peace at their disputed border. The showpiece of the visit is likely to be the delivery of the Russia-made S-400 missile defence system to India. It's is one of the most sophisticated surface-to-air defence systems in the world. It has a range of 400km (248 miles) and can shoot down up to 80 targets simultaneously, aiming two missiles at each one. The system gives India crucial strategic deterrence against China and Pakistan, and that is the reason why it went ahead with the order despite threats of US sanctions.  Washington has put several Russian firms under sanctions. The Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (Caatsa) was introduced in 2017 to target Russia, Iran and North Korea with economic and political sanctions. It also prohibits any country from signing defence deals with these nations. While the deal may create tensions between the US and India, Moscow appears to be satisfied with Delhi's stand. It will be interesting to see how India balances ties with the two superpowers under the shadow of the S-400 deal. Indian diplomats feel the decision to buy S-400 also upholds India's famed practice of ""strategic autonomy"", adding that the US should respect that. Mr Trigunayat adds that India's large defence budget also gives it strategic advantage. ""Most global relationships are transactional and it's true for Moscow and Delhi as well,"" he adds. India is the world's second largest arms importer, accounting for about 10% of global defence trade, according to a report by the defence think-tank Sipri. Moscow continues to be India's largest arms supplier even though its share has dropped to 49% from 70% due to India's decision to diversify its portfolio and boost domestic defence manufacturing. The US was India's second-largest supplier between 2011 and 2015 after Russia but it fell behind France and Israel in the period between 2016 and 2021. Washington would want to do better and analysts say that gives India leverage.  Russia will also try to boost its defence export to India and some major deals could be announced on Monday. However, commercial trade between the two countries has remained far below their potential. Bilateral trade in 2019 (pre-pandemic levels) stood at $11bn and it was skewed in Russia's favour as it exported goods and services worth $7.24bn, according to a report from the Indian government. In comparison, India-US bilateral goods and services trade stood at $146bn in the same period.  Russia and India have now set a target of reaching $30bn in bilateral trade by the end of 2025. They will look to diversify their portfolio and go beyond energy and minerals. Education, cyber security, agriculture, railways, pharmaceuticals, and clean energy are some of the other areas they are likely to focus on.  India's decision to give $1bn line of credit to businesses to invest in Russia's Far East region will also help boost trade between the countries. Talks are also expected on the proposed Chennai-Vladivostok maritime corridor. The route will open more business frontiers.  Talks over a free trade agreement between India and the Russian-led Eurasian Economic Union are also likely to progress. If the deal happens, it will help businesses move goods easily between the two regions.  ""As long as trade, defence deals stay relevant, the two nations will find a way to sort out their geopolitics differences,"" Mr Kugelman adds. "
geopolitical tensions,The plan to make a giant hot water bottle underground,2024-09-15,2023-04-13,By Chris Baraniuk,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-65098792,"During the Cold War the vast caverns beneath the Swedish city of Västerås held a stockpile of oil totalling 300,000 cubic metres. The oil was there in case World War Three broke out and Sweden found itself cut off from international energy supplies.  In 1985, as geopolitical tensions began to ease, the caverns were emptied and have remained vacant - until now.  Swedish energy company Mälarenergi has embarked on a project to decontaminate the facility and fill it with hot water at temperatures of up to 95C. In essence, they are building a giant underground thermos, which the firm says will be the largest of its kind in Europe. ""It's quite damp,"" says Lisa Granström, acting head of business unit heat and power, describing her last visit to the tunnels, which are in an undisclosed location. ""[The caverns are] a lot warmer than you would expect. It smells a little bit oily, still."" The storage available is roughly equivalent to 120 Olympic-sized swimming pools and 11 times bigger than the largest above-ground hot water tank that Mälarenergi has nearby, adds Mrs Granström.  This type of thermal storage is just one of several ways of caching warmth in the ground for use later. With the rise of renewables and concerns about energy security in Europe following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, some experts argue that we should be making more of below-ground heat storage systems. In the case of Västerås, warmth from the caverns will be sent via heat exchangers to a district heating network, which supplies 98% of the households in the city of 130,000 people. Mälarenergi intends to begin filling the caverns with water by the end of the year. The facility will offer 500MW of district heating power.  Where does the heat come from, though? Burning things. The company has a nearby power plant with furnaces for combusting waste or biomass and turning it into electricity or thermal energy. Mrs Granström says that carbon capture technology, which would reduce harmful emissions from the plant, is not yet in place but that her firm is currently considering installing it. The hot water reservoir will allow Mälarenergi to continue heating homes on cold winter days when demand is high, without reducing electricity production at the power plant. Storing heat underground tends to work well because it is very hard for the heat to escape - the ground itself acts as one big insulator. Mrs Granström explains that Mälarenergi's caverns will retain heat for multiple weeks and the system ought to be particularly stable once a few years pass and the temperature of the adjacent ground rises. ""Once it's heated, the loss is not that great,"" she says. ""You've heated up the rocks around it."" This may chime with Londoners weary of sweaty journeys to and from work on the tube. For decades, heat from people and trains has been warming the clay that surrounds tunnels on the London Underground. So much so, that this clay now has an ambient temperature of between 20C and 25C, making it very difficult to cool down tube carriages and platforms on the network. The project in Västerås is not the first of its kind. In Finland, energy firm Helen began filling a slightly smaller cavern system on the island of Mustikkamaa with hot water back in 2021. The facility is now operational, the company says, and supplies heat to 25,000 one-bedroom apartments all year round. ""These cavern solutions being suggested, I think they're great,"" says Fleur Loveridge at the University of Leeds. ""They're just one option, if you like."" More technology of business: According to the UK's Coal Authority, a quarter of the British population lives above abandoned coal mines. Significant numbers of these mines are flooded and naturally maintain relatively warm temperatures, roughly around 15C, for example. This mine water could be heated up further, perhaps by a heat pump system, before being distributed along pipes to nearby houses, where it would warm radiators or provide hot water. Such a system could use heat exchangers to heat up a closed water loop so that potential contaminants from the mine water are not passed into the home supply.  Prof Loveridge points out that heating accounts for roughly a quarter of the UK's carbon emissions and decarbonizing heating is quite difficult. Millions of households still rely on fossil fuel boilers, for example. ""We should be, as a country, utilizing every option we have for thermal energy sources and stores,"" she says. But there's an alternative to giant thermos flasks underground - what about hot rocky sponges? Matthew Jackson at Imperial College London says that in the UK we might be able to make use of aquifers, porous bodies of rock underground that naturally retain water. It's possible to pump heat - or cold - into large areas of these ""sponges"" and then take the hot or cold out again via a fluid when required, to warm or cool down dwellings. Such a system could be even more efficient than hot water reservoirs in caverns, Prof Jackson says.  Despite numerous aquifer thermal energy storage installations in Europe - there are thousands in the Netherlands, for instance - it remains rare in the UK. ""That's a technology which is not that prevalent [here],"" says Prof Jackson. ""We have 11 installations operational at the moment."" One example is the luxury Chelsea Barracks complex in London, which is being redeveloped into a residential and commercial area. Between 2015 and 2018, an aquifer thermal energy storage system was installed by a Belgian company, AGT.  Aquifers suitable for this sort of thing are plentiful around the UK, however, and often conveniently located right under cities, notes Prof Jackson.  And yet, the UK is arguably falling behind on making use of underground thermal energy resources. ""The main barriers to deployment in the UK are not around technical suitability,"" says Prof Jackson. ""They're really around awareness of developers that this is a solution."""
geopolitical tensions,WHO to investigate Covid origins in China's Wuhan,2024-09-15,2020-12-16,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-55333200,"A team of 10 international scientists will travel to the Chinese city of Wuhan next month to investigate the origins of Covid-19, the World Health Organization (WHO) has said. Beijing has been reluctant to agree to an independent inquiry and it has taken many months of negotiations for the WHO to be allowed access to the city. The virus is thought to have come from a market in the city selling animals. But the search for the source has led to tensions, notably with the US. President Donald Trump's administration has accused China of trying to conceal the initial outbreak. A biologist on the team travelling to Wuhan told the Associated Press news agency that the WHO was not seeking to apportion blame, but rather to prevent future outbreaks. ""It's really not about finding a guilty country,"" Fabian Leendertz of Germany's Robert Koch Institute said.  ""It's about trying to understand what happened and then see if, based on those data, we can try to reduce the risk in the future."" Dr Leendertz said the aim was to find out when the virus began circulating and whether or not it originated in Wuhan. The mission was expected to last four or five weeks, he added. In the early days of the virus, it was traced to a so-called ""wet market"" in Wuhan, Hubei province, and it was suggested that this was where it made the leap from animals to humans. But experts now believe it may simply have been amplified there. Research suggests that coronaviruses capable of infecting humans may have been circulating undetected in bats for decades. Last December, a Chinese doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital - Li Wenliang - tried to warn fellow medics about a possible outbreak of a new disease, but was told by police to ""stop making false comments"" and was investigated for ""spreading rumours"". Dr Li died in February after contracting the virus while treating patients in the city. In April, suspicions and allegations emerged that the virus might have leaked from a laboratory in Wuhan.  US State Department cables came to light suggesting that embassy officials were worried about biosecurity there.  The office of the US national intelligence director said at the time that while the virus was not man-made or genetically modified, officials were investigating whether the outbreak began through contact with animals or through a laboratory accident. Recent reports in Chinese media have suggested that Covid-19 could have started outside China. But analysts say the reports are without foundation, and the campaign reflects anxiety within the leadership in Beijing about damage to the country's international reputation from the pandemic. Analysis by Naomi Grimley, BBC health correspondent The question of an independent inquiry into the origins of the virus has become embroiled in international geopolitics and rows about the WHO. The Trump administration has always taken a hard line, arguing that the WHO has been too soft on China and citing examples of officials praising the Chinese regime for its actions such as locking down Wuhan, mass testing and its publication of the genetic code of the virus. However, lots of other countries also said there needed to be a proper inquiry - including Australia and the UK. The Associated Press revealed transcripts of video calls from WHO officials complaining back in January that they had not received the right data they needed from the Chinese authorities. A two-man WHO team that visited China this summer had difficulty negotiating access to Wuhan. This trip, when it does happen, will probably concentrate on fundamental biological questions: did the virus originally come from bats? Was there an ""intermediate host"" linking bats to humans? And were Wuhan wet markets at the centre of the initial outbreak? China's tackling of the developing crisis was praised in January by the head of the WHO's Health Emergencies Programme, Dr Mike Ryan, who said the ""challenge is great but the response has been massive"".  Beijing had helped slow the spread of the virus, the WHO said, by quickly volunteering to share its knowledge of the virus's genetic code. However, the US - among a number of other countries - raised questions about whether China was fully transparent when the virus first emerged there. In March, the head of the WHO in China, Dr Gauden Galea, told the BBC there were ""shortcomings"" in tackling the outbreak in the early days, but that experts would look at how issues could be avoided in the future. Mr Trump later attacked the WHO itself for being too ""China-centric"" in praising Beijing, saying the organisation ""really blew it"" with its early guidance during the outbreak. He announced that he was pulling the US out of the body and said funding would be redirected elsewhere. However, US President-elect Joe Biden, who is due to be sworn in on 20 January, has since set up a foreign policy team tasked with keeping America in the WHO. "
geopolitical tensions,Ukraine war casts shadow over India's G20 ambitions,2024-09-15,2023-02-28,By Vikas Pandey,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-64781836,"India has been positioning itself as a leading voice of developing countries known as the Global South in recent years. Now, as president of the G20, Delhi could not have a bigger stage on which to deliver. The world's 19 wealthiest nations plus the European Union account for 85% of global economic output and two-thirds of its population.  But as its foreign ministers meet in Delhi, any broader agreements that India hopes to deliver will largely depend on one key factor: the war in Ukraine. When G20 leaders gathered last autumn in Bali, under Indonesia's presidency, Russian missiles hit key Ukrainian infrastructure targets as world leaders sat down for dinner. The joint communique clearly showed differences, with India, China and Russia reportedly not agreeing to unequivocal criticism of the invasion. Not much has changed since then: the war has continued with no sign of peace talks, the world remains as divided, if not more so, and many big economies are still in turmoil. Given this backdrop, it wasn't surprising when G20 finance ministers failed to agree on a closing statement after their meeting in Bangalore (Bengaluru) last week. Both Moscow and Beijing declined to accept parts of a closing statement that deplored Russia's aggression ""in the strongest terms"". It was left to India to release a chair's summary which noted ""different assessments of the situation"" in Ukraine within the group. The foreign ministers' talks this Wednesday and Thursday are likely to face similar hurdles. ""India is taking its G20 presidency very seriously. So it's going to pull out all the stops to try to make this a successful meeting. There will be a lot of symbolic flourishes. In terms of substance, the Ukraine issue will be looming over everything else,"" says Michael Kugelman, deputy director at the Wilson Center think-tank. India wants to focus on issues it sees as more urgent for the developing world. It has put climate change, the increasing burden of debt on developing nations, digital transformation, rising inflation and food and energy security on the agenda. Many economies are still struggling to recover from the pandemic and rising prices due to the war have made things worse. Experts say Delhi will need deft diplomacy to somehow make the group look beyond Ukraine - but agreements on issues seen as ""low hanging fruit"" are thought to be achievable. In that sense, Delhi will hope to use this week's talks to hit the ground running ahead of a leaders' summit in September.  ""India will try to work out a compromise statement that doesn't fully satisfy anybody, but that everybody can live with,"" says Jitendra Nath Misra, a former Indian ambassador and now a professor at OP Jindal Global University. ""But it's not going to be easy, as countries on either side of the war have only hardened their stands in the past few months.""  India's own position has come in for scrutiny and reproach too. It has refrained from directly criticising Russia, with which it has long-standing ties, while increasing imports of Russian oil. Delhi's non-aligned approach initially did not please Western powers but an understanding seems to have evolved.  India may not have criticised Russia directly but it has talked about the importance of ""the UN Charter, international law, and respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of states"" in its past statements on Ukraine. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's statement on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit last autumn was viewed as indirect criticism of Russia. ""Today's era is not of war,"" Mr Modi told the meeting in Uzbekistan in the presence of President Putin. Mr Kugelman thinks it's unlikely India will come under pressure to harden its stand against Russia at the G20 talks. But he points to other differences in the group that could derail India's ambitions. India's relations with China have been frosty due to tensions on their disputed border. The ""spy balloon"" controversy has further strained Beijing-Washington ties and the relationship between the West and Russia is ""as bad as ever"", he says. The atmosphere is going be tense when top diplomats from opposing sides meet in Delhi. So experts say Mr Modi and his foreign minister S Jaishankar will need to use all their personal relations and diplomatic skills if they are to avoid rivalries affecting outcomes at the talks. ""Delhi prides itself on its ability to balance rival relationships but given the extent and the scale of the bitterness and geopolitical tensions within this group, it will have to work harder,"" Mr Kugelman says. ""But India has shown before that it's capable of navigating a number of different geopolitical rivalries."" Delhi will also be under pressure to deliver results domestically - it's invested heavily in promoting a G20 summit taking place in the ""mother of democracies"" under Mr Modi's leadership. He will want to show he has been able to make India's position stronger in the world, especially in the run-up to campaigning for next year's general elections.  ""India is trying all the ways it can muster to have meetings all over the country to make people at home aware of the G20. That's all very good, but it does not resolve the basic strategic dilemma that India faces right now on how to not let the war disrupt its ambitions,"" says Mr Misra. For Mr Kugelman, India sees itself as a bridge between the developed and the developing worlds, and wants to use its G20 presidency to play the ""middle power"". ""Now we have a leader who can put them back on the map as a world leader, and they're trying to connect the G20 to that."" But he says ""the challenge is cut out"" for India. ""How does it separate the so-called radioactive issues from things where tangible agreements can be found?"" BBC News India is now on YouTube.

geopolitical tensions,Lithuania closes two Belarus border crossings,2024-09-15,2023-08-16,By George Wright,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66525148,"Lithuania is to close two of its six border crossings with Belarus. The two rural crossing points, which are not used by commercial vehicles, will be closed from Friday. The government said the decision was in response to changes in the geopolitical situation and threats to national security, as well as smuggling.  Belarus's western neighbours have increased security since Minsk granted shelter to fighters from Russia's Wagner mercenary group. This came as part of a deal to end a brief mutiny in Russia by Wagner in June. The Lithuanian government said the crossings at Tverecius and Sumskas will be closed, and traffic will be diverted to Medininkai, the largest of its six checkpoints. Deputy Minister of Transport Agnė Vaiciukeviciute told the Associated Press that the closures were temporary. Poland has also sharply restricted access from Belarus, and on Tuesday, Latvia ordered reinforcements to its border.   Latvian PM Krisjanis Karins said Belarus needed to know his country was serious about securing its borders for the good of its own people, and the rest of Europe. ""We have seen that this summer the pressure from Belarus is not decreasing, but gradually increasing,"" Mr Karins said.  ""We are simply increasing our presence and sending a clear signal to both our own society and the Belarusian authorities that this is no joke."" Poland announced last week it was sending 10,000 extra troops to its border with Belarus following an alleged incursion by Belarusian military helicopters. Its government says they'll help to guard against mercenaries from Russia's Wagner group who have moved to Belarus after Polish PM Mateusz Morawiecki warned that Wagner fighters could pose as migrants and enter the EU. Concerns have been rising among the neighbours of Belarus - a close ally of Russia - since June, when a mutiny by Wagner challenged President Vladimir Putin's authority. A deal ended a 24-hour rebellion, which saw the troops seize the southern Russian city of Rostov and march on Moscow - aborting the march just 200km (124 miles) from the capital. Under the agreement, Wagner fighters were told they could either join the regular Russian army or go to Belarus."
geopolitical tensions,Why Iran gave the US flowers in 1998 World Cup clash,2024-09-15,2022-11-29,By Bernd Debusmann Jr,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-63797316,"Amid harsh barbs and heated geopolitics, the last World Cup match-up between Iran and the United States began with an unlikely gesture - bouquets of white flowers.  The flowers, Iran's coach later said, were meant as a symbol of peace ahead of the 1998 showdown in France.  Two decades later, political tensions were again high ahead of the Iran-US game in Qatar.  The latest meeting, however, went without any friendly gestures.  The previous match, held in Lyon, came 20 years after diplomatic relations between the two nations were severed as a result of the storming of the US embassy in Tehran in 1979 and subsequent 444 day hostage crisis.  Just one month before kick-off, the US State Department labelled Iran the world's ""most active"" state sponsor of terrorism, while several high-level Iranian officials kept up a steady drumbeat of anti-US rhetoric.  Despite the tensions evident in the halls of the United Nations and in the Persian Gulf, Iran's players - led by California-based manager Jalal Talebi - decided to start the match with a signal that the only competition between the two would be on the pitch.  ""We decided to make something special,"" Mr Talebi said in an oral history of the match produced by ESPN.  ""Let us go inside and give them nice flowers to say that we are here for peace. We are not here for fighting or anything.""  The US team reciprocated, giving their opponents US Soccer Federation (USSF) pennants. Together, the squads posed for a group picture, with many of the players smiling ahead of the high-pressure match.  ""I thought that was great,"" Cobi Jones, then a midfielder for the US team, said in the ESPN report.  ""It's just like a sign of like sport trumping politics and all that. That was very important and having the mixed photo was great.""   The days leading up to the World Cup rematch on Tuesday between the two teams were once again marked by tensions, coming amid widespread anti-government protests in Iran and just after the USSF removed the emblem of the Islamic Republican from the flag it posted in online graphics.  The pictures were later deleted, and US manager Gregg Berhalter apologised, saying that ""sometimes things are out of our control"" and that he and the US team were only focused on football.  The US team went into the match hoping to avoid a repeat of the 1998 game, which ended with a 2-1 victory for Iran, though both countries were eliminated from the tournament after the game.  Alexi Lalas, a Fox Sports commentator who was a member of the 1998 team, told the Associated Press that the current US team would be well advised not to ignore the wider geopolitics surrounding the current match.  ""Understanding the importance of this game, not just from a soccer perspective but from a cultural perspective, I think is crucial for the United States,"" he said, addressing what would motivate the US on the pitch.  The US-Iran match in Qatar ended 1-0 in the Americans' favour after a goal from Christian Pulisic in the 38th minute. "
geopolitical tensions,"Korea talks: Finally, a bit of optimism",2024-09-15,2018-01-05,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-42574423,"The first inter-Korean talks since 2015 are due to take place next week, but the optimism surrounding them could be fleeting, writes Ankit Panda, senior editor at The Diplomat. For close observers of the Korean peninsula and north-east Asian security, 2017 was dispiriting.  North Korea flight-tested more than 20 ballistic missiles, introducing several kinds of new and advanced long-range ballistic missiles. They include two intercontinental ballistic missiles that can reach the US carrying a nuclear payload. They also carried out their sixth and most powerful nuclear test.  The first days of 2018, however, give cautious cause for optimism.  Following North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un's new year offer to South Korea to discuss participation in the upcoming Winter Olympic Games in South Korea, inter-Korean diplomacy is set to resume for the first time since December 2015. Early on Friday morning, North Korea notified South Korea's unification ministry that it would send a representative for bilateral talks at Panmunjom in the heavily guarded demilitarised zone (DMZ), where the armistice ending the Korean War was signed and where most North-South interactions take place.  Pyongyang's acceptance of South Korea's overtures means diplomacy now has more momentum than at any time since since US President Donald Trump took office. Adding to the good vibes, shortly before North Korea's acceptance of talks the US announced that it had agreed to a South Korean request to delay the joint military Key Resolve and Foal Eagle exercises until the conclusion of the Paralympic Games on 18 March.  South Korea asked for the delay amid concerns North Korea would stage some kind of provocation during the Winter Olympics. The North has long said the springtime Foal Eagle exercises - which involve the mass mobilisation of troops and heavy military assets - are a ruse for preventive war. All this suggests a calmer climate on the Korean Peninsula after a tempestuous 2017, but there remains cause for concern. Although delaying military exercises may appear to be a US concession, Pyongyang may demand more. During his new year address, Mr Kim explicitly said that South Korea ""should discontinue all the nuclear war drills they stage with outside forces"". Mr Kim may know this is asking too much, particularly given that his intercontinental ballistic missiles introduce the old Cold War spectre of ""decoupling"", whereby a direct threat to the US could reduce its willingness to commit to defending South Korea.  But the North Korean leader may still not see a delay as sufficient cause for inter-Korean bonhomie. Indeed, if his address suggested anything, it was that he senses he is in a position of strength after an incredibly successful year for his nuclear and ballistic missile programmes. With all that leverage, North Korea may make heavy demands at the negotiating table next week. Second, the focus next Tuesday at Panmunjom will be the participation of two North Korean figure skaters at the Winter Olympics. Concluding an agreement to facilitate their participation would no doubt make for a moment of inter-Korean closeness, but it is unclear where diplomacy might progress from there. Even at this moment of optimism, we must ask if we have already reached the high point for diplomacy on the Korean peninsula in 2018.  Should the Panmunjom talks succeed, we may see a geopolitically uneventful Winter Olympics, but North Korea may return to testing ballistic missiles as early as late March, as the US-South Korea exercises begin. For diplomacy to succeed in 2018, the US and South Korea will have to extend this brief window of opportunity. Unfortunately, Seoul and Washington will remain divided on the correct path ahead.  While South Korean President Moon Jae-in has long been disposed toward engagement with the North, the Trump administration may see no alternative to doubling down on its policy of ""maximum pressure"", refusing to cede an inch. Potentially fatal to a springtime détente would be continued mixed messaging and boorish rhetoric from the US president.  Mr Trump has bragged about the size of his ""nuclear button"" compared with Mr Kim's and also applauded the inter-Korean talks as a positive development. With the Trump administration a year into office and senior Asia roles within the US foreign policy bureaucracy slowly being filled, Washington must be ready to stand alongside Seoul as it approaches North Korea without losing sight of its long-term objective of denuclearising the Korean peninsula.  In 2017, Mr Moon showed remarkable pragmatism in approaching North Korea alongside Washington and now it is time for the US to play a similar role. Should the allies themselves find little common ground, it is more likely than not that this moment of diplomatic optimism on the peninsula will be fleeting.

geopolitical tensions,Stock markets hit by Ukraine invasion fears,2024-09-15,2022-02-14,By Russell Hotten,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60374581,"Europe's stock markets closed sharply lower on Monday, but recouped some losses in afternoon trading on hopes of a deal to resolve Ukraine tensions. The FTSE 100 ended 1.7% down, and the main markets in Paris and Frankfurt 2% lower, with travel stocks hard hit. Reports from Russia that talks with the West over Ukraine should continue helped improve investor sentiment. That limited losses on Wall Street, where at lunchtime in New York the Dow Jones was down 0.5% and Nasdaq up 0.7%. According to reports, Sergei Lavrov has suggested to Russia's President Vladimir Putin that diplomatic efforts should continue because there might be a chance of doing a deal. On the FTSE 100, IAG, the owner of British Airways and Iberia, fell 5.6%. Shares in the major banks closed between 4% and 5% down. The biggest loser was London-listed Russian mining company Evraz, which tumbled 29%. The FTSE 100's fall, the worst session in three weeks, followed a fall in Asian stock markets. ""The fact that the door has not been shut to further talks... is a good thing,"" said Patrick O'Hare, at Briefing.com. ""Hence, the negativity seen earlier has dissipated some, yet there is still a major cloud of uncertainty hanging over the market."" Oil initially rose sharply with Brent crude topping $95 (£70) per barrel, stoking fresh inflationary worries, although the price has eased back slightly.  With oil demand high as global economies emerge from lockdown, there are fears a war or severe sanctions on Russia will cut supplies, sending the price above $100 a barrel, something not seen since 2014. ""Just as the storm of Covid appeared to be receding, the growing expectation of an invasion of Ukraine is the fresh threat now unnerving investors, with confidence plunging in many parts of the world,"" said Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Susannah Streeter.  She added: ""With worries that inflation is already running far too hot, the possibility Russian troops could move across the border has led to another surge in the oil price. Energy markets are clearly on edge and if supplies are threatened there is a risk oil will shoot up even higher."" Analysts at Capital Economics estimate war or sanctions could add to inflation in Europe, forcing central banks to lift interest rates faster and further. ""Over the longer term, whether Russia ends up invading or not, this geopolitical flare-up is likely to speed up the process of Russia's decoupling from the West,"" Capital Economics said in a research note. Moscow has amassed an estimated 100,000 troops along Ukraine's border but denies any intent to invade.  Despite this, more than a dozen countries have urged their citizens to leave Ukraine, with the US saying Moscow could begin an attack ""at any time"". "
geopolitical tensions,India's fabled neutrality under strain over Ukraine,2024-09-15,2022-03-25,By Soutik Biswas,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-60857406,"On Monday, US President Joe Biden told a meeting of business leaders in Washington that among the so-called Quad group of nations, India was being ""somewhat shaky"" in its response to Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine. The US, Japan and Australia - the three other members of this coalition formed to counter China's influence - have been ""extremely strong in terms of dealing with Putin's aggression"", he said. India, however, has doggedly pursued a non-aligned foreign policy since independence, where, according to the first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru, ""we will stay away from the big blocs…to be friendly to all countries…not join any alliance.""  But will the war in Ukraine now put India's fabled neutrality under strain? ""India is feeling the heat, no doubt about it,"" Michael Kugelman, deputy director of the Asia Program at the Wilson Center, a Washington-based think tank, says.  ""Fence-sitting is a bigger diplomatic gamble now than in the past, given that Russia's invasion of Ukraine is one of the worst aggressions in decades and India's relations with the West have never been stronger."" India has abstained from voting in the United Nations - three times in a week - on resolutions condemning Russia. There have been reports of a surge of Indian imports of discounted Russian oil as energy prices spiked in the wake of the war. And it has pointedly stopped short of criticising Russia which it has called a ""longstanding and time-tested friend in the past. The two countries share a decades-old relationship harking back to the Cold War, and Russia is also India's biggest defence supplier.  The US is now trying to persuade India that things have changed. For one, the relationship between the two countries has deepened - bilateral trade between India and the US is $150bn, compared to $8bn between India and Russia.   US Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland visited Delhi this week, and had, in her own words, ""broad and deep conversations"" with Indian Foreign Minister S Jaishankar and senior officials. She acknowledged the historical relationship between India and Russia, but said ""times have changed now"" and there was ""an evolution of thinking in India"". Ms Nuland told journalists that the US and Europe were willing to be strong ""defence and security partners"" of India. She said US could help wean India off its dependence on Russian defence supplies. The war was a ""major inflection point in the ""autocratic-democratic struggle"" in which India's support was needed, she noted.   Such an explicit message from the US, Mr Kugelman says, ""may well be uncharted territory"".   But Indian experts are loathe to believe that the country is under diplomatic pressure. They point to the fact that other Quad members have been sympathetic to India and that the US itself had acknowledged India's humanitarian assistance to Ukraine. ""If there's one country which is isolated in the Quad, it's not India, it's the US,"" says former Indian diplomat Jitendra Nath Misra.  And weakening a strategic partner through sanctions - for buying Russian arms or oil - doesn't benefit the US, which wants India to play counterweight to China in the Indo-Pacific.  At the same time, India's close ties with Russia do not mean that it has been aloof to the crisis in Ukraine, experts say.  They point to the joint statement issued last week by Mr Modi and his Japanese counterpart Fumio Kishida during the latter's visit to Delhi: the two leaders expressed their ""serious concern about the ongoing conflict and humanitarian crisis in Ukraine"". They also ""emphasised that the contemporary global order has been built on the UN Charter, international law and respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity of states"".  Mr Modi has spoken to both President Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky urging them to end the violence. His government managed to get more than 22,000 Indians out of Ukraine in 90 evacuation flights. Former diplomat Anil Triguniyat, who served in Moscow, says President Biden's remark that India's response was ""shaky"" was ""possibly a joke of some kind"". ""India's position has been consistent and principled all through. India has stood for diplomacy, dialogue, respecting territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine,"" he says. ""We have to be strategically neutral. There's no other way.""  Happymon Jacob, a professor of foreign policy at Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University, believes that the ""heat hasn't really increased on India and it is managing the contradictions quite well"".  ""The question is whether India could have done more,"" he says. The jury is out on this.  Although India had managed the crisis admirably, it should have called a ""spade a spade… It is an invasion, it is a war,"" India's former foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon told The Wire. It ""affects your credibility if you don't"", he added. But Delhi's special relationship with Moscow - ""fraught with nostalgia and deep trust"", as Mr Kugelman describes it - means that it won't easily turn against its ally.  ""These sentiments die hard, even after Russia has launched a massive, cold-blooded invasion. But at the same time India doesn't want to alienate its ties with the West"".  One way to avoid alienation, say experts, is for India to offer itself as a third-party mediator - something which Ukraine's Ambassador to India, Igor Polikha, had urged at the beginning of the war.  ""India can leverage its deep ties to Moscow and cordial relations with Kyiv and try to push both sides to de-escalate,"" Mr Kugelman says. ""To be sure, Putin might be undeterrable. But if Delhi is at least making an effort to bring about de-escalation, that should pre-empt potential tensions with the West over India's refusal to take the West's side."" Mr Jacob echoes the sentiment, saying when Ukrainians asked for mediation, India could have taken up the offer. ""India still has the opportunity. It should still go ahead and offer itself as a neutral mediator."" After all, India needs both US and Russia on its side to help manage its fraught relationship with China. Last year, the two neighbours faced off against each other along their disputed border in the Himalayan region.  In the long term, Mr Triguniyat says, India should pursue a policy of strategic autonomy - not far removed from non-alignment -and initiate a grouping of ""nations for strategic unity"" to serve their development interests in a ""much more severe Cold War 2.0"" that is likely to emerge after the war in Ukraine. Former Indian foreign secretary Shyam Saran has said the ""nightmare scenario"" for India would be if ""the US comes to the conclusion that it confronts a greater threat from Russia and that this justifies a strategic accommodation with China"". Bluntly this means, ""concede Chinese dominance in Asia, while safeguarding its European flank.""  That's a ""nightmare"" India will never get used to. "

geopolitical tensions,Ukrainians train for war as invasion fears grow,2024-09-15,2022-02-01,By Sarah Rainsford,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-60220422,"Dmytro Dubas thought his war was over. Now the US is warning of an all-out Russian invasion of Ukraine and the veteran volunteer fighter can't ignore it.  ""Last week I was pretty disturbed; I even went to my psychologist for help,"" he admits. For months, Ukraine's Western allies have been pointing to Russian troops massing on the border. That's prompted military analysts abroad to produce endless maps covered in arrows that confidently predict how Vladimir Putin's troops will advance on Kyiv.  Ukrainians who'd be in the direct line of any such incursion are far less convinced it will happen.  But all the war talk is unsettling. ""Russia can always transfer troops to the border in a matter of days and then invade, so this build-up is nothing different,"" Dmytro argues, in his Kyiv flat.                                             In 2014, then working in sales, he joined the flood of volunteer soldiers pouring east when heavy fighting against Russian-backed forces erupted. There's been a formal ceasefire in place since 2015 but it breaks down regularly and the threat of a sudden escalation in the violence is ever present.  But Dmytro had returned to civilian life, storing the reminders of his time in the trenches in an old ammunition box painted and re-fashioned as a coffee table in his living room. Now he's calmed his nerves by preparing for the worst possible scenario: filling his car with fuel, buying emergency food supplies and signing-up with the territorial defence force to brush-up his skills. Western intelligence agencies have ascribed all sorts of plans to Vladimir Putin, including besieging Kyiv. Ukrainian officials from President Volodymyr Zelensky down have batted-back that idea, wary of spreading panic.  At the same time, city schools are practising bomb scare or air raid drills, social media is full of official guides to preparing an emergency ""grab bag"" for evacuation and people have begun plotting their escape route which mostly involves driving west as fast as they can. Even pensioners have been joining weekend drills in woodland outside Kyiv where concrete factory ruins covered in graffiti stand-in for a battlefield. The men are too old to sign formal contracts, but military trainers don't turn them away. ""I don't think the Russians will invade now thanks to our Western allies giving us weapons,"" 61-year-old Vasyl Nazarov says during a break from crouching on the ice and swivelling back and forth to train his weapon on an imaginary enemy. It's his first session so his ""gun"" is a wooden cut-out for now. ""I don't believe they'll reach Kyiv but we have to be ready for that,"" Vasyl adds.  ""I think the West's threat of terrible sanctions will stop Putin,"" Serhiy Kalinin agrees, flicking a cigarette butt into a snowdrift. It's a few decades since the 64-year-old finished his mandatory military service so he wanted a refresher course. ""The enemy is at our border,"" he says. ""So everyone should be prepared."" At the privately-owned Priamyi TV channel, Russia's deployment of some 100,000 troops to its border with Ukraine has now become ""topic number one"". Presenter Taras Berezovets describes Russia's president as ""unpredictable"" and worries about Mr Putin's ""idée fixe"" that Ukraine has never been a sovereign nation.  ""Putin wants to stop a nation making its own choice, like Soviet leaders did in Eastern Europe for decades,"" the journalist says. His own biography captures some of the complexity of this conflict: his first language is Russian as he's originally from Crimea which Russia annexed illegally from Ukraine in the wake of mass protests in 2014 demanding closer ties with Europe. But Mr Berezovets says his roots don't make him pro-Moscow, or part of any supposed ""Russian world"". ""We made our choice in 2014 and it's clear: we don't want to be part of the Russian 'empire',"" he says firmly. ""Even if there's no chance of joining the EU or Nato, our target is to be part of Western civilisation which means the rule of law, freedom of speech. These are things Ukrainians are ready to fight for."" Despite the Western intelligence reports, Dmytro Dubas and his friends don't sense that an all-out fight over Ukraine's future is just around the corner. The veterans have made plans to send their families to safety, just in case, and agreed where the fighters will meet up and how they'll arm themselves.  But that done, they're focussed on business as usual not an external threat they have to live with long-term and geopolitical forces they can't control. ""It's a famous meme that the biggest headache for Ukraine is being next door to Russia,"" Dmytro shrugs, at a gathering of close friends and colleagues in his kitchen. A fellow veteran volunteer rattles off a whole lot of crises his country has already seen and survived: from the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster to two revolutions then war in the east. ""It's normal in Ukraine for everything around to be in flames,"" Artem smiles.  ""If you think of war every hour of every day you just go crazy,"" another friend, Yuliia, agrees.  ""After all, we can't just pick up Russia and move it, however much we might like to. It's our neighbour and we have to live with that."""
geopolitical tensions,Sunak to meet Chinese President Xi at G20 summit,2024-09-15,2022-11-15,By Becky Morton,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-63641694,"Rishi Sunak will call for a ""frank and constructive relationship"" with China during a meeting with the country's President Xi Jinping at the G20 summit. It is the first time a UK prime minister has met the Chinese president in person since 2018. No 10 said China had ""fundamentally different values to ours"".  But it said issues like the Ukraine war could not be addressed without ""co-ordinated action by the world's major economies"", including China. Leaders of the world's biggest economies are meeting in Bali, Indonesia, to discuss global challenges including the economic recovery from the Covid pandemic and the impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.  On Monday, US President Joe Biden also met President Xi and promised there would be no ""new Cold War"" with China.  The prime minister's official spokesman said the UK government was ""clear-eyed"" in how it approached its relationship with China.  ""The challenges posed by China are systemic, they're long term, and it's a country... with fundamentally different values to ours,"" he said. ""But equally, none of the issues that we are discussing at the G20 - be it the global economy, Ukraine, climate change, global health - none of them can be addressed without co-ordinated action by the world's major economies and of course that includes China."" Downing Street said the prime minister would ""encourage China to use its place on the global stage responsibly to resolve geopolitical tensions, ensure regional stability and play its part in tackling the devastating global impact of the war in Ukraine"". It added that Mr Sunak would stress the UK's national and economic security was a ""pre-condition for any UK-China engagement"".  ""And he will underline the importance the UK places on defending human rights and of speaking out and taking action where we have concerns - as we have done over Hong Kong and Xinjiang,"" No 10 said.  Some Conservative MPs have called on the government to take a tougher stance on China. Last year five MPs and two peers were sanctioned by China after raising concerns about human rights abuses against the Uyghur Muslim minority group in Xinjiang.  Mr Sunak's predecessor Liz Truss was reportedly planning to re-categorise China as a ""threat"" to the UK as part of a foreign policy review.  On Tuesday, asked whether he would do the same, Mr Sunak told reporters: ""I think that China unequivocally poses a systemic threat - well, a systemic challenge - to our values and our interests and is undoubtedly the biggest state-based threat to our economic security."" But he added that it would not be possible to resolve global challenges like climate change or the war in Ukraine ""without having a dialogue with them"".  In response, former Conservative leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith, one of those sanctioned by China, suggested Mr Sunak was softening on his previous position. He told Talk TV: ""It's time to call [China] out as what they are, a threat, but I hope [the prime minister's] not about to do a U-turn, it would be completely wrong."" On Tuesday, Mr Sunak will also meet the leaders of India, Australia and Indonesia, as well as President Biden.  In a meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he will confirm a new partnership with India, opening in early 2023, to give young professionals the chance to work in the other country.  Under the new scheme, the UK will offer 3,000 places annually to degree-educated Indian nationals aged 18-30 to live and work in the UK for up to two years.  The scheme would be reciprocal, with the opportunity for British nationals to also work in India.  Mr Sunak said the Indo-Pacific region was ""increasingly crucial for our security and our prosperity"".  The prime minister, whose parents are of Indian origin and whose wife was born in the country, said: ""I know first-hand the incredible value of the deep cultural and historic ties we have with India."" The UK is currently negotiating a trade deal with India.  Earlier this month, International Trade Secretary Kemi Badenoch denied talks had stalled after Home Secretary Suella Braverman's made comments about Indian migrants in the UK overstaying visas. A deal had been expected to be completed by the end of October to coincide with Diwali. "
geopolitical tensions,Brics ministers call for rebalancing of global order,2024-09-15,2023-06-02,By Oliver Slow,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-65784030,"A meeting of foreign ministers of the Brics group of nations in South Africa has called for a rebalancing of the global order away from Western nations.  South African Foreign Minister Naledi Pandor said the group's vision was to provide global leadership in a world fractured by geopolitical tension, inequality and global insecurity. Brics is an acronym for Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. Allegations of Russian war crimes in Ukraine have clouded the talks.  The International Criminal Court (ICC) has issued an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin over the allegations and, as a member of the court, South Africa would be obliged to arrest him if he attends a Brics summit scheduled for Johannesburg in August. The Brics is seen by some as an alternative to the G7 group of developed nations, which held its annual summit in the Japanese city of Hiroshima last month, and was also attended by the leaders of Brazil and India. G7 members have been highly critical of Russia and China.  Brics countries have a combined population of more than 3.2 billion people, making up about 40% of the world's roughly 8 billion people.  On the first of two days of talks in Cape Town, Indian Minister of External Affairs Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said the gathering must ""send out a strong message that the world is multipolar, that it is rebalancing and that old ways cannot address new situations"".  ""At the heart of the problems we face is economic concentration that leaves too many nations at the mercy of too few,"" he said. Brazilian Foreign Minister Mauro Vieira described the Brics as an ""indispensable mechanism for building a multipolar world order that reflects the devices and needs of developing countries"". Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Ma Zhaoxu said the Brics group could be expanded to provide assistance to developing countries and emerging market economies. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said ""more than a dozen"" countries including Saudi Arabia had expressed interest in joining the group. His presence at the event was met with protests, with demonstrators holding a picture of Mr Lavrov with the words ""child murderer"".  One protester told AFP news agency it was difficult to see South African officials ""shaking the hand of a person who is part of these systemic war crimes against Ukrainian children"", a reference to the ICC case against Mr Putin.  South Africa's governing African National Congress (ANC) has long-standing ties with Russia that go back to the years of white-minority rule before 1994, and the country has refused to criticise Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.  Earlier this week, a deputy minister told the BBC the country planned to change its laws so that it had the power to decide whether or not to arrest a leader wanted by the ICC.  At a news conference, Dr Pandor was asked by BBC correspondent Andrew Harding whether Mr Putin would be arrested if he came to the summit in August.  ""The president [Cyril Ramaphosa] will indicate what the final position in South Africa is,"" she replied. A senior official privately described the situation as a diplomatic nightmare from which the South African government was desperate to escape, and one option said to be under consideration is moving the summit to another country.

geopolitical tensions,"Bitcoin tops £5,000 in value",2024-09-15,2017-11-01,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-41836553,"The price of Bitcoin has surpassed £5,000 per coin - a new record. While it is a historic moment of sorts, Bitcoin is usually compared to the dollar. The virtual currency peaked at $6,649.33 (£5,015) at about 16:34 GMT on Wednesday, according to Bloomberg. The total value of Bitcoin in circulation is currently $110bn (£83bn) and the cryptocurrency has risen more than seven-fold against the dollar over the past year. The reason for the latest jump in value was in part driven by an announcement by US-based derivatives marketplace operator CME Group about a plan to launch a Bitcoin futures product before the end of the year. Bitcoin was launched in January 2009. Its value was lower than $100 in June 2013, and below $1,000 as recently as January. But in August, the virtual currency soared to $3,451 after a spin-off - Bitcoin Cash - failed to prove as disruptive as had been feared. And in September, Bitcoin crossed the $5,000 threshold for the first time. ""It's been a very innovative year - there have been a lot of new technology platforms for cryptocurrencies, which have lifted Bitcoin,"" Garrick Hileman a research fellow at University of Cambridge told the BBC. ""It wouldn't surprise me if the price were to go even higher."" Coinbase - a business that lets the public trade and store digital currencies - reports that it is now signing up between 35,000 to 50,000 new users per day. Mr Hileman said that many people had recently been attracted to invest in Bitcoin because when a ""fork"" happened in August, investors received an equivalent amount of new Bitcoin Cash coins for free. Another ""fork"", SegWit2x, is due to happen on 18 November. ""Rising geopolitical tensions on the Korean Peninsula are also driving interest in Bitcoin in the surrounding countries, because people are wary of investing in the yen or the dollar,"" Mr Hileman added. However, he continued, government regulators may crack down on cryptocurrencies, which could drive prices back down."
geopolitical tensions,Consumers urged to cut energy use this winter,2024-09-15,2022-10-13,By Simon Read,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63242050,"The UK's energy watchdog will call on the public to cut how much gas and electricity they use this winter to guard against the risk of shortages.  Ofgem is set to launch a campaign to show people how to reduce energy use. Ofgem boss Jonathan Brearley is expected to say that a supply emergency is unlikely. But he will also warn the coming months could be ""difficult"" and ""we cannot at any time, particularly this winter, eliminate all risk"". The initiative, set to be launched in a speech later on Thursday, comes as the government appeared to change direction on its own public information campaign to cut energy bills. Last week, cabinet minister Nadhim Zahawi said a planned £15m government drive to encourage household energy-saving had been dropped because the National Grid and Ofgem were running similar campaigns. But the BBC also reported that the campaign had been shelved after opposition by Prime Minister Liz Truss.  At Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, however, Pensions Minister Guy Opperman asked Ms Truss about having a nationwide mailout campaign on cutting energy usage. She said that the Business and Energy Secretary, Jacob Rees-Mogg, ""is working on a plan to help companies and individuals use energy more efficiently"", adding: ""I hope we'll be able to start this going in Number 10 straight away."" In a speech due to be made at industry body Energy UK, Mr Brearley will say that ""all of us should be thinking about how to reduce our energy use where possible"". He will add that cutting consumption ""is not only the most direct way of reducing our bills. It directly helps with security of supply, contributes to decarbonisation, and saves money for the public finances"". National Grid recently warned that British households could lose power for up to three hours at a time this winter if gas supplies run extremely low. It said it was an ""unlikely"" scenario, but added that supply interruptions were a possibility if the energy crisis escalated. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has created ""unprecedented turmoil and volatility"" in the energy markets, according to National Grid.  Gas flows from Russia to Europe have been all but cut off, leaving countries scrambling for alternative supplies.  Mr Brearley will say: ""Russia is using energy as a geopolitical weapon.""  He is expected to tell the audience at Energy UK: ""The overall picture for Britain remains favourable. We are in a stronger position than many European countries. ""However, we should be under no illusion that this winter is likely to be a difficult environment - and we cannot at any time, particularly this winter, eliminate all risk. Mr Brearley is also expected to say the government's Energy Price Guarantee and Energy Bills Support Scheme will provide ""much needed relief"" to millions of consumers and businesses. But the Energy Price Guarantee still means that a typical household will be paying around double what they were a year ago, with the typical bill around £2,500 rather than £1,277 last October.

geopolitical tensions,The election with India and China on the ballot,2024-09-15,2023-09-26,By Anbarasan Ethirajan,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-66909240,"The Maldives, best known for its pristine beaches, coral reefs and diverse marine life, is the last place you would expect a geopolitical rivalry to play out.  The island nation which consists of about 1,200 coral islands and atolls in the middle of the Indian Ocean will see a run-off poll between President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih and opposition candidate Mohamed Muizzu on 30 September.  But also on the ballot are India and China.  Both countries are trying to strengthen their presence in the strategically located islands which straddle busy east-west shipping lanes.  Maldives' two presidential contenders, who have been crisscrossing the islands by airplanes and boats to canvass voters, each represent a different Asian power.  Following his surprise win in 2018, Mr Solih from the Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) strengthened relations with India with which Malé has strong cultural and financial ties. Mr Muizzu from the Progressive Alliance coalition favours better relations with China. The Maldives has long been under India's sphere of influence. Maintaining its presence there gives Delhi the ability to monitor a key part of the Indian Ocean.  China, with its rapidly expanding naval forces, would want access to such a strategically important location - something India wants to prevent. Beijing is also keen to protect its energy supplies from the Gulf which pass through that route. Both Delhi and Beijing have given the Maldives hundreds of millions of dollars in the form of loans and grants for infrastructure and development projects. But this election, it seems that China has the edge. Mr Solih has received just 39% of the votes polled in the first round of elections which were held earlier this month.  One issue that may have hurt the current president's performance is criticism that his administration has forged close ties with Delhi - called the ""India-first"" policy - at the expense of China. But Mr Solih dismisses this argument.  ""We do not view it as a zero-sum game where good relations with one country are at the cost of relations with the other,"" he told the BBC in an email interview. One of the reasons the ""India-first"" policy has become unpopular is because of the furore over ""gifts"" Delhi gave the Maldives - two helicopters received in 2010 and 2013 and a small aircraft in 2020. Delhi said the craft were to be used for search and rescue missions and medical evacuations. But in 2021, the Maldivian defence force said about 75 Indian military personnel were based in the country to operate and maintain the Indian aircraft. Soon after, the opposition began an ""India out"" campaign which demanded Indian security personnel leave the Maldives. The opposition argued the presence of these military personnel endangered its national security. It has now become a key election issue but Mr Solih says these fears are exaggerated. ""There are no militarily active overseas personnel stationed in the Maldives. Indian personnel currently present in the country are under the operational command of the Maldives National Defence Force,"" he told the BBC. Under Abdulla Yameen, who was president from 2013 to 2018, the Maldives moved closer to China and joined President Xi Jinping's grand Belt and Road Initiative - to build road, rail and sea links between China and the rest of the world.  When India and Western lenders were not willing to offer loans to Yameen's administration due to allegations of human rights violations, he turned to Beijing which offered the money without any conditions. He is currently serving a 11-year prison term for corruption, barring him from contesting this year's vote. Mr Miuzzu is widely regarded as a proxy for Yameen.  Given Yameen's tense relationship with Delhi, China is an obvious choice for the opposition to seek support. One of the biggest and most visible Chinese funded projects is a 2.1km (1.3 mile) four-lane bridge that connects the capital Malé with the international airport that is situated on a different island. The $200 million (£164m) bridge was inaugurated in 2018 while Yameen was still president.  Though India has also tried to match Chinese investments by offering loans and grants of more than $2bn over the past few years, Delhi's motives are viewed with suspicion by many in the Maldives. Critics say India indirectly has boots on the ground there.  Another concern is that the Maldives might be affected as tensions between India and China escalate along their Himalayan border, ""There is a much larger sentiment in the Maldives that we should not have any substantive strategic relationship with any country, including India,"" says Azim Zahir, a Maldives analyst and a lecturer at the University of Western Australia. With the run-off due in a few days, Mr Solih is facing a tough battle as he has not managed to rope in key smaller parties to narrow the gap with his rival. Sensing that the governing MDP has been struggling to counter the ""India out"" narrative, the opposition alliance has stepped up its offensive. ""We are concerned about the erosion of sovereignty as a result of the current government's over-dependence on India,"" argues Mohamed Hussain Shareef, vice president of the opposition alliance. He argues that every single project in the country is being carried out through Indian financing and implemented by Indian companies. But while the ""India out"" campaign is dominating the campaign, many young Maldivians are worried about rising cost of living, unemployment and climate change.  ""We are very concerned about employment opportunities for the youth. Many young people want to migrate even though they are keen to stay back and serve the country,"" Ms Fathimath Raaia Shareef, a student at the Maldives National University, told the BBC.  But these domestic issues are likely to take a back seat, as the winner of the election could determine which Asian power wins a vital foothold in the battle for dominance in the region. "
geopolitical tensions,China exports see biggest drop for three years,2024-09-15,2023-08-08,By Faarea Masud & Natalie Sherman,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-66436582,"China's imports and exports fell more sharply than expected last month as weaker global demand threatened the recovery prospects of the world's second-largest economy. Official figures show that exports fell by 14.5% in July compared with a year earlier, while imports dropped 12.4%. The grim trade figures reinforce concerns that the country's economic growth could slow further this year. It will increase pressure on Beijing to help boost the post-pandemic recovery. China's economy grew just 3% last year - apart from the slowdown when Covid struck, the weakest rate since 1976 - reflecting the toll from coronavirus restrictions that remained some of the most stringent in the world, long after many other countries had resumed more normal patterns.  A full lockdown was imposed for two full months from March 2022 in the financial hub of Shanghai, home to around 25 million people, with the government delivering food packages to residents confined in their home.  Though officials loosened restrictions in November, recovery has remained lacklustre.  The unemployment rate among China's youth exceeded 20% in May and a crisis in the housing sector has damaged confidence.  Weaker economic growth overseas has also reduced foreign demand for Chinese goods, while geopolitical tensions between China and the US and others have taken a further toll on trade, encouraging international firms to shift investments out of the country.  July was the third month in a row that China's shipments overseas have declined, marking the sharpest fall since February 2020 at the height of the pandemic.  Exports to the US, one of China's biggest buyers, fell 23.1% year-on-year. The European Union also bought 20.6% less from China.  Louise Loo from Oxford Economics warned that the pressures on foreign trade will linger, as higher borrowing costs and rising living costs weigh on economic activity in other parts of the world, eroding demand for goods.  ""The backdrop for China's external demand could become considerably more challenging in the coming quarters,"" she said.  China's position as a major importer also means its sluggish trade performance is likely to have a knock-on effect on the global economy, said Steve Clayton, head of equity funds for investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown. Prices for commodities from oil to copper slipped in response to the news, while shares in luxury goods producers such as LVMH - which have long looked to China for growth - also dropped. ""A weaker China means lower demand in the wider global economy too,"" Mr Clayton said. ""China's woes may well be felt beyond its own shores, underlining the interlinkage of the world's leading economies."" China's central bank has cut interest rates in recent months in a bid to boost the economy and regulators have also relaxed their scrutiny of key sectors such as the tech industry. But officials have so far resisted major measures to stimulate the economy.  Weak growth means China is not facing the rising prices that have rattled many other countries and prompted central bankers elsewhere to sharply increase borrowing costs."
geopolitical tensions,US bars tech firms from building China factories,2024-09-15,2022-09-07,By Monica Miller,https://www.bbc.com/news/62803224,"US tech companies that receive federal funding will be barred from building ""advanced technology"" facilities in China for 10 years, the Biden administration has said.  The guidelines were unveiled as part of a $50bn (£43bn) plan aimed at building up the local semiconductor industry.  It comes as business groups have pushed for more government support in an effort to reduce reliance on China. They are faced with a global microchip shortage which has slowed production. ""We're going to be implementing the guardrails to ensure those who receive CHIPS funds cannot compromise national security... they're not allowed to use this money to invest in China, they can't develop leading-edge technologies in China.... for a period of ten years,"" according to US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo., explaining the US Chips and Science Act.  ""Companies who receive the money can only expand their mature node factories in China to serve the Chinese market."" The US and China are locked in a long-running dispute over trade and technology. In August, US President Joe Biden had signed a law committing $280bn (£232bn) to high tech manufacturing and scientific research, amid fears that the US is losing its technological edge to China.  The investments include tax breaks for companies that build computer chip manufacturing plants in the US. The US currently produces roughly 10% of the global supply of semiconductors, which are key to everything from cars to mobile phones, down from nearly 40% in 1990. The Chinese Embassy in Washington had opposed the semiconductor bill, calling it reminiscent of a ""Cold War mentality."" Some US chipmakers are already experiencing the impact of Washington's crackdown on selling US technology to China. Earlier this month, Nvidia and AMD were told by US officials to stop the sale of artificial intelligence chips to China.   Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities called the restrictions a ""gut punch"" for Nvidia.  ""This is really a shot across the bow at China and it's really going to fan those flames in terms of geopolitical (tensions),"" Mr Ives had told teh BBC. "
geopolitical tensions,Fuel hikes threaten consumer spending,2024-09-15,2018-05-21,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44195218,"The price of fuel has hit a three-and-a-half-year high as the price of oil continues to climb, putting more pressure on consumers. The average price of petrol has risen to 127.22p a litre and diesel to 129.96p a litre, following a rapid rise in the oil price. Recent figures suggest a squeeze on incomes has begun to ease, with wages growing faster than prices.  However, rising fuel prices threaten to prevent inflation slowing. ""Things have started to look better for the UK consumer recently, with inflationary pressures easing and real wage growth finally started picking up,"" said George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.  However, he said, that drivers had noticed the impact of higher fuel prices at the pumps. ""Filling up the tank is a pretty essential expense for most of us, so the average consumer could find there's a few pounds less in the jar at the end of each month.""   Earlier this month, government figures indicated wages grew at an annual rate of 2.9% in the three months to March, whereas over the same period the inflation rate was 2.7%.  As a result, for the first time in a year, real incomes grew, although they remain lower than they were before the financial crisis. ""Official figures show that transport is routinely the single biggest area of household expenditure bar none and in most cases transport equals the car,"" said Philip Gomm of the RAC Foundation.  He said the poorest households tended to be hit hardest because they drive the oldest, least fuel-efficient vehicles. In early 2016, fuel prices dipped almost to the £1 a litre mark as oil went below $30 a barrel. Since then both have risen fairly steadily. This month the price of crude oil briefly reached $80 a barrel and is still at levels not seen since 2014. Last week, the chief executive of French oil company Total, Patrick Pouyanne, said he believed oil could reach $100 ""in the coming months"". ""If the boss of one of the world's largest oil companies is talking about $100 a barrel or more, then you have to think things are going to get worse before they get better,"" said Mr Gomm, pointing out that prices at the pumps lag behind prices in the wholesale market.  However, Ruth Gregory, chief UK economist at Capital Economics said she expected the impact of higher fuel prices on the UK consumer to remain limited. ""We're expecting the oil price to drift lower by the end of next year. The recent rise mostly reflects geopolitical tension and the potential risk of supply disruption, factors we think should prove temporary."" In the meantime, the overall trend for rising wages would continue she said. ""We've seen clear signs of a revival of pay growth in recent figures and we are expecting a further tick up to around 3% towards the end of this year."" Alan Clarke, UK economist at Scotiabank, said while filling the tank represents only around 3% of household expenditure on average, fuel price rises could still dent consumer confidence.  ""The sentiment is important,"" he said. ""You really notice [price rises] for things you buy frequently like petrol and food."" He said by July, petrol and diesel prices were likely to be 14-15% higher than a year earlier.  When prices rise for non-discretionary things such as fuel, there is less left for ""fun"" items such as holidays and eating out, Mr Clarke said. The higher fuel price comes in the wake of higher crude oil prices. The rise has been driven in part by President Trump's announcement that the US would re-impose sanctions on Iran, overturning the deal to curb Iran's nuclear ambitions and raising fears that Iran's energy exports would be affected. Fresh US sanctions against Venezuela after the re-election of socialist leader, Nicolas Maduro, have also pushed the price of oil higher. Despite this, BP chief executive Bob Dudley has said he expects US shale and increased supply from members of oil producers group Opec to make up for lost production elsewhere.  He predicted the oil price would return to between $50 and $65 a barrel in the near future."
geopolitical tensions,Stock markets hit by Ukraine invasion fears,2024-09-15,2022-02-14,By Russell Hotten,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60374581,"Europe's stock markets closed sharply lower on Monday, but recouped some losses in afternoon trading on hopes of a deal to resolve Ukraine tensions. The FTSE 100 ended 1.7% down, and the main markets in Paris and Frankfurt 2% lower, with travel stocks hard hit. Reports from Russia that talks with the West over Ukraine should continue helped improve investor sentiment. That limited losses on Wall Street, where at lunchtime in New York the Dow Jones was down 0.5% and Nasdaq up 0.7%. According to reports, Sergei Lavrov has suggested to Russia's President Vladimir Putin that diplomatic efforts should continue because there might be a chance of doing a deal. On the FTSE 100, IAG, the owner of British Airways and Iberia, fell 5.6%. Shares in the major banks closed between 4% and 5% down. The biggest loser was London-listed Russian mining company Evraz, which tumbled 29%. The FTSE 100's fall, the worst session in three weeks, followed a fall in Asian stock markets. ""The fact that the door has not been shut to further talks... is a good thing,"" said Patrick O'Hare, at Briefing.com. ""Hence, the negativity seen earlier has dissipated some, yet there is still a major cloud of uncertainty hanging over the market."" Oil initially rose sharply with Brent crude topping $95 (£70) per barrel, stoking fresh inflationary worries, although the price has eased back slightly.  With oil demand high as global economies emerge from lockdown, there are fears a war or severe sanctions on Russia will cut supplies, sending the price above $100 a barrel, something not seen since 2014. ""Just as the storm of Covid appeared to be receding, the growing expectation of an invasion of Ukraine is the fresh threat now unnerving investors, with confidence plunging in many parts of the world,"" said Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Susannah Streeter.  She added: ""With worries that inflation is already running far too hot, the possibility Russian troops could move across the border has led to another surge in the oil price. Energy markets are clearly on edge and if supplies are threatened there is a risk oil will shoot up even higher."" Analysts at Capital Economics estimate war or sanctions could add to inflation in Europe, forcing central banks to lift interest rates faster and further. ""Over the longer term, whether Russia ends up invading or not, this geopolitical flare-up is likely to speed up the process of Russia's decoupling from the West,"" Capital Economics said in a research note. Moscow has amassed an estimated 100,000 troops along Ukraine's border but denies any intent to invade.  Despite this, more than a dozen countries have urged their citizens to leave Ukraine, with the US saying Moscow could begin an attack ""at any time"". "
geopolitical tensions,Ukraine crisis: Putin's geopolitical jigsaw,2024-09-15,2022-01-28,By Steve Rosenberg,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-60152007,"Ever tried doing a jigsaw which has half the pieces missing? It's frustrating. It's confusing. You never see the full picture.  Welcome to the world of Kremlin politics.  Puzzling out what Vladimir Putin is thinking and planning is challenging, to say the least. That's how the Kremlin likes it: keeping everyone guessing.  What is President Putin's plan for Ukraine? Is Moscow preparing a full-scale invasion? A more limited operation? Or is the sabre-rattling simply brinkmanship, coercive diplomacy (at its most coercive)?  The geopolitical jigsaw is incomplete.  The pieces of the puzzle we do have are causing concern in the West:  Washington has now replied in writing to Moscow's security demands. The Kremlin says it will analyse America's response. In the meantime, the tough talking continues. ""Do not put Nato infrastructure on Ukrainian territory. We ask our 'partners' in Nato countries to get out. Get out from our borders. Get out from post-Soviet countries, because it's threatening to Russian people,"" says Yevgeny Popov. Mr Popov, who hosts a talk show on state TV, is also an MP from the party of power, United Russia. ""Time is running out,"" Mr Popov warns me. ""You have to make a decision. Fast."" ""Otherwise what?"" I ask. ""Otherwise it will be a tremendously dangerous reaction for the whole world. Some Western officials said that Russia has no balls. Guys, do you really want to see it?"" In public, Russian officials insist that Nato is a danger to Russia's national security.  I'm sceptical. I find it hard to believe that Moscow truly sees the alliance is a threat.  Only 6% of Russia's borders touch Nato countries; the Kremlin has good relations with some Nato members, like Italy and Hungary; it's even sold weapons systems to Nato member Turkey.  And keep in mind that Nato (in the shape of Norway) has been on Russia's border for more than 70 years.  Plus, there is no sign whatsoever of Ukraine, Georgia or other former Soviet states being accepted into Nato in the near future. So why is the Kremlin fixating on the Nato alliance?  Partly for domestic reasons: to get the Russian people to unite against an alleged external enemy.  But also, perhaps, as an excuse to use this moment to reshape the European security order to Moscow's benefit; to re-establish Russia's sphere of influence and try to rewrite the results of the Cold War. ""Putin believes the West exploited Russian weakness in the 1990s, that Russia wasn't treated fairly and didn't get what it deserved. He wants to change that,"" believes Andrei Kortunov, director general of the Russian International Affairs Council, a think-tank linked to the authorities.  ""His argument is very simple. Now the balance of powers has shifted, it's no longer the West-centred unipolar world. You should listen to us and take our concerns seriously.""  So what will Moscow's next step be?  Without all the pieces of the jigsaw, we can only guess. It may depend on whether America's offer to negotiate with Russia on some aspects of European security will be enough to satisfy Vladimir Putin.  If it's not, if the Kremlin leader is determined to dismantle the current European security architecture, military confrontation is possible and long-term friction between East and West. ""I hope Putin will be satisfied with what he got so far,"" Mr Kortunov tells me. ""I think to some extent he was successful. He enforced a dialogue on the West. So, he could argue his mission was accomplished; that keeping tensions on the Ukrainian border helped him incentivise the West to consider Russian proposals.  ""But he may have a different interpretation. He may say the West is trying to engage Russia in endless and pointless negotiations and that Western penetration into Ukraine will continue.  ""Domestically, though, Russian society is not eager for a big war on its doorstep. Russians are not eager to participate in a major military operation in Ukraine,"" Mr Kortunov adds."
geopolitical tensions,How the end of oil could destabilise geopolitics,2024-09-15,2020-01-03,By James Landale,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-50974609,"If you want to understand the revolution taking place in renewable energy, come to a power station called Gemasolar in southern Spain. Here, in the dusty plains of Andalusia, they have worked out how to generate solar power 24 hours a day.  Yes, you can read that sentence again. At Gemasolar they create electricity even when the Sun is not shining. They have rigged up more than 2,500 huge mirrors on hydraulic mounts that follow the Sun's passage through the sky. The mirrors - each about the size of half a tennis court - reflect the Sun's rays to one central point, the top of a 140m (459ft) tower, where molten salt is heated to almost 600C. This liquid salt is carried down the tower to where it heats the steam that powers a turbine. And here's the trick: not all the salt is used at that point. Some is stored in huge tanks and used later when the Sun has gone down. So long as the Sun shines every day, the plant can generate power 24/7. I tell you this not just as an illustration of how fast renewable technology is changing - this particular innovation is not that new - but also as an example of how electrified our energy is set to become.  The expansion of electric vehicles is predicted to accelerate significantly, to a point when it will become the norm rather than the exception. Battery technology still has far to go but many scientists and businesses are competing to find ways of storing electrical power that is lighter and longer-lasting. Already some electrically powered passenger aircraft are in production. How long before ships can be powered by batteries rather than fuel oil? The obvious and much-contested question is when this renewable revolution will reach its peak and whether it will come in time to protect the planet from global warming. That is not something I am qualified to answer. What interests me is a separate question: what impact might this new technology have, not on the world's climate, but its politics? What happens to the global balance of political power when so many countries no longer need to buy so much oil and gas? This is a question that Adam Bowen and I have sought to answer in a documentary for the BBC World Service and Radio Four. For more than a century, nations that had oil and gas had power, literally and politically. Wars were fought over the stuff. It all began before the World War One when Winston Churchill - as First Lord of the Admiralty - converted the British navy from Welsh coal to imported oil.  To secure British access to that oil, the future British prime minister bought a controlling stake in the Anglo Persian oil company, the forerunner of BP, in what is now Iran.  From that moment, much of the history of the 20th Century can be seen through countries' pursuit of hydrocarbons, from Adolf Hitler's attempts to secure the Baku oil fields to Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait to last September's drone and missile attack on Saudi oil facilities.  Countries with oil and gas used their monopolies to sell the stuff for huge profits; those countries which relied on it spent much blood and treasure defending their access to it. The question is how much the renewable revolution might change this geopolitical equation. How much influence will be lost by some of the world's big fossil fuel producers, in the Middle East, Africa and elsewhere? Might there be more regional conflict as these countries fight over an ever-decreasing share of the hydrocarbon energy market? And what might happen to these countries internally if they lose their main source of revenue?  Often these are nations have huge state-led economies, with many workers employed by governments, with youthful populations accustomed to cheap fuel.  There is little consensus over when the transition from fossil fuels to clean energy will take place. There are many different predictions about when global demand for oil will peak and fall away but the planners at Shell recently forecast it could happen as early as 2025. So some oil-producing countries are playing safe and preparing for the moment when they can no longer rely on oil. They are looking to diversify their economies and find other sources of energy. But other countries are more sceptical, trusting that demand for their oil and gas will last for some time.  Some of these countries stand accused of talking about diversification but doing little about it. The potential consequences of this are becoming an increasing source of concern.  This is what Prof Paul Stevens, distinguished fellow at the UK foreign affairs think tank Chatham House, told the BBC: ""The oil producing government gets revenue; if that revenue falls or disappears, the government is no longer able to sustain the non-oil sector, which means you will have rising unemployment, you will no longer be able to pay subsidies to keep your population happy.  ""Many of the large oil and gas exporters are what might politely be described as politically unstable. So the faster the transition [to renewables], the greater the fall in gas and oil revenues, the more disruptive it is going to be and so you are looking at potentially a large number of failed states."" This is what Tom Burke, chairman of the E3G environmental think tank and a former UK government adviser says: ""If you can't deliver food, energy and water security, as we have seen across the Middle East, it is pretty difficult to deliver internal stability. Urban populations, when you fail to meet their expectations, riot. You could have the basic structures of the state fall apart.  ""But much more than that, when people riot or look like they might riot, what tends to happen in those situations in countries is they seek foreign adventures in order to distract people from their unmet expectations."" So just imagine a currently stable oil-producing country in the Gulf that suddenly becomes a failed state. Not only would this be a disaster for the country itself, but it could also have huge implications for the world.  Failed states often become the homes to extremist violence - think Syria - and they often produce mass migration. This potential disruption might not be confined to the Gulf. Russia is one of the biggest exporters of oil and gas in the world. Its economy and its government depend hugely on the revenues this brings in. Little wonder that President Putin describes the development of ""green technologies"" as a one of the ""main challenges and threats"" to Russia's economic security.  Many Russians remember that falling oil prices contributed to the collapse of the Soviet Union. But the current government is investing little in alternative renewable energies. If one day the world needs to buy less Russian gas, that could have a huge impact on the stability of the Russian state and could transform its relations with Europe. There are other potential sources of tension and conflict in a world of clean energy.  There could be a race to secure access to minerals such as cobalt and lithium which are vital for batteries and can be rare. Much of the world's best cobalt is located in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) which has a history of instability and poor governance.  At the same time, the new so-called super grids through which electricity will flow between countries will be more vulnerable to cyber-attack. An interesting question is how environmental campaigners should respond to the political risks involved in the move towards renewable energy. Should those potential downsides be taken into account or is the need to protect the world from climate change so paramount that all other considerations are secondary? How might public opinion be affected if reducing global warming meant more terrorism and migration?  These, of course, are some of the worst-case scenarios. There are many potential positives.  When the transition to renewables takes place, countries that were previously energy dependent will be able to produce their own power. One of the advantages of renewables is that many more countries have the ability to generate clean energy. Some countries with lots of sun, wind or tide could not only become self-sufficient but could also export some of their energy via huge so-called interconnectors. There may be something of a peace dividend: if the world no longer needs so much oil passing through the Strait of Hormuz each day, then perhaps they will not need such large armies and navies to defend it?  To a large extent, the geopolitics of energy may cease to be so significant. As Prof Stevens says, people will still find things to kill each other over, such as food and water.  But energy, maybe not so much. The World Turned Upside Down is on BBC World Service on Friday, 3 January and Saturday, 4 January. It will also be broadcast in two parts on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday, 5 January and Sunday, 12 January. It can also be heard on the BBC Sounds app."
geopolitical tensions,What's at stake for Biden in Ukraine?,2024-09-15,2022-02-04,By Barbara Plett Usher,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-60252837,"The construction of the Soviet Union's embassy in 1980s Washington DC had the plot twists of a spy novel.  The FBI tunnelled underneath the building to eavesdrop on the Russians, but their operation was betrayed by a double agent.   Today there is less intrigue but the tensions are back. Navigating them will be a critical test of President Joe Biden's leadership ability and his foreign policy vision of uniting Western democracies to confront autocratic regimes.   ""Hands off Ukraine"" has been his message since the Americans became alarmed by the Russian military build-up on its borders.  That was the chant of several dozen protesters who gathered recently outside the embassy, a massive square block of a building penetrated by rows of long narrow windows.   ""I think the US should be sending more lethal weapons to Ukraine,"" said Eihor Samokish. ""It would be sending a strong signal to Putin.""   The Russian president has been receiving mixed signals from Washington in recent years.   The plot twists triggered by Donald Trump's unabashed admiration of Putin complicated US policy. While the former American president was praising the Kremlin and disparaging Nato, the FBI was battling Russian election interference.  Biden promised to stand up to Russia's aggressive actions ""in a manner very different from my predecessor"". But what he wanted was a ""stable, predictable"" relationship in order to focus on dealing with the strategic challenge presented by China.   So he was caught on the back foot when Putin chose this moment to confront Nato over its post-Cold War expansion up to Russia's borders.   But Biden has since taken on the challenge with all the urgency of a Cold War crisis.   His administration is engaged in a relentless diplomatic drive to forge a united response with Europe, one that threatens severe economic sanctions for any invasion of Ukraine and bolsters its defences.  He has gone out of his way to involve allies at every step, a cornerstone of his foreign policy approach, but also reflecting lessons learned after the chaos of America's military withdrawal from Afghanistan, which dismayed allies.   That debacle also caught the Kremlin's attention.   ""I think it may have affected Putin's calculation, he may look at the United States and see we're in decline,"" says former Ambassador Daniel Fried, one of the architects of American policy after the fall of the Soviet Union.   ""But there was always a difference between the defence of Europe and defending a weak position in Afghanistan. It's like Vietnam. Failure and catastrophe in Vietnam did not mean that our defence of Western Europe was going to fall apart. It didn't. So I think Putin may have over-interpreted that.""   It's still the Kremlin, however, that's driving events. Putin's aggressive tactics are forcing reactions from Europe and the United States, and keeping them guessing about his intent.   ""We should think about Vladimir Putin as a poker player,"" says Ami Bera, a Democratic lawmaker who recently joined one of Congress' bipartisan solidarity tours to Ukraine. ""You don't know what hand he's holding: is this a bluff? Is he calling a strong hand?""  Straight-talking Joe Biden is not a master of bluff, but he does have cards to play. What sort of hand has he got?   He has been able to forge a level of unity across the Atlantic that the Kremlin may not have expected, over a response strong enough to give Putin reason to pause. In this the American president has been helped by the Russian leader, whose continued military build-up and demands to scale back Nato's presence in eastern Europe have proven effective rallying cries.  The Western military alliance, set adrift by the end of the Cold War, has been rejuvenated by the revival of its original mission - to defend Europe.   But there are splits within the European Union over how far to go with potential sanctions on Russia, and what exactly would trigger them. And if Russia takes aggressive action short of a full-scale military invasion, a unified response would become more difficult to maintain.   The strength of Biden's hand is being tested not only by potential military action.   His administration has offered Moscow negotiations on European security that fall far short of what Russia wants. But it is difficult to imagine Putin pulling back his forces without at least some concession on his core demand that Nato bar Ukraine from joining the alliance.   For the Biden administration Nato's ""open door"" policy - the right of membership to any European state that qualifies - is a red line.   But Ukraine doesn't qualify and probably won't for some time. There are murmurings in Washington of possible compromises. Thomas Graham - who managed White House dialogue with Moscow when George W Bush was president - has proposed a moratorium, or pause, on Ukraine membership  ""This is not an abandonment of Ukraine,"" he says. ""This is an effort to try to take Ukraine out of the crosshairs of an intense geopolitical competition.""   Trump loyalists in Congress have also questioned the prudence of supporting Ukraine's Nato membership at the risk of a long drawn-out conflict with Russia. And Democratic Senator Dick Durbin has hinted at a solution on similar lines, stressing that it's the decision of Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky  ""If he decides that the future membership, if there's to be one, in Nato for Ukraine, and the question of Russian occupation of Ukraine are two things to put on the table, I think we may move toward a solution to this,"" he recently told NBC.  Washington's foreign policy establishment, on the other hand, sees any accommodation to Putin's demands over Ukraine as surrendering the victory of the Cold War.   When engaging in battle with autocracy, Biden ""has to mean it"", says Daniel Fried.  ""You have to be prepared to deal with Putin as an aggressive dictator, a tyrant and act accordingly. By which I mean, don't think that this is going to be settled within the timeline of a Washington media story, you know, a couple of weeks. You better get prepared for something longer.""   President Biden is aware that China - which he's described as the main autocratic challenge to democracy - is closely watching how he handles Russia. Increasingly the leaders of both countries are finding common cause in the face of Western pressure - no image better captures that than their photo-op from the Beijing Olympics.  President Biden has billed this kind of ideological confrontation as the essence of his foreign policy vision.  The Ukraine crisis is a crucial test of whether he can pull it off.  "
geopolitical tensions,US-China tensions flare at UN General Assembly,2024-09-15,2020-09-22,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-54253408,"Tensions between the US and China came to the fore of the annual UN General Assembly in New York, with US President Donald Trump blaming China for the spread of coronavirus. He called for China to be held ""accountable"" for the pandemic.   In his speech, Chinese President Xi Jinping said his country had ""no intention to enter a Cold War with any country"". Ties between the two world powers are strained on a number of fronts. This year's summit at New York is largely being held virtually, with world leaders providing pre-recorded speeches. The new format meant some of the geopolitical theatre normally on offer at the key UN meeting was absent. Each country was represented by a single delegate and there was little opportunity for one nation to rebut another.  But as often is the case for speeches to the assembly, President Trump used his address to tout his achievements and tear into a rival. ""We must hold accountable the nation which unleashed this plague on to the world - China,"" he said.  ""In the earliest days of the virus China locked down travel domestically, while allowing flights to leave China and infect the world. China condemned my travel ban on their country, even as they cancelled domestic flights and locked citizens in their homes,"" he added.  President Trump, whose own record on coronavirus is under close scrutiny as the US heads towards elections, has frequently accused Beijing of covering up the virus, saying they could have stopped the disease spreading. China has called the attacks an unfounded distraction. The US death toll for coronavirus, at more than 200,000, is the highest in the world and President Trump has often downplayed the disease.  Tensions are high between the US and China on a number of other issues, including trade, technology, Hong Kong and China's treatment of Muslim minorities in Xinjiang province.  Speaking soon after the US leader, President Xi warned of the risks of a ""clash of civilisations"". ""We will continue to narrow differences and resolve disputes with others through dialogue and negotiation. We will not seek to develop only ourselves or engage in zero sum game,"" he said.  In remarks released ahead of Tuesday's speech, President Xi took a more overt swipe at the US, saying ""no country has the right to dominate global affairs, control the destiny of others, or keep advantages in development all to itself"", something China itself has been accused of by critics.   Also in his speech, President Xi said China - the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases - aims to hit peak emissions in 2030 and be carbon neutral by 2060.  By Laura Trevelyan, BBC News This was a stump speech by President Trump, who faces re-election in 40 days time. He had Beijing firmly in his sights - blaming what he and his followers call the China virus for taking countless lives.  Mr Trump is trying to deflect attention from his own handling of the pandemic by heaping opprobrium on China, while emphasising US efforts to find a cure.  We will end the pandemic, the president pledged, saying thanks to US efforts three vaccines are in the final stage of development. For good measure, Mr Trump lumped the UN's World Health Organization into his critique of China - saying the international body, which he's withdrawing US funding from, is virtually controlled by China, blaming it for spreading what he called misinformation about the virus.  This was not a subtle speech. It was a clear attempt to shift blame as Americans are already voting in the presidential election. The assembly was opened by UN Secretary-General António Guterres, who, without naming China or the US warned ""we must do everything to avoid a new Cold War"". ""We are moving in a very dangerous direction,"" he said. ""Our world cannot afford a future where the two largest economies split the globe in a great fracture - each with its own trade and financial rules and internet and artificial intelligence capacities."" He said there was no room for self-interest in the face of the coronavirus. ""Populism and nationalism have failed,"" he said. ""Those approaches to contain the virus have often made things manifestly worse."" President Trump gave a very different vision in his speech, saying ""only when you take care of your own citizens will you find a true basis for co-operation"".  In other speeches:"
geopolitical tensions,Does the diplomatic boycott of Beijing 2022 matter?,2024-09-15,2021-12-13,By Dan Roan,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-59646231,"While concern over human rights has become almost a constant theme in international sport in recent years, few hosts of major events have provoked quite as much controversy as Beijing.  The venue for the 2022 Winter Olympics has been hit by a flurry of diplomatic boycotts from countries including the US, Australia, and Britain, because of widespread allegations of Chinese atrocities against the Uyghur community. Human rights groups and Western governments have accused China of genocide in the Xinjiang region. China denies this, saying its network of detention camps there is for ""re-education"" of the Uyghurs and other Muslims.  Relations are also strained over a crackdown on political freedoms and pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong, and more recently concerns over tennis player Peng Shuai, who disappeared from public view after she accused a top Chinese government official of sexual assault. Although the Chinese authorities have criticised ""malicious speculation"" over her case, there remains significant concern about her.  For the few Western governments who have said their representatives will not attend, such a move is a relatively easy way to be seen to issue a rebuke, while avoiding the much more contentious step of preventing athletes from competing via a full boycott.  It is not a new tactic. Three years ago some European countries, including Britain, announced diplomatic boycotts of the Russian football World Cup after the Salisbury Novichok poisoning.  The risk with sending politicians to Beijing to attend the Games is that inevitably it would be viewed as offering tacit approval of the government of President Xi Jinping, for whom the event is a matter of significant prestige.  While China accused the US of using the Games for political manipulation and vowed ""resolute counter-measures"", it is unlikely to have been too dismayed, or indeed surprised, especially given the likes of Italy and France have declined to join the boycott, with President Macron describing it as ""symbolic and insignificant"". Certainly it will make very little difference to the spectacle of the event for those inside venues or watching from afar.  While the coalition of Tibetan, Uyghur, Southern Mongolian, Hong Kong, and Taiwanese rights groups that make up the #NoBeijing2022 campaign welcomed the diplomatic boycotts, many campaigners feel they do not go far enough, and that athletes themselves, corporate sponsors and major broadcasters also need to act if pressure really is to be brought to bear on China.  Some ask - if a full boycott is not appropriate now, in a country that stands accused of genocide, when will it ever be? Indeed, the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) has been widely praised in the West for effectively boycotting China by suspending all tournaments there in response to continued questions over Peng Shuai's condition, a rare example of a sports body prepared to take such a stand against a country that is such a key commercial market.  Refusing to participate in the Olympics would perhaps do more to raise awareness of the violations that China stands accused of, and taking part risks appearing complicit - but it would also seem very unfair on innocent athletes who have spent years preparing for such an opportunity.  Those opposed to such a step insist that the Cold War boycotts of the Games in 1980 and 1984 had minimal political impact, with athletes ultimately the ones who were punished. Others, however, point to the sporting boycotts of apartheid South Africa in the 1970s and 80s as evidence that such an approach can play a crucial role in applying pressure to a country's rulers.  Some flip this argument on its head, insisting that engaging in sporting competition, rather than boycotting, ensures the opportunity for valuable sporting diplomacy, and means international scrutiny, both of which can result in positive change. This is an argument the FA uses when asked about participating in the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, where despite reforms, workers' rights remain a major concern for human rights organisations, and homosexuality is illegal.  ""Our view remains that change is best achieved by working collaboratively with others so that we can continue to ask the right questions while always being mindful that we also have our own human rights challenges in this country,"" the governing body said in a recent statement. ""As a legacy of the upcoming World Cup, we also see the opportunity for dialogue and engagement that can lead to real change beyond the borders of Qatar and into neighbouring countries in the region where there are also still some challenges regarding human rights."" Not everyone agrees. There seems little evidence of any such progress in China after the Beijing summer Games in 2008, nor indeed in Russia after it staged the 2014 Winter Olympics and the 2018 World Cup.  But while there seems little appetite among athletes, governments or sports fans for a full boycott of Beijing 2022, could competitors still make a difference once there? It would be no surprise given the renewed activism of recent years, with more and more athletes speaking out about a range of social issues, from racism and women's rights, to mental health and the environment.  Although recently relaxed, the IOC's Rule 50 still seriously restricts what Olympians can say or do during the event, forbidding any form of political protest, demonstration or propaganda on the podium, at official ceremonies, or on the field of play. Freedom of speech is allowed in press areas, mixed zones and on social media, but whether athletes will take up that opportunity in a country criticised for censorship and the intimidation of foreign journalists is debatable. Especially after WTA Chairman Steve Simon recently said that he was ""greatly concerned about the risks that all of our players and staff could face if we were to hold events in China in 2022.""  It certainly seems the Chinese authorities do not take kindly to condemnation from sports stars. Outspoken Boston Celtics basketball star Enes Kanter sparked a major backlash when he was critical of President Xi and expressed support for the Free Tibet movement in October. His name was blocked from Chinese social media site Weibo, and the streaming of Celtics games was reportedly cancelled. Similarly, an Arsenal game was pulled from Chinese state television in 2019 after its former midfielder Mesut Ozil highlighted the treatment of the Uyghurs.  Many human rights groups have pleaded with the IOC to find a new location for the event. At this late stage, there is no prospect of that, of course. But the intense controversy surrounding Beijing 2022 has reinforced scrutiny over the organisation's choice of hosts and its relationship with them.  Human Rights Watch recently accused the IOC of ""collaboration"" with the Chinese after its President Thomas Bach held a video call with three-time Olympian Ms Peng in a bid to alleviate concerns. The IOC reject this accusation, and has defended its use of ""quiet diplomacy"". But it will have troubled many that when asked how China's record on human rights was compatible with the Olympic values, its longest-serving board member Dick Pound said he had no regrets about Beijing's selection as host and that he ""did not know"" about alleged atrocities, despite mounting evidence. ""You can berate me all you like about my not knowing, but I don't know for sure,"" he told Deutschlandfunk Sport on Monday. The IOC, he said, ""has no role to play in bringing about political change... when we award the Games to a country we don't do it as an indication that we support the political objectives of that country."" Critics firmly reject the IOC's insistence that it is entirely neutral and is above politics. They point, for example, to the talks that the organisation facilitated between North and South Korea in 2018.  And the way President Vladimir Putin hoped to use Sochi 2014 to project to the world the power of both Russia and himself.  What is certain is that while it was not the athletes' choice to select Beijing to host the Games, as geopolitical tensions rise, they are the ones now facing renewed questions about whether it is right to compete there, and left to decide what they should do once they arrive.  Many feel they have been placed in an impossible position. "
geopolitical tensions,Beirut violence fuels fears of return to civil war,2024-09-15,2021-10-27,By Jim Muir,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-59035123,"My friend and neighbour Richard was starting a series of online meetings at his office on the south-east edge of Beirut when all hell suddenly broke loose.  He spent the next three hours sheltering on the ground floor as the sounds of war raged around the building, triggering a rush of traumatic memories for someone who had lived through 15 years of civil conflict from 1975 on. ""All the memories of the civil war flashed back into my mind,"" he said. ""It was very intense, feelings of anger, of fear, of anxiety, especially about my children. I felt that they will be living what I lived during the civil war."" When Richard later arrived home safely, he suddenly burst into tears.  ""I don't know why, and the next day I was not able to function at all. It seems the war trauma came back to me again. I didn't want this to happen to me and my children."" For Richard and many other Lebanese people, the sudden eruption of sectarian clashes in the capital on 14 October rang strident alarm bells.  Political tensions were very high, the economy was collapsing, electricity and fuel were almost non-existent, prices were soaring - and now gunmen were battling it out in the streets again.  Was the country teetering on the brink of another civil war? One of many reasons why the clashes had such resonance was the location. The Christian suburb of Ain al-Remmaneh on the south-east edge of Beirut was where the civil war began in April 1975, after a series of incidents culminated in the shooting-up by Christian militiamen of a busload of Palestinians, killing more than 20.  For the next 15 years, Ain al-Remmaneh was on the front line of a mutating civil war, confronting the adjacent, largely Shia Muslim suburb of Chiyah.  It was from Chiyah that a band of Shia protesters triggered the clashes on 14 October by rampaging into Ain al-Remmaneh chanting provocative sectarian slogans: ""Shia, Shia, Shia!"" All seven of those killed in the ensuing gunfire were Shia, including some from the Iranian-backed Hezbollah movement and the allied Amal faction.  The incident triggered a virulent exchange of accusations and denials between the Hezbollah-led Shia alliance and the Christian Lebanese Forces (LF) party.  Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah accused the LF of sending snipers to fire from rooftops in an attempt to kindle a civil war into which, he said, Hezbollah would not be drawn.  He warned that he could command 100,000 fighters, with the implication that he could trounce his opponents if he had to.  The LF leader, Samir Geagea, retorted that his party did not have a militia and was not seeking war. He accused Hezbollah of trying to cover up involvement in the massive explosion at Beirut port in August last year by pushing for the dismissal of the investigating judge - the issue that prompted the Shia demonstration. Back in 1975, few observers predicted that a full-scale civil war was about to erupt. And once it did, few of us imagined that it would go on in different forms for 15 years, creating fault lines which are clearly still there today.  So protestations of innocent intentions, and even objective assessments of balances of power, do not necessarily mean it might not happen again. When political deadlock is intense, miscalculations can be made. Once blood is shed, conflict can take on a life of its own, especially in a situation of sectarian animosity.  Political confrontation and polarisation are already there. During the Ain al-Remmaneh clashes, Sunnis in nearby areas, and Christians in East Beirut's Ashrafieh district, were on alert, fearing another ""7th of May"" - the day in 2008 when Hezbollah fighters invaded West Beirut to crush Sunni and Druze opponents.  ""If the clashes had involved Sunnis rather than Christians, trouble would have erupted all over the country within an hour,"" said a well-placed Sunni military source, indicating that Sunnis are nursing a virulent grudge against Hezbollah. ""People have had it up to their necks, and a clash with Hezbollah would have been the last straw."" ""I don't see a civil war tomorrow morning, it will take time, but it will erupt with time,"" said a veteran politician. ""There will be more incidents... this is how it started in 1975. How can you stop it?"" There was a geopolitical engine driving the conflict in 1975, and there is another one now.  Then, the right-wing Christian factions (which later morphed into the LF) were set on destroying the power of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) and the state within a state it had established.  They were unable to do so on their own, so they drew in first Syria (1976) and then Israel to help, culminating in the 1982 Israeli invasion which drove out Yasser Arafat and the PLO. Now the LF are facing another state within the state, this time run by Hezbollah. It was the only faction allowed to retain arms after the Taif peace agreement of 1989 which brought a halt to the civil war, because of its role as a ""defender of Lebanon against Israel"".  Since then it has built up a formidable and secretive military capability, reckoned to be much stronger than the Lebanese army, as well as a big network of social services, hospitals and other structures.  The difference with the PLO is that Hezbollah is Lebanese. But its affiliation with Iran - it is widely seen as an Iranian proxy - lends a strong geopolitical dimension to any potential conflict.  ""The Iranians and Americans are fighting one another in Lebanon, and in Iraq, and in Yemen,"" said a political source. ""You have to see the big picture."" While Hezbollah is deeply engaged with Iran, there is a widely-held if undocumented belief that the LF leader Samir Geagea is receiving substantial funding from Iran's regional rival, Saudi Arabia.  One factor arguing against a major flare-up is the obvious imbalance of power, underlined by Hassan Nasrallah's unneeded reminder to Samir Geagea that he could marshal 100,000 fighters.  Everybody knows that Hezbollah could fight its way into every corner of the country in a matter of days.  But that would be to embroil the movement in a running domestic war without end, one that would see it facing not only Samir Geagea's LF, but also the Sunnis and perhaps the Druze.  Invading Christian areas would destroy Hezbollah's alliance with Samir Geagea's Christian rivals, the Free Patriotic Movement of President Michel Aoun and his powerful son-in-law Gebran Bassil, leaving it dangerously exposed. That alliance is already under strain because of Hezbollah's opposition to the investigation of the port explosion of August 2020, the victims of which were mainly Christian.  The Ain al-Remmaneh clashes have already had the effect of enhancing Samir Geagea's standing in the Christian community, according to many Christian sources, and even among some Sunnis.  But by aggravating sectarian tensions and reinforcing mental and physical boundaries, they were also seen as serving the leaderships on both sides, rallying the faithful in the run-up to early parliamentary elections set for 27 March.  Lebanon's economic collapse, heavily blamed on the greed and corruption of the political class, had brought leaders into public disrepute across the board, with Hezbollah no exception.  ""There is no solution in Lebanon involving elimination of Hezbollah except by a full war, which the Lebanese cannot undertake,"" said a Christian veteran of the civil war.  ""Hezbollah is there and we have to live with it. The best bet is to fully empower the Lebanese Army, and strengthen opposition to Hezbollah in parliament. They have to adapt to a political compromise."" That is a tall order. In the meantime, the best the Lebanese can hope for is that the predicted future incidents will be contained, and living conditions perhaps slightly improved by the fragile new government.  The worst does not bear thinking about.  Jim Muir moved to Lebanon in January 1975 and covered the civil war there from the beginning, much of the time as a BBC Middle East correspondent."
geopolitical tensions,EU looks for role in Russian row with West,2024-09-15,2022-01-06,By Nick Beake,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-59878710,"It was the man who brought stability first to a flailing eurozone and then most recently to turbulent Italian politics who neatly articulated Europe's weakness in dealing with Russia.  Mario Draghi, for now Italy's prime minister, lamented that the continent didn't have the collective military might to deter Moscow amid its troop build-up on the Ukrainian border.  ""Do we have missiles, ships, cannons, armies?"" he asked rhetorically on the eve of Christmas. ""At the moment we don't."" If Italy's so-called ""Super Mario"" feels powerless, then what hope for everyone else?  The Italian leader is not alone in his deep frustration that Europe is being excluded from the key conversations about the biggest security issue in its backyard.  The EU has been sidelined as Presidents Biden and Putin talk to each other directly - demonstrated most notably by their video call last month, the opening moments of which were released.  Brussels, like the rest of us, could only look at the screen as the game of high-stakes, bilateral diplomacy began: a virtual bystander not given the password to log in. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell's visit to the front line in Ukraine on Wednesday has been an attempt to prise open a door to greater involvement. Discussion on the security of Europe and Ukraine must include Europeans and Ukrainians, he told reporters.  But a single visit will not reconfigure the EU's role, or lack of it, in dealing with the latest episode of Putin muscle-flexing.  ""Russia simply does not see the EU as a powerful or strong player in the game,"" says Tinatin Akhvlediani of the Centre for European Policy Studies in Brussels. ""The EU has shown over recent years it has many internal disagreements when it comes to its own foreign policy, defence, security issues and over co-operation with Nato.""  She believes the EU should lay out a coherent, long-term strategy for a bigger role in its relationship with Ukraine, and she is encouraged it is the destination of Mr Borrell's first trip of 2022. At least this latest venture eastwards to engage with Russia has been more successful that his previous one. The EU's top diplomat was humiliated on three counts last February when he travelled to Moscow: Certainly the EU would crave a fraction of the political weight the US still carries on the world stage.  On the day of Mr Borrell's Ukraine visit, arguably the more significant European foreign affairs trip was Germany's new foreign minister's to Washington.  Anna Baerbock, co-leader of the Greens, has taken a tougher approach on Russia, and China, and that is welcomed by the Biden administration. But just because a senior German minister speaks the same diplomatic language as the fluent French-speaking Secretary of State Antony Blinken, that doesn't translate to bigger EU influence on the Russia and Ukraine situation.  As always it's the hotline to the leaders' offices in individual European capitals where the power lies - not in the EU's European External Action Service in the centre of Brussels. The big concern for the EU is not just that it's left out in the cold over non-EU member Ukraine, but that it will be frozen out of discussions on its entire eastern flank.    Ahead of US-Russia talks in Geneva on 10 January, President Putin has used the escalation in tensions to present radical, new demands that he claims would help calm the situation.  Chiefly, Moscow would have a veto on Ukraine membership of Nato - and remember an attack on one Nato member constitutes an attack on all. Also, the security landscape in Eastern Europe would be rolled back 25 years to a time when the likes of Poland and the Baltic states Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia had not yet joined the EU or Nato.  While it's unthinkable that the West would seriously consider the proposals, they are now part of a conversation Russia has initiated on its terms and it will want to discuss them further in Geneva. Nato has managed to play a more prominent role than the EU and is convening foreign ministers this week.   The Putin demand for no further Nato expansion in Europe has been met with consternation by countries such as Finland and Sweden. Both are already EU members and insist it should be their choice if they wish to join the alliance.  ""None of us really know what the Kremlin's actual game plan is,"" says Kadri Liik of the European Council on Foreign Relations.  She doubts the US would allow meaningful discussions about Europe's geopolitical order and security order to get under way without European leaders being involved, but says there needs to be a realism in how much the EU can achieve in its quest for a seat at the top table.  ""I don't see a silver bullet. The EU is a different sort of animal, and it will probably never be a foreign policy actor similar to powerful nation states like Russia or the United States."" Ms Liik believes the best action is to harness the collective might of 27 economies, as the EU will never have its own army. Redefining Europe's mission on the world stage will not be quick or simple. And in the short term, there are plenty of national distractions:   France's President Macron is squarely focused on re-election in April and Germany's new three-party coalition government is just finding its feet. Italy has enjoyed political stability since Mario Draghi became leader last year, but it is now convulsed by a search for a new president - a role he may jump to. The EU may not like it but Washington and Moscow are the two main characters taking centre stage.   "
geopolitical tensions,Welsh plant critical to microchip shortage - boss,2024-09-15,2022-05-26,By Huw Thomas,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-61587091,"A south Wales factory could prove ""critical"" to addressing the global shortage of semiconductors. Welsh company IQE produces wafers for a range of electronic devices around the world. Apple iPhones are understood to be among the devices that use parts made at the plant in Newport. The company's new chief executive, Americo Lemos, said ""time is of the essence"" to expand capacity once funding is in place. He has begun discussions with Welsh and UK governments about funding its expansion, while private backing is also being pursued. ""Newport is critical. We are building products here that go all around the globe [for] different types of technologies, different types of end-product that really enhance people's lives,"" said Mr Lemos. ""And this is what I'm excited about. As we grow the site here, with the right investment level, we will be able to proliferate our product all around the world."" Semiconductors, also known as microchips or chips, allow electricity to flow through devices and are the fundamental components of everything from smart phones to the vast data centres powering the internet. However, supplies have been restricted since the Covid pandemic, with some manufacturers cancelling or delaying products as they wait for the vital components to be produced. IQE's Newport site, based at the former LG factory in Duffryn, has vast unoccupied areas which the company says can be quickly utilised to expand production. Mr Lemos said he hoped government funding would come quickly. ""The semiconductor shortage has impacted a very large part of the economy, like the automotive [sector] and all those areas of our daily lives,"" he said. ""Therefore, the cost of not having those products is much higher than the investment needed to make it happen."" The Welsh government welcomed IQE's plans to expand, adding: ""There needs to be a clear and coherent approach to the semiconductor industry in the UK, this will need governments to work together and with the sector."" Newport is home to several companies that are collectively known as the semiconductor cluster. IQE, established in the 1980s, produces a type of epitaxy wafer in Newport which is a vital component of compound semiconductors. ""The stuff that we make here we will be impacting your life on a daily basis,"" said Mr Lemos. The UK government has ordered a security review into Chinese influence on the semiconductor sector following the takeover of Newport Wafer Fab by Nexperia, a Dutch company owned by Shanghai firm Wingtech. ""We all understand the geopolitical tensions we live in,"" Mr Lemos said. ""But we are a global company and we intend to work in every market possible where there is business, within the framework that exists today.  ""So I'm more excited than nervous, actually, for the future of the company here and the site we are in."""
geopolitical tensions,India and US sign crucial defence deal,2024-09-15,2020-10-27,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-54655947,"India and the US have signed a military agreement on sharing sensitive satellite data amid Delhi's tense border standoff with Beijing. Access to such data is considered vital for hitting missiles, drones and other targets with precision.  The deal was announced after the annual ""2+2"" high-level talks in Delhi on Tuesday. Experts say the strengthening of India-US ties is aimed at countering China's influence in the region. US Defence Secretary Mark Esper held talks with his Indian counterpart Rajnath Singh. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also met Indian Foreign Minister S Jaishankar. ""Over [the] last two decades, our bilateral relationship has grown steadily in its substance, facets and significance,"" Mr Jaishankar said on Tuesday. He added that the talks would enable the two countries to ""engage much more intensively on matters of national security"".  The Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement on Geospatial Cooperation, or BECA, is among the few deals that the US signs with close partners. It allows India access to a range of sensitive geospatial and aeronautical data that is crucial for military action.  The two sides also signed a clutch of other deals in the fields of nuclear energy, earth sciences and alternative medicine. But BECA is the most significant deal among them. It will allow the US to ""provide advanced navigational aids and avionics on US-supplied aircraft to India"", an Indian defence source told Reuters news agency - that also means the US can fit high-end navigational equipment in the aircraft it supplies to India. Its signing comes at a time when India is locked in one of its most hostile standoffs with China along their disputed border in the Himalayan region.  Twenty Indian soldiers died in a clash that erupted  between troops on both sides in June, sparking months-long rounds of diplomatic talks to ease tensions. But that has not helped to de-escalate hostilities so far.  Relations between the US and China have also soured in recent months with President Donald Trump's repeated criticism of Beijing's handling of the coronavirus pandemic. The US has also rebuked China for imposing a new security law in Hong Kong, following large-scale protests.  The deal is another step forward in deepening India-US military ties. India is one of the word's biggest defence equipment buyers, but around 60-70% of its inventory is supplied by Russia. Rajini Vaidyanathan , BBC News, Delhi In sign of the times, hand sanitiser stations were placed in front of the press cordon, and everyone, including the politicians, were wearing a mask.  That two of America's most senior Cabinet ministers chose to travel in person to meet their counterparts during times of Covid, and a week before the US presidential vote, is an indication of just how important these talks were. Countering the influence of China in the region is the overarching theme of this trip - US officials will also travel to Sri Lanka, the Maldives and Indonesia in the coming days - nations which enjoy strong ties with Beijing. The US wants to change this and has become one of the fastest-growing defence suppliers for India in recent years. Echoes of such plans can be heard in the statements of both countries' leaders. This visit will reinforce US and India's ""commitment to deepening military-to-military co-operation,"" an official statement said after Mr Esper met Mr Singh on Monday.  ""Our talks today were fruitful, aimed at further deepening defence co-operation in a wide range of areas,"" Mr Singh later tweeted.  This is the third round of the ""two-plus-two"" annual dialogue between India and the US.  The first one was held in Delhi in 2018. The latest one, originally scheduled for earlier this year, was delayed due to the pandemic and comes just a week shy of US election results. Analysts say that the timing is significant and highlights India as a priority for the US.  Vikas Pandey, BBC News, Delhi The deal is key, given the current geopolitical scenario. The US seems to have sensed an opportunity in the India-China border standoff and wants to further raise its profile in the region. It's being seen as a signal to China that Washington considers Delhi a close military ally. And this is likely to bolster the Trump administration's anti-China rhetoric.  But  Indian officials will have to walk a tight diplomatic rope.  Delhi continues to hold military-level talks with Beijing to de-escalate the situation at the border and a peaceful resolution is in its best interest. It will not want a conflict, even a limited one, at a time when it's fighting a long-haul battle against the pandemic. This was evident from the statements made by the leaders of the two countries at a joint press conference on Tuesday. While Mr Singh and Mr Jaishankar did not directly mention China in their statements, both Mr Esper and Mr Pompeo took swipes at China.  India will also be mindful of its relations with Russia. So it will be interesting to see how it balances its military and strategic ties with both Washington and Moscow."
geopolitical tensions,Why South Koreans want the nuclear bomb,2024-09-15,2023-04-21,By Jean Mackenzie,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-65333139," Hidden away in the private room of an underground restaurant in Seoul, a disparate group of South Koreans have gathered for a clandestine lunch. Among the mix are politicians, scientists, and military people, some of whose identities are too sensitive to reveal. This is the meeting of the newly formed Forum for Nuclear Strategy, and their lunchtime agenda is ambitious - to plot out how South Korea can develop nuclear weapons. This once-fringe idea has exploded into the mainstream over the past months. Even South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol raised the possibility during a defence meeting, making him the only president to have put this option on the table in recent times. Now newspaper columns trumpet the idea daily, while a staggering three-quarters of the public support it. South Koreans have grown anxious about their nuclear-armed neighbour to the north, and on Wednesday Mr Yoon is heading to the White House, seeking President Joe Biden's help. South Korea previously flirted with the idea of developing nuclear weapons in the 1970s, when it ran a secret programme. But when the United States found out, it issued an ultimatum: Seoul could carry on, or have the US defend it, with the full force of its existing nuclear arsenal. It picked US support, and to this day tens of thousands of US troops remain stationed on the Korean peninsula. Since then, the geopolitical situation has shifted dramatically. North Korea is building ever-more sophisticated nuclear weapons that can target cities across the US, leaving people to question whether Washington would still come to South Korea's defence. Here is the scenario they chew over: a belligerent Kim Jong-un attacks South Korea, forcing the US to intervene. Mr Kim then threatens to detonate a nuclear bomb over the US mainland unless it withdraws from the war. What does Washington do? Does it risk having San Francisco reduced to rubble to save Seoul? Probably not, is the conclusion those at the secret lunchtime meeting have come to.  ""It is irrational to think another country should protect us. This is our problem and our responsibility,"" said Choi Ji-young, a forum member and member of South Korea's ruling People Power Party. The chairman of the forum, academic Cheong Seong-chang, presented their suggested plan. The next time the North tests a nuclear weapon, Seoul would withdraw from the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). If, within six months, Mr Kim has not agreed to discuss giving up some of his weapons, Seoul would start building its own. Mr Cheong argues that this would reduce the probability of a nuclear war on the Korean peninsula, as Mr Kim would be less likely to attack, knowing the South could strike back. But Jenny Town, from the US-based think tank 38 North, challenges the assumption that a nuclear-armed South would make the North less adventurous. ""More nuclear weapons does not make the world safer from nuclear use,"" she said. ""If you look at India and Pakistan as an example, this is not what we have seen. If anything, being nuclear-armed has sort of given them both the green light to go a little further."" A nuclear-armed South Korea is absolutely not what Washington wants. Yet, this beast is partly of America's making. In 2016, then-President Donald Trump accused South Korea of free-riding. He threatened to make Seoul pay for the US troops stationed on its soil, or else he would withdraw them. The fear those words instilled in people has not lessened with time. An increasing number of South Koreans, acutely aware that America's promises are only as good as its next leader, now favour building the bomb.  On a recent Sunday afternoon, at a local sauna in Seoul, people young and old from all backgrounds gathered to ease their weekly aches, while indulging in beer and fried chicken. While it might seem strange to discuss nuclear proliferation in such a setting, these days, it is almost in the realm of small talk.  ""The US is not going to use its nukes to defend us, so we should be in control of our own defence,"" said 31-year-old Koo Sung-wook, who swayed this way during his time in the military. He served in 2010, during a major crisis when North Korea shelled a South Korean island, killing four people. ""It felt like a total emergency. Units were calling their parents and writing wills,"" he recounted. Now he worries not just about North Korea, but China too. ""We are surrounded by these great powers and walking on eggshells around them. To be competitive, we need to have nukes.""  Almost everyone at the sauna agreed, even 82-year-old Hong In-su. A child during the Korean War in the 1950s, she said she was anti-nuclear weapons, before reluctantly concluding they were a necessary evil: ""Other countries are developing theirs, so I don't see how we can go on without them. The world is changing."" Another woman was torn over whether the US would defend South Korea, and thought it ""better to have nukes just in case"", while a young mother worried that Seoul's current relationship with the US could change at any moment. Washington is now scrambling to reassure its ally of its ""iron-clad"" commitment to its defence. Earlier this month it stationed a gigantic nuclear-powered aircraft carrier in the southern port of Busan. But to the frustration of US policymakers, such reassuring gestures no longer seem to be working.  Seoul's politicians have grown wary of being kept in the dark, unclear about what would trigger the US president to push the nuclear button on their behalf. Currently, there is no requirement for Mr Biden to even tell Mr Yoon before doing so. ""At the very least we could build in a mandatory phone call, so long as it is understood that this is still the US president's decision,"" Ms Town said. Yang Uk, a defence analyst with the Seoul-based Asan Institute, was in the room with President Yoon when he made his remarks about South Korea going nuclear. He claims Mr Yoon was indirectly pressuring the US. ""The US is so reluctant to discuss its nuclear policy with South Korea and yet if a nuclear war broke out on the peninsula we are the ones who would suffer the most,"" he said. Seoul is pushing to be more involved in the planning and execution around nuclear use. That could mean having US nuclear weapons stationed in South Korea, or to have a nuclear sharing arrangement, similar to that in Europe, where South Korea is able to use US weapons in the event of a war. A less drastic option would be to create a joint nuclear-planning group. The US is unlikely to offer up much, but knows it must deliver something concrete that President Yoon can chalk up as a win, and sell to the South Korean public. Even so, it may prove too late. This once inconceivable idea is now so firmly planted in the South Korean psyche, it is difficult to see how it can be uprooted. Going nuclear is a mammoth decision. The current international order is built on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, and those that threaten this order, such as Iran and North Korea, have paid a high price. Analysts say the South Korean public has probably not considered the consequences. The US could pull out of its defence commitment, China might retaliate ferociously by hounding South Korea with sanctions, and their country could end up isolated, another failed pariah state, its dazzling international reputation in tatters. At the sauna, people seemed unperturbed by these scenarios. Only one woman conceded that if it meant South Korea becoming ""an axis of evil"" then it was probably not worth it. But that is unlikely to happen. South Korea is too strategically and economically important for it to be shunned like North Korea. Most analysts do not even believe the US would end its decades-long military alliance. Instead, the concern is that a potential South Korean nuclear armament would create such a crack in the non-proliferation regime, it would cause other countries to follow. Only 82-year-old Hong In-su seemed to grapple with the dangers ahead. She quoted a Korean proverb that roughly translates to ""you fall in your own poop"", or in other words, this could seriously backfire. ""I do think nuclear weapons will come back to harm us,"" she said. ""I feel bad for the next generation."""
geopolitical tensions,F-35C fighter jet recovered from South China Sea,2024-09-15,2022-03-03,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-60607784,"The US Navy has said it has retrieved a stealth fighter jet from the depths of the South China Sea where it sank after a ""mishap"" in January.  A major operation was launched to recover the $100m (£74m) F-35C jet - the newest, most advanced in the US force. The aircraft ended up in at the bottom of the South China Sea following a landing problem on the USS Carl Vinson. The region has been a source of rising US-China tensions in recent years. The F-35C Lightning II was retrieved on Wednesday from a depth of 12,400 feet (3,780 metres) using a remotely operated vehicle that fastened rigging and lift lines to the aircraft. A hook was lowered from a diving support ship's crane to the sea floor, which was attached to the rigging. The jet was then lifted to the surface and hoisted aboard the vessel.  ""The recovery effort shows the US Navy's commitment to its assets, and a free and open Indo-Pacific,"" the Navy said in a statement.  Seven sailors were injured in the crash earlier this year, when the F-35C struck the deck of aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson in a crash landing made during a military exercise.  The single-engine stealth fighter impacted the flight deck of the 100,00-tonne aircraft carrier and then fell into the sea, the Navy said. The pilot was ejected to safety and rescued in a helicopter.  The South China Sea, home to vital shipping lanes, has been a geopolitical flashpoint for years, with several countries claiming ownership of its small islands and reefs and with it, access to its resources. China has taken increasingly forceful steps to assert its claim of the territory, refusing to recognise a 2016 international tribunal ruling saying there was no evidence that China had historically exercised exclusive control over the waters."
geopolitical tensions,Japan PM in South East Asia push,2024-09-15,2013-01-16,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-21038440,"This video can not be played Mr Abe ""wants Japanese companies to expand beyond the traditional investment destinations,"" says Rupert Wingfield-Hayes Japan's Shinzo Abe is visiting South East Asia, in his first overseas tour as prime minister. Mr Abe, who was elected in December, is visiting Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia in what is being seen as a diplomatic push into the region. Economic ties are expected to top the agenda but rumbling territorial rows with China are also set to come up. Mr Abe's first stop was in Hanoi, which like Japan is engaged in a maritime dispute with Beijing. Japan and China have contesting claims to East China Sea islands, while Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia and Taiwan all have overlapping claims with Beijing in the South China Sea. Before leaving Japan, Mr Abe told reporters he wanted to make his first foreign trip the start of his government's ""strategic diplomacy"". ""Currently, the strategic environment in the Asia-Pacific region is going through a dynamic change. During this change, having closer relations with Asean countries contributes to the region's peace and stability and is in Japan's national interest."" Following talks in Hanoi with his Vietnamese counterpart, Nguyen Tan Dung, Mr Abe described the country as ""an important partner"".  He said Japan and Vietam ""share the same challenge, with economies that can complement in each other"", but did not specifically refer to China, AP reports. Tensions between Tokyo and Beijing have been high since the territorial row over islands called Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China reignited last year.  Chinese government ships have been sailing in and out of what Japan says are its territorial waters around the islands, and in recent weeks Japanese fighters have been scrambled on a number of occasions after what Japan called an airspace violation by a Chinese government plane late last year.  Some Japanese businesses operating in China were also hit by fall-out from the row - last week Mr Abe criticised Beijing for allowing businesses to be damaged to achieve ""political objectives"".  The nations of the Asean regional bloc, meanwhile, have appeared divided in recent months over how to handle members' disputes over the South China Sea.  Japan's Asahi newspaper said in an editorial , externalthat it was vital for ""countries facing challenges posed by China's growing economic and military power to bolster their co-operation"". ""But there are differences among Asean members in their stances toward China. Any move that creates the perception that Japan is working with the United States to contain China's expansion could cause a rift among Asean countries,"" it said.  An editorial in China's People's Daily - the official mouthpiece of the Communist Party - said Japan has ""always slavishly imitated the US"" and that its frequent visits to Asean countries were ""to maintain unanimity with the US' 'return to Asia' strategy"".  ""Japan also hopes to win over Asean in order to keep pace together against China on the East China Sea and South China Sea issues and occupy a favourable position in terms of building a political and security structure in Asia-Pacific in future,"" it said. China's vocal state-run daily Global Times entitled ""Japan's hopes to contain China laughable, external"", meanwhile, said Mr Abe's visit would ""not bring China a sense of crisis"".  ""We can understand that Japan wants to strengthen its interests in South East Asia when the prospects of Sino-Japanese relations look bleak,"" it said.  But China was the driving force of geopolitical change in Asia, it went on. ""Japan's negotiations with claimants in South China Sea disputes will have no effect.""  Abe: China's row handling 'wrong' Has Chinese power driven Asean nations apart? What is the South China Sea dispute? How uninhabited islands soured China-Japan ties"
geopolitical tensions,The PowerPoint that sparked an international row,2024-09-15,2020-09-27,By Gordon Corera,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-54270739,"When Meng Wanzhou's flight landed in Vancouver on 1 December 2018, she was expecting to make only a brief stopover. But after almost a three-year prolonged stay, the chief financial officer of Huawei and daughter of the telecoms giant's founder is now a free woman.  On Friday, prosecutors announced that a request to extradite her to the US had been dropped.  During the three years of intense legal battles, Canada was caught in the escalating tension between Washington and Beijing.  At the centre of the story is a sixteen-page corporate PowerPoint presentation.  When her plane from Hong Kong landed, Meng Wanzhou planned to go to a house she owned in the Canadian city to collect some luggage before catching another flight to Mexico for a corporate meeting.   But instead she was questioned by Canadian border security agents for three hours as her phone was seized and luggage searched.  When that was over, she was formally admitted into Canada. It was at this point that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police moved in and arrested her because of an extradition request filed by the US. The US wanted Ms Meng to stand trial on charges including fraud linked to the alleged violation of US sanctions against Iran, allegations she denies.  The PowerPoint was used by Ms Meng at a meeting with the bank HSBC on 22 August 2013, and is seen as key evidence against her. Reuters news reports in the preceding months had raised questions about whether there had been a breach of trade sanctions on Iran by Hong Kong-based firm Skycom.  At issue was whether Skycom, a telecoms equipment seller, was simply a business partner of Huawei's - or a front for it to conceal its activities in Iran.  The US alleged that in the meeting - the one with the PowerPoint presentation - Ms Meng misled HSBC over the true nature of Huawei's relationship with Skycom and this, in turn, put the bank at risk of violating sanctions against Iran.  Her lawyers said the US misled the court, in particular about the PowerPoint, by omitting key information on two slides which showed HSBC was not, in fact, being kept in the dark about the true nature of the Skycom/Huawei relationship. Ms Meng's lawyers launched a multi-pronged attack on the US extradition request itself.  An initial attempt to claim that the crime for which she is charged in the US is not a crime in Canada failed (although that can be appealed).  Another challenge centred on politics around the case.  Her lawyers claimed that comments made by US President Donald Trump, which indicated a willingness to use the case as a bargaining chip in trade negotiations with China, constituted an abuse of process.  Another challenge related to her treatment at the airport in Vancouver. Her lawyers argued there was an abuse of process in the way she was treated.  They fought to have certain documents disclosed, including from the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, and sought to uncover what role US officials might have played in her arrest at the time.  A judge turned down requests for some documents.  It was thought that the case could take between five and 10 years to come to a conclusion.  Last month, Ms Meng appeared in court as a judge heard the final arguments about whether to send her to the US. Her case was also raised in high-level discussions between senior US and Chinese diplomats.  Huawei executives were also in touch with the US government to try and secure her release.  And then on Friday, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) announced it had reached a deferred prosecution agreement. This means that the DOJ will hold off from prosecuting Ms Meng until late next year and if she complies with conditions set by the court, the case will eventually be dropped.  Within hours, she had left Vancouver on a plane bound for China. The impact of the case has rippled far and wide.  The arrest of such a high-profile business figure led to anger in China. The country's ambassador said Canada had been ""taken advantage of"" and made an ""accomplice"" by America as Washington carried out a ""barbaric act of bullying"".  HSBC was put in a difficult position with Chinese media questioning how far the bank co-operated with the US in building the case they described as a politically driven trap.  The bank, already caught between the West and China over its stance on Hong Kong, maintained it only did what it was legally required to do and that there was no entrapment. The case has also raised broader questions over which countries might arrest business executives if they were to receive requests from the US.  It has led to concern that Western businesspeople and other travellers could find themselves detained by China to be used as bargaining chips. Two Canadians were detained days after Ms Meng's arrest. Michael Kovrig, a former diplomat, and Michael Spavor, a businessman, were later charged with spying. China has denied any link but the pair's detention was widely interpreted as a direct response to Ms Meng's arrest.  Last month, a Chinese court sentenced Spavor to 11 years in prison.  Then hours after a Canadian judge ended extradition proceedings against Meng, it was revealed that China had released the two men and they were flying home."
geopolitical tensions,Can the US live in Xi Jinping's world?,2024-09-15,2022-11-03,By John Sudworth,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-63386954,"Ten days ago Xi Jinping walked out in front of the world's media - depleted somewhat by his government's growing intolerance of foreign reporters - as the most powerful Chinese leader in decades.  A tradition that limited his recent predecessors to two terms had been broken. And third term in hand, he had cemented his power over China, perhaps indefinitely.  But even as Mr Xi's grip tightens at home, on the international stage the situation has rarely looked more unsettled. The more the Communist Party leader has reinforced China's authoritarian model, the more he has challenged a defining assumption of our age of globalisation - as China got richer, it would become freer.  That assumption drove decades of trade and engagement between Washington and Beijing.  It was the bedrock for an economic partnership that would eventually see more than half a trillion dollars' worth of goods cross the Pacific Ocean every year.  Now as Mr Xi begins his third term, he faces an ongoing trade war with the US and a fresh attempt to deny China access to high-end American chip-making technology that, according to some commentators, is designed to slow China's rise ""at any price"".    Beijing argues that the recent, marked chill in relations is being driven by America's desire to maintain its position as the pre-eminent world power.  President Joe Biden's newly released National Security Strategy defines Beijing as a bigger threat to the existing world order than Moscow. And Washington has begun to talk about a Chinese invasion of democratic Taiwan as an increasingly realistic prospect rather than a distant possibility.  This is a long way from the days when both US and Chinese leaders would declare that mutual enrichment would eventually outweigh ideological differences and tensions between an established superpower and a rising one.  So how did we get here?  'Habits of liberty' It's no small irony that it is President Joe Biden who is increasingly treating China as an adversary. And his attempt to cut off its access to advanced semiconductors is arguably the most significant reversal of the trade and engagement approach. In the late 1990s, Mr Biden, then a member of the US Senate, was a key architect of the efforts to welcome China into the World Trade Organization (WTO).  ""China is not our enemy,"" he told reporters on a trip to Shanghai in 2000 - a statement based on the belief that increased trade would lock China into a system of shared norms and universal values, and help its rise as a responsible power.  WTO membership - which became a reality on President George W Bush's watch - was the crowning glory of a decades-old policy of growing engagement, supported by every president since Richard Nixon.  Corporate America too had been lobbying hard for China to open up further, with the likes of British American Tobacco keen to sell to Chinese consumers, and the US-China Business Council eager for access to a cheap, compliant labour force.  For American unions worried about blue-collar job losses, and for anyone concerned about human rights, China's WTO membership was justified on ideological grounds.  Mr Bush, then the governor of Texas, perhaps put it best in a speech to Boeing workers on the presidential campaign trail in May 2000.  ""The case for trade,"" with China, he said, was ""not just a matter of commerce, but a matter of conviction"". ""Economic freedom creates habits of liberty. And habits of liberty create expectations of democracy.""  For a while, China's growing prosperity really did seem to raise the prospect of at least some limited, political reform. In the years following WTO membership, the internet - like elsewhere in the world - gave Chinese people an opportunity for discussion and dissent previously undreamt of.  Bill Clinton famously suggested that for the Communist Party taming the internet would be like ""trying to nail Jell-O [jelly] to the wall"".  Even after Mr Xi began his first term as the party's general secretary in 2012, international media coverage often focused on the skyscraper-studded skylines, the cultural exchanges and the new middle class as evidence that China was changing in fundamental ways, and for the better.  But there were plenty of clues that, early on in his rule, Mr Xi had identified those fledgling ""habits of liberty"" not as a welcome consequence of globalisation, but as something to be fought against at all costs.  Document Number 9, reportedly issued by the Communist Party's central office just a few months into his first term, lists seven perils to be guarded against, including ""universal values"", the concept of a ""civil society"" beyond party control, and a free press.  Mr Xi believed that it was ideological weakness and a failure to hold the socialist line that led to the downfall of the Soviet Union.  The ideal of shared, universal values was for him a Trojan Horse that would lead the Chinese Communist Party to go the same way, and his answer was swift and uncompromising - an unashamed reassertion of authoritarianism and one-party rule.  By the time of his second term, China had begun firmly nailing the Jell-O to the wall, imprisoning lawyers, muzzling dissent, snuffing out Hong Kong's freedoms and building camps for the mass incarceration of more than a million Uyghurs in its far western region of Xinjiang.  Yet there's little evidence that Western governments were in a hurry to ditch their support for trade and engagement, let alone switch to a policy of actively curtailing China's rise, as Beijing now claims. For decades, China's WTO entry offered huge profits for corporations that lined their supply chains with Chinese labour, and a new frontier for businesses to sell to Chinese consumers. Embassies have long been staffed - and many still are - with trade teams numbering in the hundreds.  The UK's so-called ""Golden Era"" with China - a tub-thumping endorsement of the trade and engagement mantra - was launched during Mr Xi's first term and continued into his second.  It even saw a UK chancellor travel to Xinjiang, by then already the focus of serious human rights concerns, for a photo opportunity specifically to highlight the trade opportunities on offer in the region.   I watched George Osborne, wearing a hi-viz vest, unloading a lorry a short drive away from the prison in which the prominent Uyghur intellectual Ilham Tohti had recently begun his life sentence.  While visiting politicians from democratic states have always trumpeted the benefits of engagement, human rights were more often raised ""behind closed doors"".  During the same period, Hunter Biden - the youngest son of the president - forged business relationships with Chinese entities with ties to the Communist Party, a connection that is at the centre of the political controversy swirling around him till today.  With hindsight, there's little evidence that American or European political elites were eager to re-evaluate the engagement approach.  During my time in Beijing, corporate executives would often tell me that my journalism covering China's growing repression somehow missed the point by not capturing the bigger picture of growing prosperity.  It was as if, instead of opening the minds of Chinese officials to the idea of political reform as promised, trade and engagement had instead changed the minds of those in the outside world, gazing in at the skyscrapers and high-speed rail links.  The lesson seemed to be not that economic freedoms and political freedoms went hand in hand, but that you could have all of this wealth without any human rights at all.  One senior manager for a US multinational household-products brand with large investments in China told me that ""Chinese people don't want freedom"" in the way people in the West do.   He'd spoken to workers in his factories, he insisted, and he'd concluded they had no interest in politics at all. ""They're happier earning money,"" he said.  Somewhere along the way many of the traders and engagers - corporations and governments alike - seemed to have simply dropped the lofty promise of bringing political freedom to China.  Increasing prosperity now seemed to be enough on its own.  So, what changed?  Firstly, public opinion. From 2018 onwards, the Uyghur diaspora began to speak out about the disappearance of their family members into Xinjiang's giant prison camps, despite the clear risk that doing so might bring further costs and punishments for those relatives back home.  China at first seemed shocked by the international reaction.   After all, Western governments had long tolerated many facets of Beijing's repression while continuing to trade and engage.  Even before Mr Xi took office, the targeting of religious belief, the jailing of dissidents and the brutal enforcement of the one-child policy were an integral part of the political system, not a mere side effect.  But the mass incarceration of the Uyghurs - with an entire people designated a threat solely on the basis of their culture and identity - had a big impact on global public opinion because of its historic resonances in Europe and beyond. Corporations with supply chains in Xinjiang were facing the mounting concern of consumers, and governments were coming under increasing political pressure to act.  There were other issues too - including the swiftness with which Beijing has crushed dissent in Hong Kong, its militarisation of the South China Sea and the growing threats over Taiwan.  But Xinjiang seemed to crystallise thinking and China too could feel the tide turning - it is no accident that many of the international journalists trying to uncover what was happening in Xinjiang have since been forced out of the country, myself included.  The latest Pew opinion survey finds that 80% of Americans now have an unfavourable opinion of China, up from just 40% or so a decade ago.  The second significant factor that changed things was Donald Trump.  Donald Trump's anti-China message may have been characteristically erratic - with his allegations of unfair trade practices tempered by his open admiration of Mr Xi's strongman-style - but he used it to rally a disaffected blue-collar base with great effect.   In short, he claimed that trade and engagement had been a bad bet with little to show for it, other than outsourced jobs and technology.   His opponents criticised his counter-productive methods and what they saw as his xenophobic language, but the mould had been broken.  President Biden has walked back few, if any, of Mr Trump's policies on China, including the trade war he launched. The tariffs have stayed.  Washington has come to belatedly realise that, far from speeding up political reform in China, trade and technology transfer has been used instead to bolster Beijing's authoritarian model.  There is no clearer indication of just how profound a shift has taken place in US-China relations than President Biden's recent comments on the status of Taiwan.  Last month he was asked by CBS News if US forces would be sent to defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion.  ""Yes,"" he said, ""if in fact there was an unprecedented attack.""   The official policy in Washington has long been one of deliberate strategic ambiguity over whether it would come to Taiwan's aid. Admitting that the US wouldn't intervene, the argument went, might give the green light to an invasion. And saying it would mount a defence might encourage Taiwan's self-ruled government towards a formal declaration of independence.  The new, apparent ""strategic clarity"" has been met with fury from Beijing, which sees it as a major readjustment in the US position.  It's hard to disagree, despite attempts by senior US officials to walk back the comments.  Instead of shared norms and values, China now offers its model of prosperous authoritarianism as a superior alternative.  It is working hard in international bodies, through its intelligence services, and its vast propaganda outreach to promote its system, while arguing that democracies are in decline.  In some quarters - the German business community for example - the argument in favour of trade and engagement has taken on an altogether different tone.  China is now so important to global supply chains, and so powerful, the new case being made is that we have no choice but to continue trading, for fear of harming our own economic interests or provoking a ""backlash"" from Beijing.  But in Washington, the view that China presents a serious threat has become one of the few topics of strong bipartisan consensus.   There may, as yet, be no easy alternatives - supply chains would take years to relocate and doing so will be expensive.  And China does have the means to reward those who continue to engage while imposing costs on those who don't.  But what is undoubtedly true at the start of Mr Xi's third term is that the world is in a moment of profound change.  And in China, as in Russia, America finds itself confronted by an adversary largely of its own making."
geopolitical tensions,HSBC foils plan by major investor to break up bank,2024-09-15,2023-05-05,By Nick Marsh,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-65478826,"HSBC has fought off an attempt by its biggest shareholder to break up the bank during a frequently tense annual general meeting. Chinese insurer Ping An has been trying for more than a year to split the bank. On Friday it failed to gain the backing of any other major shareholder as investors voted to reject the proposal. HSBC chairman Mark Tucker said the result ""draws a line"" under a long-running debate about the bank's structure. Despite being headquartered in London, the large majority of HSBC's profits are made in Asia.  Ping An, which holds an 8% stake in HSBC, wants the lender to separate out its Asian business.  It argues that the bank's profitable Asia operations are subsidising other parts of the bank that are not performing as strongly. Splitting HSBC would also set it free from the requirements of UK regulators.  Ping An and Ken Lui, an individual Hong Kong-based shareholder in HSBC, needed to secure 75% of all votes cast at the AGM to force through the split. They failed to get those numbers, with no other major institutional investor backing the plan.  Mr Tucker told the AGM a break-up of the bank would undermine its global strategy, and would be both risky and costly.  ""It would not be in shareholders' interests to split the bank,"" he told the AGM in Birmingham, which was frequently interrupted by climate change activists who claim HSBC is not doing enough to reduce its financing of polluting industries and businesses. At the meeting, Mr Lui vowed to fight on with the break-up plan, saying he would keep pressure on HSBC's management and would lobby the bank's many small shareholders in Hong Kong.  It is not clear what Ping An's next step will be but there are bigger factors at play beyond making a return on its investment. Ping An is partly owned by the Chinese state and, according to some analysts, could be representing Beijing's political aims as much as its shareholders' financial interests. Hong Kong is by far China's most important financial hub and HSBC is the centrepiece institution. Some argue that to Beijing, the idea of simply leaving the city's most valuable asset in Western hands could be a risk that is too big to take. The example of Russia's economic isolation following the invasion of Ukraine is a case in point. Should a similar geopolitical crisis emerge involving China - not an impossibility given the tensions around Taiwan and the South China Sea - having a grip on one of Asia's top banks will be vital. In this sense, HSBC is dealing with an existential crisis that dates back to its founding in Hong Kong under British rule. For most of its 158-year history, the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation - as it was originally known - has had a long-distance relationship with the UK. In fact, HSBC only became a major UK High Street player in the 1990s, when it bought Midland Bank and moved its headquarters to London in 1993. To this day, HSBC even prints the bank notes in Hong Kong. ""There is a jarring gap between HSBC's centre of gravity in Hong Kong and its subservience to regulators in Britain,"" says Steve Vickers, a corporate risk consultant based in Hong Kong. ""This is an accident of history and a remnant of the colonial era."" A small taste of this came in 2020, when the Bank of England directed HSBC and other British lenders to stop paying out dividends to shareholders because of the pandemic.  This enraged ordinary shareholders in Hong Kong, who own about a third of HSBC's shares and many of whom rely on the payments for their retirement funds.  From the Chinese mainland perspective, it was a simple but stark illustration of the power of officials on the other side of the world. Asia may generate the money, but ultimately London calls the shots. This is not a situation either Ping An or China wants to be in. It may explain why Ping An is pushing HSBC so hard and so publicly with the kind of shareholder activism that is normally associated with Western investors. ""A more assertive China is now unafraid to project itself in the international business arena,"" says Steve Vickers. ""But they have to tread very carefully with HSBC - the stakes are high."""
geopolitical tensions,India sees opportunity in anti-China backlash,2024-09-15,2020-05-18,By Nikhil Inamdar,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-52672510,"With Covid-19 infecting millions across the world, China is facing an unprecedented global backlash that could destabilise its reign as the world's factory of choice. Its neighbour India has sensed an opportunity and is keen to make inroads to a space it hopes China will vacate sooner rather than later.  China's weakened global position is a ""blessing in disguise"" for India to attract more investment, transport minister Nitin Gadkari said in a recent interview. The northern state of Uttar Pradesh, which has a population the size of Brazil, is already forming an economic task force to attract firms keen to ditch China.  India is also readying a pool of land twice the size of Luxembourg to offer companies that want to move manufacturing out of China, and has reached out to 1,000 American multinationals, Bloomberg reported. ""This outreach has been an ongoing process,"" Deepak Bagla, chief executive of Invest India, the government's national investment promotion agency told the BBC. ""Covid will only accelerate the process of de-risking from China for many of these companies.""  The US-India Business Council (USIBC), a powerful lobby group that works to enhance investment flows between India and the US, also said that India has significantly stepped up its pitch.  ""We are seeing India prioritise efforts to attract supply chains, both at central and state government level,"" Nisha Biswal, President of USIBC and the former assistant secretary of state for south and central Asian affairs in the US Department of State, told the BBC.   ""Companies that already have some manufacturing in India may be earlier movers in reducing output in plants in China and scaling up in production in India.""  But things are still at an evaluation stage and decisions are unlikely to be made in a hurry, she added.  In an environment where global balance sheets are fractured, relocating entire supply chains is easier said than done.  ""Many of these companies are facing severe cash and capital constraints because of the pandemic, and will therefore be very cautious before making quick moves,"" independent economist Rupa Subramanya said.  According to Rahul Jacob, a long-time China watcher and former Financial Times bureau chief in Hong Kong, the Indian government putting together land banks is a step in the right direction, but large companies are unlikely to move their operations just because land is made available.  ""Production lines and supply chains are far more sticky than most people seem to understand. It is very difficult to pull them apart overnight,"" he said. ""China offers integrated infrastructure like large ports and highways, top quality labour and sophisticated logistics, all of which are critical factors to meet strict deadlines that international companies operate on."" Another reason India might not be the obvious choice for global multinationals is because it isn't well integrated with major global supply chains.  Last year Delhi pulled out of a crucial multilateral trade agreement with 12 other Asian countries, collectively known as the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), despite seven years of negotiations. Decisions like these make it difficult for Indian exporters to benefit from tariff-free access to destination markets or offer reciprocity to its trading partners.  ""Why would I make something that I want to sell to Singapore in India? Being connected in trade agreements institutionally is as important as offering competitive prices,"" Parag Khanna, author of The Future is Asian, told the BBC.  Regional integration is particularly crucial he believes, as global trade begins to follow the ""sell where you make"" model where companies so-called ""near-source"" rather than out-source production and bring it closer to demand.  India's volatile relationship with foreign direct investment (FDI) and uneven regulation is also something that continues to bother global companies. From prohibiting e-commerce companies to sell non-essential items and tweaking FDI rules to disallow easier capital flows from neighbouring countries, the fear is that India has used the pandemic to build protectionist walls around itself.  In a recent address to the nation, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi made ""be vocal for local"" his rallying cry. New stimulus proposals meanwhile have increased thresholds for foreign companies bidding for Indian contracts.  ""The more that India can improve regulatory stability, the better its chances of persuading more global businesses to establish hubs in India,"" says Mr Biswal. So then who, If not India?  As things stand, Vietnam, Bangladesh, South Korea and Taiwan seem to be favourites to benefit from the backlash against China. The latter two at the ""high-tech end of the spectrum"" and Vietnam and Bangladesh at the lower end, according to Mr Jacob.  Multinationals began moving production out of China into these countries nearly a decade ago due to rising labour and environmental costs. The slow exodus has only gathered pace as US-China trade tensions have increased in recent years.  Since June 2018, a month before the trade war began, US goods imports from Vietnam have soared by more than 50% and those from Taiwan by 30%, according to calculations made by the South China Morning Post newspaper. India is seen to have lost out because it failed to create conditions allowing multinationals to supply not only the local market, but also to use the country as a production base to export to the world.  In recent weeks, several states have begun making moves to address some concerns around the ease of doing business - prime among them being making contentious changes to India's archaic labour laws, put in place to reduce exploitation. Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh states, for instance, have suspended significant labour protections exempting factories from even maintaining basic requirements like cleanliness, ventilation, lighting and toilets.  The intention is to improve the investment climate and attract global capital.  But such decisions could become counterproductive and hurt rather than help, says Mr Jacob: ""International companies would be very wary about this. They have strict codes of conduct on labour, environment and safety standards for suppliers.""  The 2013 collapse of the Rana Plaza garment factory in Bangladesh that supplied retailers like Walmart was a turning point. It forced Bangladesh to significantly improve factory infrastructure and safety to clinch more investment, he cautions.  ""India has to follow better standards. These are white board ideas drafted on Powerpoint by bureaucrats who are completely divorced from the reality of global trade.""  But with the US weighing punitive action against China, Japan paying its corporations to move out of the country and UK lawmakers coming under pressure to reconsider their decision to allow Chinese telecoms giant Huawei a role in building the country's new 5G data network, global anti-China sentiment is increasing.  The time is ripe, say experts, for India to undertake broad-based structural reforms and use these sweeping geopolitical shifts to modify its trading relationship with the world. "
geopolitical tensions,Migrant caravan heads to US as key summit begins,2024-09-15,2022-06-07,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-61685118,"Thousands of migrants are headed to the US-Mexican border in a caravan timed to coincide with a meeting of Western Hemisphere leaders in Los Angeles.  Some 6,000 people, including many from Venezuela and Central America, have begun walking from the southern tip of Mexico north as part of a caravan.  Migration is among the top issues on the agenda at the Summit of the Americas.  The caravan may be one of the largest in recent years.  On Monday, the group began its 1,270 mile (2,000 km) journey to the US from the Mexican city of Tapachula, near the country's border with Guatemala. It is unclear when they will arrive at the northern frontier. The group's organisers say it is made up of people who are fleeing instability, violence and poverty in their home countries.  Robinson Reyes, 35, a Colombian migrant, said he was traveling north after waiting in vain in Mexico for a month for a humanitarian visa.  ""We want a future for our family,"" he told Reuters. ""We are not violent. We just want a better future.""  Mr Reyes added that the caravan timed its departure to coincide with the Summit of the Americas in Los Angeles, where regional leaders are expected to announce new plans to address mass migration from Latin America.  ""That's why we went out today,"" he said. ""God willing, they can talk and resolve this"".  Efforts to address migration at the summit are likely to be complicated by geopolitical tensions, however.  Earlier this week, Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said he would not attend after the White House announced that Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua - all significant source countries for migrants - would be excluded from the summit. A senior administration official cited a ""lack of democratic space"" and deteriorating human rights situations in all three countries as the reason for their exclusion.  On Friday, US President Joe Biden is scheduled to hold a meeting with regional leaders to sign a declaration aimed at addressing migration.  A senior official told reporters on Monday that Mr Biden would also discuss a ""bold"" new plan aimed at ""responsibility sharing and economic support for countries that have been most impacted by refugees and migration"".  The official added that Mexico is still expected to sign despite Mr López Obrador's absence.  ""We believe in every way they are fully committed to it,"" the official said. "
geopolitical tensions,World's biggest luxury firm reports record profits,2024-09-15,2023-01-27,By Monica Miller,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-64408724,"The world's biggest luxury group has reported strong sales driven by the holiday shopping season.  LVMH said they experienced a second straight record year with revenue and profits despite geopolitical tensions and high cost of living. Sales reached almost $25bn (£19.9), a 9% increase in the final three months of the year.  The company saw strong growth in Europe, US and Japan which made up for losses in China due to Covid lockdowns.  In Asia, LVMH did experience a 20% drop in growth in the first nine months as the world's second largest economy doubled down on its zero-Covid policy.   However, LVMH chairman and chief executive Bernard Arnault said he felt cautiously optimistic about ""green shoots"" in China.   ""We have every reason to be confident, indeed optimistic about China,"" Mr Arnault said at the group's earnings presentation.   He pointed to their Macau stores as a sign of what could come. ""Business is back, the Chinese are buying,"" he said.  LVMH brands include Tiffany's, Christian Dior, Sephora, Hennessey and Moët.  Its designer label Louis Vuitton did exceptionally well. Its revenue surpassed $21.7bn for the first time. The label recently launched a new collaboration with Japanese contemporary artist Yayoi Kusama, who is known for her art made of colourful dots.  LVMH's earnings are viewed by analysts as a bellwether in the luxury market. Bain and Company said they see a boost in spending on personal luxury goods overall.  ""The personal luxury market is projected to see further growth of at least 3-8% next year, even given a downturn in global economic conditions,"" according to a report from the consulting company. Earlier this month, LVMH made changes to its leadership staff. Mr Arnault, one of the world's richest men, appointed his daughter as the head of the fashion house Dior. Delphine Arnault, 47, replaced Pietro Beccari - who took over as chief executive of Louis Vuitton. All five of Mr Arnault's children hold management positions at brands in the group."
geopolitical tensions,The pain of Gurkhas over Indian army's new hiring plan,2024-09-15,2023-08-27,By Anbarasan Ethirajan,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-66603133,"For decades, Nepal has allowed its ethnic Gurkha soldiers to join the Indian army under a special agreement. The practice came to an abrupt halt last year after India introduced a controversial new army hiring plan, straining ties between the two neighbouring countries.  The Gurkhas, famed for their ferocity and bravery, have fought several wars over the decades for both the Indian and British armies.  They were first recruited by the British East India company in 1815 following a peace deal with Nepal.   After the end of colonial rule in 1947 a tripartite agreement between Nepal, India and Britain allowed Delhi and London to continue to recruit Gurkhas to their military.  But the arrangement with Delhi came to a halt last year after the Indian government announced Agnipath, a new hiring scheme for its soldiers.  Agnipath, or Path of Fire, hires soldiers on a fixed four-year term. Only a top performing 25% will be retained for India's central security forces. The rest will be allowed to leave with a lumpsum amount of nearly $15,000 (£11,915) without pension or any other career benefits. The rules also apply to the Gurkha soldiers who have historically served for much longer terms in both the Indian and British armies.  Nepali officials say they were taken aback by Delhi's abrupt decision, as they were neither informed nor consulted on such a crucial change to the military recruitment programme.  ""We have a policy that if there is any change made to a tripartite treaty, then it should be implemented through a political consensus,"" Nepalese Foreign Minister NP Saud told the BBC, adding that the recruitment of Gurkhas would be postponed for now.  With most Nepalese political parties stoutly opposed to the change, it has become even more difficult for the current government to reach a consensus.  ""We are not going to accept the new plan. If India is ready to revert back to the older Gurkha recruitment process, then it can be resumed,"" Pradeep Kumar Gyawali, a senior leader of the main opposition Communist Party of Nepal (UML) told the BBC. Prior to the new scheme, India on average recruited about 1,400 Nepali citizens into its Gurkha regiments every year.  There are about 35,000 Nepali Gurkhas currently serving in the Indian army, including in the geopolitically sensitive region of Indian-administered Kashmir and the northeastern parts of the country.  Delhi argues that the new hiring plan will reduce its army expenditure on ballooning salaries and pensions, which consume more than half of its defence budget. The short-term contracts will also lower the average age of its 1.3 million-strong armed forces.  For Nepal, this raises fears of a heightened risk from insurgents. ""There is a danger that a person with four years of military combat training can be recruited by any insurgent group in the country or even by foreign mercenaries,"" said Prem Singh Basnyat, a Nepalese military historian and a retired army officer.  Nepal suffered heavily due to a decade-long armed rebellion by Maoists that ended in 2006. Thousands of people were killed during the unrest. The country says it is not in a position to offer employment to all those who return from India.  There have been calls in India as well to exempt the Nepali Gurkhas from the short-term contracts.  Maj Gen (Retd) Ashok Mehta, who served in the Indian Gurkha regiment, says the Agnipath scheme could complicate Delhi's ties with Kathmandu. ""The Indian government abrogated its responsibility in following diplomatic niceties, especially with a country like Nepal with which it claims special and unique relationship,"" he said.  Indian officials have hinted that if Gurkhas from Nepal do not take up short-term contracts, then the jobs could be distributed to others in India for the time being.  The BBC has reached out to India's foreign ministry for comment. Experts say the move could further alienate Kathmandu, which already feels aggrieved by recent Indian actions.  Nepal was furious in 2019 when India published a map, including some of the areas claimed by Kathmandu in the western region, close to the border with China.  The diplomatic wrangle escalated after Nepal also published its own map including those disputed areas. A few years before the map controversy, the ethnic Madhesi community in Nepal had blocked goods traffic from India as part of its 2015 protests for more rights. Though India denied it was behind the economic blockade, very few people in Nepal believed the denial. In a playground outside Kathmandu, an instructor was making dozens of young men go through their paces as part of a training programme for the forthcoming Gurkha recruitment to the British army.  Some of them, like Aneesh Thapa Magar, 19, were hoping to join the Indian military - as many of his relatives did. ""The Agnipath programme is of no use to us. After four years, we will return home without knowing what to do next. That's why I am now practising hard to get selected for the British army,"" Mr Magar says. The Gurkhas have a strong bond with the Indian military, and Gurkha regiments have become part of the culture of the Nepali hill communities.   There are about 120,000 Indian Gurkha veterans living in Nepal. Their pension and other benefits have contributed to the economy of the impoverished hill regions. Despite the stiff opposition, not everyone is resistant to the new hiring scheme. Nepalese Indian Gurkha veterans like Laxmikant Pandey argue that the Agnipath scheme has its advantages and should not be rejected outright.  ""The scheme offers a lumpsum amount at the end of the tenure and the Indian military experience will open up many other opportunities in Nepal and abroad,"" he said. The best option, he suggests, is to open up a dialogue with Delhi to get more concessions. In the meantime, the first batch of Indian soldiers who signed up for the Agnipath scheme have joined the army, after completing their training courses in the first week of August.

geopolitical tensions,Can the US live in Xi Jinping's world?,2024-09-15,2022-11-03,By John Sudworth,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-63386954,"Ten days ago Xi Jinping walked out in front of the world's media - depleted somewhat by his government's growing intolerance of foreign reporters - as the most powerful Chinese leader in decades.  A tradition that limited his recent predecessors to two terms had been broken. And third term in hand, he had cemented his power over China, perhaps indefinitely.  But even as Mr Xi's grip tightens at home, on the international stage the situation has rarely looked more unsettled. The more the Communist Party leader has reinforced China's authoritarian model, the more he has challenged a defining assumption of our age of globalisation - as China got richer, it would become freer.  That assumption drove decades of trade and engagement between Washington and Beijing.  It was the bedrock for an economic partnership that would eventually see more than half a trillion dollars' worth of goods cross the Pacific Ocean every year.  Now as Mr Xi begins his third term, he faces an ongoing trade war with the US and a fresh attempt to deny China access to high-end American chip-making technology that, according to some commentators, is designed to slow China's rise ""at any price"".    Beijing argues that the recent, marked chill in relations is being driven by America's desire to maintain its position as the pre-eminent world power.  President Joe Biden's newly released National Security Strategy defines Beijing as a bigger threat to the existing world order than Moscow. And Washington has begun to talk about a Chinese invasion of democratic Taiwan as an increasingly realistic prospect rather than a distant possibility.  This is a long way from the days when both US and Chinese leaders would declare that mutual enrichment would eventually outweigh ideological differences and tensions between an established superpower and a rising one.  So how did we get here?  'Habits of liberty' It's no small irony that it is President Joe Biden who is increasingly treating China as an adversary. And his attempt to cut off its access to advanced semiconductors is arguably the most significant reversal of the trade and engagement approach. In the late 1990s, Mr Biden, then a member of the US Senate, was a key architect of the efforts to welcome China into the World Trade Organization (WTO).  ""China is not our enemy,"" he told reporters on a trip to Shanghai in 2000 - a statement based on the belief that increased trade would lock China into a system of shared norms and universal values, and help its rise as a responsible power.  WTO membership - which became a reality on President George W Bush's watch - was the crowning glory of a decades-old policy of growing engagement, supported by every president since Richard Nixon.  Corporate America too had been lobbying hard for China to open up further, with the likes of British American Tobacco keen to sell to Chinese consumers, and the US-China Business Council eager for access to a cheap, compliant labour force.  For American unions worried about blue-collar job losses, and for anyone concerned about human rights, China's WTO membership was justified on ideological grounds.  Mr Bush, then the governor of Texas, perhaps put it best in a speech to Boeing workers on the presidential campaign trail in May 2000.  ""The case for trade,"" with China, he said, was ""not just a matter of commerce, but a matter of conviction"". ""Economic freedom creates habits of liberty. And habits of liberty create expectations of democracy.""  For a while, China's growing prosperity really did seem to raise the prospect of at least some limited, political reform. In the years following WTO membership, the internet - like elsewhere in the world - gave Chinese people an opportunity for discussion and dissent previously undreamt of.  Bill Clinton famously suggested that for the Communist Party taming the internet would be like ""trying to nail Jell-O [jelly] to the wall"".  Even after Mr Xi began his first term as the party's general secretary in 2012, international media coverage often focused on the skyscraper-studded skylines, the cultural exchanges and the new middle class as evidence that China was changing in fundamental ways, and for the better.  But there were plenty of clues that, early on in his rule, Mr Xi had identified those fledgling ""habits of liberty"" not as a welcome consequence of globalisation, but as something to be fought against at all costs.  Document Number 9, reportedly issued by the Communist Party's central office just a few months into his first term, lists seven perils to be guarded against, including ""universal values"", the concept of a ""civil society"" beyond party control, and a free press.  Mr Xi believed that it was ideological weakness and a failure to hold the socialist line that led to the downfall of the Soviet Union.  The ideal of shared, universal values was for him a Trojan Horse that would lead the Chinese Communist Party to go the same way, and his answer was swift and uncompromising - an unashamed reassertion of authoritarianism and one-party rule.  By the time of his second term, China had begun firmly nailing the Jell-O to the wall, imprisoning lawyers, muzzling dissent, snuffing out Hong Kong's freedoms and building camps for the mass incarceration of more than a million Uyghurs in its far western region of Xinjiang.  Yet there's little evidence that Western governments were in a hurry to ditch their support for trade and engagement, let alone switch to a policy of actively curtailing China's rise, as Beijing now claims. For decades, China's WTO entry offered huge profits for corporations that lined their supply chains with Chinese labour, and a new frontier for businesses to sell to Chinese consumers. Embassies have long been staffed - and many still are - with trade teams numbering in the hundreds.  The UK's so-called ""Golden Era"" with China - a tub-thumping endorsement of the trade and engagement mantra - was launched during Mr Xi's first term and continued into his second.  It even saw a UK chancellor travel to Xinjiang, by then already the focus of serious human rights concerns, for a photo opportunity specifically to highlight the trade opportunities on offer in the region.   I watched George Osborne, wearing a hi-viz vest, unloading a lorry a short drive away from the prison in which the prominent Uyghur intellectual Ilham Tohti had recently begun his life sentence.  While visiting politicians from democratic states have always trumpeted the benefits of engagement, human rights were more often raised ""behind closed doors"".  During the same period, Hunter Biden - the youngest son of the president - forged business relationships with Chinese entities with ties to the Communist Party, a connection that is at the centre of the political controversy swirling around him till today.  With hindsight, there's little evidence that American or European political elites were eager to re-evaluate the engagement approach.  During my time in Beijing, corporate executives would often tell me that my journalism covering China's growing repression somehow missed the point by not capturing the bigger picture of growing prosperity.  It was as if, instead of opening the minds of Chinese officials to the idea of political reform as promised, trade and engagement had instead changed the minds of those in the outside world, gazing in at the skyscrapers and high-speed rail links.  The lesson seemed to be not that economic freedoms and political freedoms went hand in hand, but that you could have all of this wealth without any human rights at all.  One senior manager for a US multinational household-products brand with large investments in China told me that ""Chinese people don't want freedom"" in the way people in the West do.   He'd spoken to workers in his factories, he insisted, and he'd concluded they had no interest in politics at all. ""They're happier earning money,"" he said.  Somewhere along the way many of the traders and engagers - corporations and governments alike - seemed to have simply dropped the lofty promise of bringing political freedom to China.  Increasing prosperity now seemed to be enough on its own.  So, what changed?  Firstly, public opinion. From 2018 onwards, the Uyghur diaspora began to speak out about the disappearance of their family members into Xinjiang's giant prison camps, despite the clear risk that doing so might bring further costs and punishments for those relatives back home.  China at first seemed shocked by the international reaction.   After all, Western governments had long tolerated many facets of Beijing's repression while continuing to trade and engage.  Even before Mr Xi took office, the targeting of religious belief, the jailing of dissidents and the brutal enforcement of the one-child policy were an integral part of the political system, not a mere side effect.  But the mass incarceration of the Uyghurs - with an entire people designated a threat solely on the basis of their culture and identity - had a big impact on global public opinion because of its historic resonances in Europe and beyond. Corporations with supply chains in Xinjiang were facing the mounting concern of consumers, and governments were coming under increasing political pressure to act.  There were other issues too - including the swiftness with which Beijing has crushed dissent in Hong Kong, its militarisation of the South China Sea and the growing threats over Taiwan.  But Xinjiang seemed to crystallise thinking and China too could feel the tide turning - it is no accident that many of the international journalists trying to uncover what was happening in Xinjiang have since been forced out of the country, myself included.  The latest Pew opinion survey finds that 80% of Americans now have an unfavourable opinion of China, up from just 40% or so a decade ago.  The second significant factor that changed things was Donald Trump.  Donald Trump's anti-China message may have been characteristically erratic - with his allegations of unfair trade practices tempered by his open admiration of Mr Xi's strongman-style - but he used it to rally a disaffected blue-collar base with great effect.   In short, he claimed that trade and engagement had been a bad bet with little to show for it, other than outsourced jobs and technology.   His opponents criticised his counter-productive methods and what they saw as his xenophobic language, but the mould had been broken.  President Biden has walked back few, if any, of Mr Trump's policies on China, including the trade war he launched. The tariffs have stayed.  Washington has come to belatedly realise that, far from speeding up political reform in China, trade and technology transfer has been used instead to bolster Beijing's authoritarian model.  There is no clearer indication of just how profound a shift has taken place in US-China relations than President Biden's recent comments on the status of Taiwan.  Last month he was asked by CBS News if US forces would be sent to defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion.  ""Yes,"" he said, ""if in fact there was an unprecedented attack.""   The official policy in Washington has long been one of deliberate strategic ambiguity over whether it would come to Taiwan's aid. Admitting that the US wouldn't intervene, the argument went, might give the green light to an invasion. And saying it would mount a defence might encourage Taiwan's self-ruled government towards a formal declaration of independence.  The new, apparent ""strategic clarity"" has been met with fury from Beijing, which sees it as a major readjustment in the US position.  It's hard to disagree, despite attempts by senior US officials to walk back the comments.  Instead of shared norms and values, China now offers its model of prosperous authoritarianism as a superior alternative.  It is working hard in international bodies, through its intelligence services, and its vast propaganda outreach to promote its system, while arguing that democracies are in decline.  In some quarters - the German business community for example - the argument in favour of trade and engagement has taken on an altogether different tone.  China is now so important to global supply chains, and so powerful, the new case being made is that we have no choice but to continue trading, for fear of harming our own economic interests or provoking a ""backlash"" from Beijing.  But in Washington, the view that China presents a serious threat has become one of the few topics of strong bipartisan consensus.   There may, as yet, be no easy alternatives - supply chains would take years to relocate and doing so will be expensive.  And China does have the means to reward those who continue to engage while imposing costs on those who don't.  But what is undoubtedly true at the start of Mr Xi's third term is that the world is in a moment of profound change.  And in China, as in Russia, America finds itself confronted by an adversary largely of its own making."
geopolitical tensions,HSBC foils plan by major investor to break up bank,2024-09-15,2023-05-05,By Nick Marsh,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-65478826,"HSBC has fought off an attempt by its biggest shareholder to break up the bank during a frequently tense annual general meeting. Chinese insurer Ping An has been trying for more than a year to split the bank. On Friday it failed to gain the backing of any other major shareholder as investors voted to reject the proposal. HSBC chairman Mark Tucker said the result ""draws a line"" under a long-running debate about the bank's structure. Despite being headquartered in London, the large majority of HSBC's profits are made in Asia.  Ping An, which holds an 8% stake in HSBC, wants the lender to separate out its Asian business.  It argues that the bank's profitable Asia operations are subsidising other parts of the bank that are not performing as strongly. Splitting HSBC would also set it free from the requirements of UK regulators.  Ping An and Ken Lui, an individual Hong Kong-based shareholder in HSBC, needed to secure 75% of all votes cast at the AGM to force through the split. They failed to get those numbers, with no other major institutional investor backing the plan.  Mr Tucker told the AGM a break-up of the bank would undermine its global strategy, and would be both risky and costly.  ""It would not be in shareholders' interests to split the bank,"" he told the AGM in Birmingham, which was frequently interrupted by climate change activists who claim HSBC is not doing enough to reduce its financing of polluting industries and businesses. At the meeting, Mr Lui vowed to fight on with the break-up plan, saying he would keep pressure on HSBC's management and would lobby the bank's many small shareholders in Hong Kong.  It is not clear what Ping An's next step will be but there are bigger factors at play beyond making a return on its investment. Ping An is partly owned by the Chinese state and, according to some analysts, could be representing Beijing's political aims as much as its shareholders' financial interests. Hong Kong is by far China's most important financial hub and HSBC is the centrepiece institution. Some argue that to Beijing, the idea of simply leaving the city's most valuable asset in Western hands could be a risk that is too big to take. The example of Russia's economic isolation following the invasion of Ukraine is a case in point. Should a similar geopolitical crisis emerge involving China - not an impossibility given the tensions around Taiwan and the South China Sea - having a grip on one of Asia's top banks will be vital. In this sense, HSBC is dealing with an existential crisis that dates back to its founding in Hong Kong under British rule. For most of its 158-year history, the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation - as it was originally known - has had a long-distance relationship with the UK. In fact, HSBC only became a major UK High Street player in the 1990s, when it bought Midland Bank and moved its headquarters to London in 1993. To this day, HSBC even prints the bank notes in Hong Kong. ""There is a jarring gap between HSBC's centre of gravity in Hong Kong and its subservience to regulators in Britain,"" says Steve Vickers, a corporate risk consultant based in Hong Kong. ""This is an accident of history and a remnant of the colonial era."" A small taste of this came in 2020, when the Bank of England directed HSBC and other British lenders to stop paying out dividends to shareholders because of the pandemic.  This enraged ordinary shareholders in Hong Kong, who own about a third of HSBC's shares and many of whom rely on the payments for their retirement funds.  From the Chinese mainland perspective, it was a simple but stark illustration of the power of officials on the other side of the world. Asia may generate the money, but ultimately London calls the shots. This is not a situation either Ping An or China wants to be in. It may explain why Ping An is pushing HSBC so hard and so publicly with the kind of shareholder activism that is normally associated with Western investors. ""A more assertive China is now unafraid to project itself in the international business arena,"" says Steve Vickers. ""But they have to tread very carefully with HSBC - the stakes are high."""
geopolitical tensions,Why Iran gave the US flowers in 1998 World Cup clash,2024-09-15,2022-11-29,By Bernd Debusmann Jr,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-63797316,"Amid harsh barbs and heated geopolitics, the last World Cup match-up between Iran and the United States began with an unlikely gesture - bouquets of white flowers.  The flowers, Iran's coach later said, were meant as a symbol of peace ahead of the 1998 showdown in France.  Two decades later, political tensions were again high ahead of the Iran-US game in Qatar.  The latest meeting, however, went without any friendly gestures.  The previous match, held in Lyon, came 20 years after diplomatic relations between the two nations were severed as a result of the storming of the US embassy in Tehran in 1979 and subsequent 444 day hostage crisis.  Just one month before kick-off, the US State Department labelled Iran the world's ""most active"" state sponsor of terrorism, while several high-level Iranian officials kept up a steady drumbeat of anti-US rhetoric.  Despite the tensions evident in the halls of the United Nations and in the Persian Gulf, Iran's players - led by California-based manager Jalal Talebi - decided to start the match with a signal that the only competition between the two would be on the pitch.  ""We decided to make something special,"" Mr Talebi said in an oral history of the match produced by ESPN.  ""Let us go inside and give them nice flowers to say that we are here for peace. We are not here for fighting or anything.""  The US team reciprocated, giving their opponents US Soccer Federation (USSF) pennants. Together, the squads posed for a group picture, with many of the players smiling ahead of the high-pressure match.  ""I thought that was great,"" Cobi Jones, then a midfielder for the US team, said in the ESPN report.  ""It's just like a sign of like sport trumping politics and all that. That was very important and having the mixed photo was great.""   The days leading up to the World Cup rematch on Tuesday between the two teams were once again marked by tensions, coming amid widespread anti-government protests in Iran and just after the USSF removed the emblem of the Islamic Republican from the flag it posted in online graphics.  The pictures were later deleted, and US manager Gregg Berhalter apologised, saying that ""sometimes things are out of our control"" and that he and the US team were only focused on football.  The US team went into the match hoping to avoid a repeat of the 1998 game, which ended with a 2-1 victory for Iran, though both countries were eliminated from the tournament after the game.  Alexi Lalas, a Fox Sports commentator who was a member of the 1998 team, told the Associated Press that the current US team would be well advised not to ignore the wider geopolitics surrounding the current match.  ""Understanding the importance of this game, not just from a soccer perspective but from a cultural perspective, I think is crucial for the United States,"" he said, addressing what would motivate the US on the pitch.  The US-Iran match in Qatar ended 1-0 in the Americans' favour after a goal from Christian Pulisic in the 38th minute. "
geopolitical tensions,UAE starts up Arab world's first nuclear plant,2024-09-15,2020-08-01,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-53619916,"The United Arab Emirates has launched operations at the Arab world's first nuclear power plant, on the Gulf coast just east of Qatar. Nuclear fission has begun in one of four reactors at the Barakah plant, which uses South Korean technology. The plant was due to open in 2017 but start-up was delayed for what officials said were safety requirements. The oil-rich UAE wants Barakah to meet a quarter of its energy needs, as it adopts more sustainable energy sources. Just two weeks ago the UAE sent a probe on a mission to Mars - another high-profile scientific first for the Gulf nation. The UAE is also investing heavily in solar power - a plentiful energy source in the Gulf. Some energy experts question the logic of Barakah, arguing that solar power is cleaner, cheaper and makes more sense in a region plagued by political tensions and terrorism. Last year Qatar called the Barakah plant a ""flagrant threat to regional peace and environment"". Qatar is a bitter regional rival of the UAE and Saudi Arabia. Across the Gulf lies Iran, hostile to the UAE, and subject to US sanctions because of its controversial nuclear programme. Dr Paul Dorfman, head of the international Nuclear Consulting Group, wrote last year that ""the tense geopolitical environment in the Gulf makes nuclear a more controversial issue in this region than elsewhere, as new nuclear power provides the capability to develop and make nuclear weapons"". The London-based scientist also highlighted the risk of radioactive pollution in the Gulf.  In a statement the plant's developer the Emirates Nuclear Energy Corporation (ENEC) said it was committed to the ""highest standards of safety and security"" and that the plant would play an important role diversifying and decarbonising the economy. ""The Barakah plant will supply clean baseload electricity to the grid - complementing intermittent renewable sources of energy such as solar and wind, which are not able to generate electricity on a continuous basis,"" it said.  ""It will provide up to 25% of the UAE's electricity needs once fully operational and will help prevent the release of 21 million tons of carbon emissions, equivalent to removing 3.2 millions cars off the road annually."" UAE leaders hailed the start-up on Saturday as a symbol of the country's scientific progress.  The Barakah plant was developed by ENEC and Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO). Energy will be generated by 1,400-megawatt pressurised water reactors, designed in South Korea, called APR-1400. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) - the nuclear industry's main oversight body - praised Barakah in a tweet, saying the plant's Unit 1 had ""achieved its first criticality"" - that is, generation of a controlled fission chain reaction. ""This is an important milestone towards commercial operations and generating clean energy. IAEA has been supporting [United Arab Emirates] from the beginning of its nuclear power programme."" The leader of Abu Dhabi, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, tweeted his congratulations ""marking this milestone in the roadmap for sustainable development"".

geopolitical tensions,World's biggest luxury firm reports record profits,2024-09-15,2023-01-27,By Monica Miller,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-64408724,"The world's biggest luxury group has reported strong sales driven by the holiday shopping season.  LVMH said they experienced a second straight record year with revenue and profits despite geopolitical tensions and high cost of living. Sales reached almost $25bn (£19.9), a 9% increase in the final three months of the year.  The company saw strong growth in Europe, US and Japan which made up for losses in China due to Covid lockdowns.  In Asia, LVMH did experience a 20% drop in growth in the first nine months as the world's second largest economy doubled down on its zero-Covid policy.   However, LVMH chairman and chief executive Bernard Arnault said he felt cautiously optimistic about ""green shoots"" in China.   ""We have every reason to be confident, indeed optimistic about China,"" Mr Arnault said at the group's earnings presentation.   He pointed to their Macau stores as a sign of what could come. ""Business is back, the Chinese are buying,"" he said.  LVMH brands include Tiffany's, Christian Dior, Sephora, Hennessey and Moët.  Its designer label Louis Vuitton did exceptionally well. Its revenue surpassed $21.7bn for the first time. The label recently launched a new collaboration with Japanese contemporary artist Yayoi Kusama, who is known for her art made of colourful dots.  LVMH's earnings are viewed by analysts as a bellwether in the luxury market. Bain and Company said they see a boost in spending on personal luxury goods overall.  ""The personal luxury market is projected to see further growth of at least 3-8% next year, even given a downturn in global economic conditions,"" according to a report from the consulting company. Earlier this month, LVMH made changes to its leadership staff. Mr Arnault, one of the world's richest men, appointed his daughter as the head of the fashion house Dior. Delphine Arnault, 47, replaced Pietro Beccari - who took over as chief executive of Louis Vuitton. All five of Mr Arnault's children hold management positions at brands in the group."
geopolitical tensions,Ukraine wooed by rival suitors,2024-09-15,2013-11-26,Steve Rosenberg,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-25095672,"This video can not be played The opera is Italian but the plot could well be about Ukraine At the Opera House in Kiev, the curtain rises on a story of love, rivalry and rejection. Up on stage, a poor peasant and an army sergeant compete for the hand of a fair maiden. The opera is 19th Century Italian, but the plot could well be 21st Century Ukraine.  This country, the second largest in Europe, is being courted by East and by West. The European Union has tempted Ukraine with the offer of a historic free trade and political association agreement; but Russia wants Kiev to join its own economic bloc.  The pressure on Ukraine to decide who to embrace has been huge.  That includes economic pressure. At the Roshen sweet factory in Kiev, thousands of little chocolates packed with nuts and cognac trundle down the production line.  Earlier this year Moscow banned imports from this, Ukraine's flagship confectionary company, citing health concerns. It imposed trade restrictions, too, on other Ukrainian companies. A not-so-subtle hint that Kiev should think twice before turning its back on Moscow. ""The whole world is absolutely clear that the real reason is political,"" says Roshen's owner, Petro Poroshenko.  Mr Poroshenko, a former Ukrainian foreign minister, says it was he who launched negotiations with Brussels on the Association Agreement back in 2007.  ""It's a form of pressure on Ukraine because of the necessity to make a strategic decision about our future development. We're fighting for our own future, our European future. ""And if I have to pay an enormous price, millions and millions in losses because of the Russian ban, then that is the price for freedom."" Last week the Ukrainian government announced its strategic decision. In a rowdy session of parliament, the country's prime minister said that the cabinet was putting on hold the Association Agreement with the EU: it would concentrate instead on repairing economic ties with Moscow.  ""Over the last year trade between Russia and Ukraine fell by 25%,"" Ukraine's Minister for Energy Eduard Stavitsky tells me. Russia banned imports from the Roshen sweet factory citing health concerns ""That's a huge blow to our economy and we can't ignore it.""  I ask the minister if Kiev had requested compensation from the EU.  ""I've attended many meetings with EU officials where this question was raised. We discussed this months ago. Unfortunately, all we got in return were declarations that Ukraine would profit from a deal with the EU in the medium to long term.  ""We need to progress from talking politics to more down to earth questions, like these economic issues."" The European Union rejects the idea it should compensate Ukraine for losses caused by Russia.  ""These losses are not because of the European Union Association Agreement,"" the EU's ambassador in Kiev Jan Tombinski explains.  ""They are because of a decision taken elsewhere. Probably we should ask the other partner to pay the compensation."" Kiev's decision to turn to the east looks like a defeat for Brussels and a geopolitical victory for Russia.  ""For nearly 20 years, Russia and the European Union have been conducting on the former Soviet space a zero-sum game,"" says Sergei Karaganov of Moscow's Council for Foreign and Defence Policy.   ""Russia has been winning and doesn't want to lose even a single point. But this game is to the detriment of Europe, because it loses the possibility of building up a relationship with Russia.  Pro-EU protesters have taken to the streets in Kiev ""It is clearly to the detriment of Russia because it is getting estranged from Europe. And it is simply terrible for the countries in between like the Ukrainian people who are suffering in this game tremendously."" The Ukrainian government's decision has sparked anger on the streets of Kiev, where pro-EU protesters have clashed with riot police. Demonstrators accuse the authorities of dragging Ukraine back to the Soviet Union - and President Viktor Yanukovych of selling out to Moscow to stay in power.  ""Yanukovych thinks about himself, about his personal chances to win the presidential election of 2015,"" says Serhiy Taran of Kiev's International Democracy Institute.  ""And what does he think? He thinks that the European Union would demand transparent and fair elections. But Russia wouldn't care about procedures during presidential elections."" In a televised address to the Ukrainian people on Monday night, President Yanukovych claimed he remained committed to a ""European Ukraine"". But, in a reference to the economic ""pressure"" Ukraine was under, he said his priority was to save jobs, protect pensions and maintain ""peace and calm"" in the country.  Back at the Opera, predictably, there is a happy end as the maiden falls in love with the peasant and they walk off into the sunset. On the political stage, of course, there is no romance - just pure calculation.  For now, the Ukrainian authorities have calculated that Moscow is their best choice. But President Yanukovych still plans to attend the EU summit - and he knows (because the polls tells him) that more Ukrainians favour closer ties with the EU than with Russia.  Perhaps there is still time for an unexpected twist before the curtain falls.

geopolitical tensions,The Middle East giant taking over Africa's ports,2024-09-15,2023-10-23,By Beverly Ochieng,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-67199490,"A multimillion-dollar deal signed between Emirati maritime giant DP World and Tanzania on Sunday looks set to further entrench the dominance of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in Africa's freight industry. Reports of the $250m (£205m) deal first emerged in July, sparking criticism by the opposition that it ""violated Tanzania's constitution and endangers national sovereignty"". Activists petitioned a court to halt the deal and were briefly detained for planning anti-government protests. The high court in Tanzania's south-western town of Mbeya dismissed the petition, paving the way for DP World to manage two-thirds of the Dar es Salaam port for the next 30 years. Transport Minister Makame Mbarawa - whose office did not respond to earlier requests for comment - said there would be no job losses and that Tanzania would retain 60% of earnings. DP World says it expects to triple revenue within a decade and speed up the clearance of vessels from the current average of 12 hours to 60 minutes. Chronic inefficiency, corruption allegations and competition in freight management by neighbouring Kenya are some of the underlying reasons why Tanzania President Samia Suluhu signed off on the agreement. ""People have a right to raise concerns because this is a democracy. And it is the government's job to act,"" she said during the signing in the administrative capital, Dodoma, downplaying public disquiet. The UAE is the fourth-largest investor in Africa, after China, Europe and the US. In the last decade, it has invested nearly $60bn in infrastructure and energy sectors across the continent.  DP World - established in 1999 and owned by Emirati ruling families - has increased those inroads with port operations in Angola, Djibouti, Egypt, Morocco, Mozambique, Senegal and Somalia.  In 2021, DP World pledged to invest $1bn in Africa over the next several years. These investments have at times sparked tensions, tested geopolitical relations and - more crucially - intensified competition for infrastructural development in Africa. Like China, Turkey and Russia, the UAE is increasingly becoming a political and economic counterweight to the West in Africa. Abu Dhabi's diplomatic presence has been boosted by humanitarian support and defence cooperation, particularly in the Horn of Africa.  It brokered a peace deal between Eritrea and Ethiopia in 2018, and delivered thousands of tonnes of food aid to Somalia in 2022 amid warnings of a looming famine. These relationships have given DP World a near monopoly in the Red Sea region, just north of Tanzania. They have also allowed the UAE to consolidate defence interests in the Gulf of Aden as part of an almost decade-long military offensive in Yemen. As a result, the UAE - despite its size - has an edge over other Gulf nations as the Horn of Africa is a strategic route for crude oil exports. DP World's developments in Somalia's Bossaso port and Berbera in the self-declared republic of Somaliland amount to almost $1bn. The agreements caused a row with the Somali federal government, which considers Somaliland to be part of its territory and has often had a turbulent relationship with the semi-autonomous Puntland region, which includes Bossaso. But DP World appears to have shrugged off political pressure to continue operations in both regions.  Its forays in Djibouti - a combination of military real estate and one of the busiest shipping routes in the world - could serve as a cautionary tale. Djibouti's attempts to seize the Doraleh Container Terminal, its biggest income generator and employer, from DP World triggered an expensive legal battle. In 2018, Djibouti handed the terminal over to Hong Kong-based China Merchants Port Holdings to protest against a decision by DP World to give neighbouring Ethiopia and Somaliland access to imports. But the maritime firm, which has a 50-year concession over the port from 2006, argued that the changeover violated its ""exclusive access"" to the region. The Hong Kong appeals court ordered Djibouti to pay DP World more than $600 million in damages, reasserting its tight grip. The lengthy lease in Dar es Salaam is not unusual. The Emirati firm's deals across the continent on the Atlantic coast have been characterised by similarly long-term agreements. In 2007, DP World edged out French interests in Senegal to win a $1.13bn contract to develop the Ndayane port near the capital, Dakar, which it will control for 25 years. The firm is set to earn more than $400m over a period of 20 years from a multi-purpose terminal concession agreement with Angola. Between these developments is the Democratic Republic of Congo's $1.2bn deep-sea port in Banana that will be completed by 2025. Part of the contention over DP World's presence in Tanzania is the perception that its operations are undermining local rights and management. DP World Group boss Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem said while in Dodoma that the Dar es Salaam port would become a ""world-class facility"". President Samia's predecessor, John Magufuli, had long shunned foreign investment and treated international partners with suspicion. But since taking over in 2021, Mrs Samia has sought various partnerships with the UAE as a means to ""address challenges and grab opportunities as quickly as possible"". DP World remains an anchor for the UAE to extend its geopolitical ambitions across Africa."
geopolitical tensions,Brexit: EU studies backstop while watching MPs in uproar,2024-09-15,2019-09-02,By Katya Adler,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-49553654,"As the UK steels itself for a week of edge-of-yer-seat high political drama, what do our ""negotiating partners"" in the EU make of it all?  I use inverted commas for ""negotiating partners"" because, despite UK government assertions, there are no real EU-UK negotiations currently taking place. Truth be told, EU leaders are pretty open-mouthed at what's going on across the Channel.  Italian colleagues mutter that these levels of deep political splits and spin, plus divisions and rampant uncertainty amongst the general public, are normally associated with their country - which, they are delighted to point out, is currently calmly (for once) digging itself out of a government crisis as I write. A cabinet minister in Finland, meanwhile, described himself as so gobsmacked by the idea that Prime Minister Boris Johnson will suspend parliament at such a time of political crisis, that he likened it to the Finnish government trying to announce a national ban on saunas (which they aren't intending to do, by the way). Finland currently holds the rotating EU presidency. But more senior EU leaders - such as those in France and Germany - have kept their thoughts on the UK political drama to themselves. Make no mistake though: they are monitoring the situation very carefully.  You see, for the EU this not at all about Boris Johnson v Jeremy Corbyn or the ""Rebel Alliance"" v Brexiteers in government. It's about damage limitation. Consider the fact that EU officials in Brussels have just announced they're debating whether to classify a no-deal Brexit as a ""major disaster"", so that affected EU countries can legally request compensation funding from the bloc's Solidarity Fund, usually reserved for floods, fires and earthquakes. There's a very stark contrast between the EU focus at the beginning of these negotiations - when Brussels wanted the UK to sign up to the most advantageous deal possible (from the EU perspective!) - and now, with a no-deal Brexit looming, when the EU is in full self-preservation mode.  Political leaders like Germany's Angela Merkel and the Netherlands' Mark Rutte are nervously wondering how they - and the bloc as a whole - can emerge from the Brexit drama as unscathed as possible.   Aware of the economic cost of no deal for them at home, plus the geopolitical impact of an acrimonious no-deal Brexit - which they believe would serve the interests of Donald Trump and Russia's Vladimir Putin above anyone else's - they are very keen indeed that a Brexit compromise deal be found, if possible.  But as ever, EU leaders' keenness to agree a Brexit deal should not be confused with a willingness to do whatever it takes.  EU Single Market concerns are paramount when looking at alternatives to the backstop guarantee for the open Irish border. Angela Merkel is certainly not chasing a deal ""at any price"". The EU will only make real compromises if Europe's leaders are convinced that their pain will definitely result in their gain.  That by the EU making change X or Y to the Brexit deal, then a majority in the UK parliament would be guaranteed to pass the revised deal.  Right now Brussels can see that Boris Johnson doesn't have the numbers. An election could change all that, of course. If it were held before the UK leaves the EU. If Boris Johnson were to win a majority. The prime minister is wrong to claim the UK's negotiating power is dependent on a credible no deal threat and is weakened purely by rebel MPs' push to prevent a no-deal Brexit by 31 October. EU leaders believe Mr Johnson is serious about no deal, but that alone is not enough to persuade them to make serious changes to the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement. It cannot be emphasised enough: Boris Johnson's parliamentary numbers are key. The PM said on Monday night that he doesn't want to hold an election (though rumours persist that he'll call one anyway). He also said he believes the chances of a deal with the EU are rising all the time. Things look and sound very different in Brussels. ""We can see Boris Johnson is playing a political game,"" a diplomat from a country traditionally very close to the UK told me. ""But we don't understand the rules or the strategy.""  Yes, the prime minister's EU envoy David Frost travels back and forth to Brussels. He is expected here on Wednesday and possibly again on Friday this week.  But the Johnson government has yet to put a workable alternative to the backstop on the table and the EU is waiting to see what happens in Westminster. Meanwhile, Mr Frost's visits are regarded in the EU as optics aimed at a UK domestic audience, rather than a serious opportunity to talk substance. The process is viewed across Europe with deep distrust. Officially, of course, the EU position is that it waits for London to come up with alternative solutions to replace the controversial backstop to keep the Irish border open after Brexit. But what would an acceptable alternative look like? Does it actually exist? EU figures are divided on this. Some in Brussels hope a win for Boris Johnson in Westminster would allow him to return to the original Northern Ireland-only backstop, as he would no longer be reliant for support in parliament on the Northern Ireland unionist DUP party.  That original backstop proposal would see only Northern Ireland remaining in a customs union with the EU and adhering to some single market rules - not the whole UK. EU diplomats say they could dress up the ""new old backstop"" as something different, to make it easier for Mr Johnson to sell back home.  And there are those in Brussels who even wonder if the prime minister could hold a referendum in Northern Ireland on whether to accept that backstop, safe in the knowledge that polls suggest the majority there are in favour. Though of course such a referendum could easily be manipulated into a de facto vote on Northern Ireland's political future instead. Another thought doing the Brussels rounds is that the EU may have to hold its nose and go for a sector-by-sector customs agreement for Northern Ireland, similar to the deal the bloc has (and had sworn never to replicate) with Switzerland.   But of course Switzerland has customs infrastructure on its EU borders, something that no-one wants to see in Ireland. Would Dublin accept some checks between Ireland and the rest of the EU to avoid a no-deal Brexit? The EU-UK route towards compromise is as fraught with difficulty as the current UK political impasse. There's only one bet that EU figures are happy to make at the moment: that the EU leaders' scheduled mid-October summit will not deliver their final word on deal or no deal.  Expect a Brexit-focused emergency EU summit (or two) before Halloween night is out."
geopolitical tensions,The mystery of the men who disappeared,2024-09-15,2020-01-22,Rahul Verma,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20200122-no-fathers-in-kashmir-the-men-who-disappeared,"A new film tells a love story between two teenagers whose fathers are both missing – in one of the most militarised places on Earth, writes Rahul Verma. In 2014, when Ashvin Kumar began making No Fathers In Kashmir, a feature film set in the disputed region of Kashmir, the director knew it would be fraught – but he didn’t expect a nine-month battle and censorship row to clear it for ‘public exhibition’ (cinema release) in India. Kumar had to heavily edit four scenes so that India’s Central Board of Film Certification would issue the film with a Universal Adult certificate (equivalent to PG) in April 2019. This week, the uncut version of No Fathers In Kashmir opens in UK cinemas, before being available for international audiences to view online in a couple of months. More like this:  - The female perspective on war  - How India’s ancient myths are being rewritten  - How India changed the English language The Indian director, who received an Academy Award nomination for his 2004 short film Little Terrorist, remains hugely frustrated with the protracted struggle and feels it was politically motivated. “A process that should have taken two to three weeks took nine months; the board went at the film with a machete; a piece of expression has been mutilated and vandalised in a process that was less about certification and more about showing us our place,” he says. (The board didn't respond to our request for a comment.) The film is politically sensitive because Kashmir is a disputed territory, claimed by India and Pakistan, with the nuclear-armed neighbours fighting three wars over it (in 1947, 1965 and 1999) and nearly starting a fourth in February 2019. For three decades, Kashmir has been devastated by a bloody conflict between Indian forces and an armed insurgency, with conservative estimates putting the death toll at around 40,000 since 1989. Current events and recent history characterises Kashmir as a place of turmoil, but it wasn’t so long ago that the breathtakingly beautiful Himalayan region was known as ‘heaven on Earth’ thanks to its snowcapped peaks, magnificent valleys, Alpine-esque forests, crystal-clear lakes, glistening glaciers and renowned Kashmiri warmth and hospitality. Kashmir was on the hippie-travel trail – Ravi Shankar taught George Harrison to play the sitar on a houseboat on Dal Lake, Srinagar – and its idyllic scenery was as much a star of Bollywood films as the leading actors of the day, thanks to its reputation as the ‘Switzerland of India’. My mum has happy memories of going to university in Kashmir’s capital of Srinagar in the late 1960s, crossing Dal Lake by boat on her daily commute to campus, visiting Char Chinar, a small island in the middle of the lake that’s home to four striking Chinar trees, and hiking and sledging at the Pahalgam hill station. Tragically, that couldn’t be further removed from the place numbed and traumatised by oppression and insurgency in Kumar’s poignant film. No Fathers in Kashmir is the story of a teenager, Noor (Zara Webb), who is dragged from Birmingham in the UK to Kashmir to see her grandparents, and meets local lad Majid (Shivam Raina). Noor and Majid’s blossoming romance intensifies when they learn their missing abus (fathers) were best friends and are among the thousands of Kahsmiri men who have disappeared after being picked up by the army. Noor seeks answers and discovers that the valley’s forests hide mass graves, and in a chilling scene is told dogs have developed a taste for human flesh through raiding the shallow graves – “the dogs of Kashmir, not like normal dogs”. Little Terrorist and Kumar’s National Award-winning documentaries Inshallah, Football (2010) and Inshallah, Kashmir (2012) share similar themes with No Fathers in Kashmir. He chose to tell this story through teenagers in order to make it relatable and to speak to young India. “By telling a naive story of innocent teenagers and first love, the idea was to take people back to that time in their lives when geopolitics is alien to you – but in Kashmir, politics creeps into the personal lives of these kids,” he says. “I balanced that with the metaphors of disappeared fathers, mass graves, and wives and mothers who are waiting for news of what’s happened to their disappeared husbands and sons. “I wanted to appeal to young Indians because they’re born in the 1990s, after economic liberalisation gave them choice, opportunity and the chance to shape their destiny. For young people in Kashmir, choice and opportunity do not exist, they are born into war and conflict, and their cries against oppression and for self-determination are not heard.” In India, the film has been acclaimed for thoughtfully and sensitively shining a light on ordinary day-to-day life in an extraordinary place, being a teenager in one of the most heavily militarised places on the planet (India has an estimated 500,000 soldiers in the state of Jammu and Kashmir). Academy Award-nominated and Bafta award-winning director Mira Nair (Monsoon Wedding) said: “It’s a very brave film and it’s a timely film. It’s also a moving film and it’s beautifully performed and skilfully made. I think it’s also poignant to see war through the eyes of the children.” Nuanced art and culture focusing on the human tragedy in Kashmir is in short supply. The devastating independent film Haider (2014), an adaptation of Hamlet, and Hamid (2018) are notable exceptions, along with searing graphic novel Munnu (2015) by Kashmiri illustrator and newspaper cartoonist Malik Sajad. Kumar hopes that No Fathers in Kashmir will help people move beyond dehumanising stereotypes, and trigger discussion about – and empathy for – the cost of a conflict that shows little sign of resolution. “For Kashmiris, the average Indian is a soldier in jack boots and camouflage and carrying a gun, and for Indians the average Kashmiri is a kid throwing stones at the army – these are the caricatures that have been propagated for the last 30 years. I hope that as the film is seen by UK and international audiences it will stimulate support, debate, curiosity, awareness, and compassion for the situation that Kashmiris find themselves in.” Waiting for change In August 2019, the situation in Kashmir evolved dramatically, with India revoking the region’s special status, placing Jammu and Kashmir under direct rule, and imposing a communications ban and media blackout, as well as deploying tens of thousands more troops. According to Human Rights Watch, thousands of Kashmiris, including political leaders, activists, journalists, lawyers, and protesters, have been detained. The impact on day-to-day life has been severe. “For five months schoolchildren have not been able to go to school, so students have missed important exams, electricity has been switched off, Kashmiri students studying in other parts of India have not been able to access course fees or medical fees,” says Kumar. “All government services are online, whether applying to college, for a driving licence, pension or medical card – 7.5 million Kashmiris have not been able to do anything.” Last week the internet ban was partially lifted but a social media ban remains in place – the longest suspension of internet services by any democracy in history. More than five years after Kumar began making this film on the suffering in Kashmir, it’s more relevant than ever. “It’s been a tough trek, we’ve been making this film for five years. and we’ve had issue after issue, but the fact that we’re here is a miracle,” he says. “The film is about waiting: wives, mothers and daughters who are waiting for information on their loved ones – husbands, sons and fathers who have disappeared. What we’ve been through isn’t anything that Kashmiris have had to endure.” Love film? Join BBC Culture Film Club on Facebook, a community for film fanatics all over the world.

geopolitical tensions,Do we need a world without borders?,2024-09-15,2022-11-18,Gaia Vince,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20221117-how-borders-might-change-to-cope-with-climate-migration,"With up to three billion people expected to be displaced by the effects of global warming by the end of the century, should it lead to a shift in the way we think about national borders, asks Gaia Vince? I've had an obsession with maps ever since I first sought my bearings in Winnie the Pooh's ""Hundred Aker Wood"", trying to discover where was ""nice for piknicks"", and the locations of the characters' houses. My childhood was spent studying and drawing treasure maps, charting imaginary lands and plotting routes to faraway places I longed to visit. Today, my home is plastered with the maps I've collected or been given – reminders of places that are special to me. By my desk, I have a large world map, the continents distinguished from the oceans by their mosaic of colours. Each coloured patch is a country, separated from its neighbour by a neat line drawn onto this two-dimensional representation of our world. Comment & analysis Gaia Vince is the author of Nomad Century: How to Survive the Climate Upheaval (2022, Allen Lane). The borders are cleanly defined, ink separating nationalities destined for different fates. For me, these lines mark exciting possibilities, with the potential for exploration and adventure, to visit foreign cultures with different foods and languages. For others, they are prison walls that limit all possibilities. Borders define our fate, our life expectancy, our identity, and so much more. Yet they are an invention just like the maps I used to draw. Our borders don't exist as immutable facets of the landscape, they are not natural parts of our planet, and were invented relatively recently. It can be argued, however, that most of these imaginary lines are not fit for the world of the 21st Century with its soaring population, dramatic climate change and resource scarcity. Indeed, the idea of keeping foreign people out using borders is relatively recent. States used to be far more concerned about stopping people from leaving than preventing their arrival. They needed their labour and taxes, and emigration still poses a headache for many states. There are, however, true human borders set not by politics or hereditary sovereigns, but by the physical properties of our planet. These planetary borders for our mammal species are defined by geography and climate. Humans cannot live in large numbers in Antarctica or in the Sahara Desert, for instance. As global temperatures increase, causing climate change, sea level rise and extreme weather over the coming decades, large parts of the world that are home to some of the biggest populations will become increasingly hard to live in. Coastlines, island states and major cities in the tropics will be among the hardest hit, according to predictions by climate scientists. Unable to adapt to increasingly extreme conditions, millions – or even billions – of people will need to move. The most densely populated areas of the planet are clustered around the 25-26th north parallels which has traditionally been the latitude of most comfortable climate and fertile land. An estimated 279 million people are packed into this thin band of land, which cuts through countries including India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, China, the United States and Mexico. But the conditions here are changing. On average, climate niches – the range of conditions at which species can normally exist – around the world are moving polewards at a pace of 1.15m (3.8ft) per day, although it's far faster in some places. Adapting to the changing climate will mean chasing our own shifting niche – which for much of human history has been within the temperature range -11C to 15C (12F to 59F) – as it migrates north from the equator. True livability limits are the borders we must worry about as the world warms over this century, bringing unbearable heat, drought, floods, fires, storms, and coastal erosion that make agriculture impossible and displace people. Already record numbers of people are being forced to flee their homes with each passing year. In 2021, there were 89.3 million people, double the number forcibly displayed a decade ago, and in 2022 that number reached 100 million, with climate disasters displacing many more people than conflicts. Floods displaced 33 million people in Pakistan this year, while millions more in Africa have been affected by drought and the threat of famine, from the Horn of Africa to the continent's west coast. UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi appealed to global leaders at the COP27 climate change conference to take bold action to tackle the humanitarian consequences of global warming. That change needs to be ""transformational"" according to the UNHRC. ""We cannot leave millions of displaced people and their hosts to face the consequences of a changing climate alone,"" says Grandi. Without action, hundreds of millions people will have to leave their homes by 2050, according some estimates. One study from 2020 predicts that by 2070, depending on scenarios of population growth and warming, ""one to three billion people are projected to be left outside the climate conditions that have served humanity well over the past 6,000 years"". With so many people on the move, will this mean that invented political borders, ostensibly imposed for national security, become increasingly meaningless? The threat posed by climate change and its social reper­cussions dwarf those surrounding national security. Heatwaves already kill more people than those who die as a direct result of violence in wars. Compounding this, the global population is still growing, particularly in some of the regions worst hit by cli­mate change and poverty. Populations in Africa are set to almost triple by 2100, even as those elsewhere slow in growth. This means there will be a greater number of people in the very areas that are likely to be worst affected by extreme heat, drought and catastrophic storms. A greater number of people will also need food, water, power, housing and resources, just as these become ever ­harder to supply. Meanwhile, most countries in the Global North are facing a demographic crisis in which people are not having enough babies to support an ageing population. Managed mass migration could thus help with many of the world's biggest problems, reducing the number of people living in poverty and climate devastation, and helping northern economies build their workforce. But the main barrier is our system of borders – movement restrictions either imposed by someone's own state or by the states they wish to enter. Today just over 3% of the global population are international migrants. However, migrants contrib­ute around 10% of global GDP or $6.7tn (£5.9tn) – some $3tn (£2.6tn) more than they would have produced in their origin coun­tries. Some economists, such as Michael Clemens at the Center for Global Development in the US, calculate that enabling free movement could double global GDP. In addition, we would see an increase in cultural diversity, which studies show improves innovation. At a time when we have to solve unprecedented environmental and social challenges, it could be just what is needed. How to think about X This series will change the way you look at the world. Whether it's the concept of ""time"", ""consumerism"", or even ""creativity"", many of us tend to think about – and define – certain ideas in the ways we’ve been taught. But how did our conceptualisation of these big ideas evolve? How to Think About X searches for new ideas about our lives, the concepts that govern them and our future. Removing borders or making them far more flexible, especially to labour flows, has the potential to improve humanity's resilience to the stresses and shocks of global climate change. Managed well, migration could benefit everyone. What if we thought of the planet as a global commonwealth of humanity, in which people were free to move wherever they wanted? We'd need a new mechanism to manage global labour mobility far more effect­ively and efficiently – it is our biggest economic resource, after all. There are already wide­-ranging global trade deals for the movement of other resources and products, but few that deal with labour movement. Some 60% of the world's population is under the age of 40, half of these (and growing) under 20, and they will form most of the world's people for the rest of this century. Many of these young, energetic jobseekers are likely to be among those moving as the climate changes – will they add to economic growth to build sustainable societies, or will their talents be wasted? The conversation about migration has become stuck on what ought to be allowed, rather than planning for what will occur. I believe nations need to move on from the idea of controlling migration to managing migra­tion. At the very least, we need new mechanisms for lawful economic labour migration and mobility, and far better protection for those fleeing danger. Everyone could be offered an official form of United Nations citizenship in addition to their birth citizenship. For some people, such as those born in refugee camps, lacking papers, or citizens of small island states that will cease to exist later this century, UN citizenship may well be their only access to international recognition and assistance, even though citizenship is a human right. Passports could be issued on the back of this. The political theorist David Held argued that we have outgrown our national bound­aries through increasing globalisation, and now live in ""overlapping communities of fate"" from where we should form a cosmopolitan democracy at a global level. Today, we are experiencing a planetary crisis and I believe it is time to see ourselves as members of one globally dispersed species that must cooperate to survive. The scale of the climate crisis requires new global cooperation and, I believe, new international citizenship with global bodies for migration and for the biosphere – new authorities that are paid for by our taxes and to which nation states are accountable. Currently, the United Nations has no executive powers over nation states, but that may well need to change if we are to bring down global temperatures, reduce the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and restore the world's biodiversity. Global governance could also be useful in coordinating the vast new mobile workforce, perhaps using an international quota system to help allocate people to positions during the mass climate migrations of this century. But it would also face challenges created by bureaucracy, corruption and lobbying by powerful corporations. Underpinning global governance, however, there also needs to be strong states. The tension between the desires and needs of the individual and society are very real for us all, and hard enough to reconcile when our society is a small, closely knit group, let alone the population of the whole planet. It's hard to care, for example, about a nameless, faceless stranger in a country you've never visited when making choices about your own life in a city thousands of miles from them. Most people find hard to balance the needs of a stranger one street away. Successful nation states help to manage this with structures and institutions that ensure a useful level of cooperation between strangers that nurtures a strong society in which we all can succeed. We willingly make small, daily sacrifices of time, energy and resources as individuals – paying taxes, for instance – to ensure our societies operate. Most of us do this because it's our society, our social family, our nation state. The invention of the nation state has been a very powerful tool in enabling us to cooperate so well. As the political theorist David Miller put it: ""Nations are communities that do things together."" It would seem unwise, then, to try to completely dismantle or abandon our existing geopolitical system in the brief time we have to prepare for the massive disruption that is expected to occur over the course of this century. Only strong nation states will be capable of setting up the systems of governance that will help our species survive climate change. Only strong nation states will be able to manage a massive movement of migrants from different geographies and cultures to the native population. It may instead require a blend between internationalism and nation­alism. In recent decades, the growth of globalisation has led to greater internationalism – a citizen of London may often feel more commonality with a citizen of Amsterdam or Taiwan than with someone from a small country town in Britain. This may not matter for many successful urbanites, but natives of more rural areas can feel left behind by their own country as once dominant industries decline, and social spaces and cultural traditions dwindle away. This creates resentment and fear of the kind that can lead to prejudice against immigrants, as was seen in parts of the UK during the Brexit debate. Open borders do not have to mean no borders or the abolition of nation states, though. It may be necessary to explore different types of nation states, with different governance options. Will states that are most affected by climate change buy or rent territory in safer places? Or will we see charter cities that operate under different jurisdictions and rules to the territory surrounding them, or floating states that build new territory on the waves? It will take work to reinvent the concept of the nation state so it becomes more inclusive so that it strengthens local connections while forging greater and more equitable global networks. There are multiple benefits in encouraging commonality, a kinship with our fellows, based on our shared societal project, language and cultural works. These traits matter to people enough to make patriotism a powerful source of identity. So why not also engender patriotic feeling about our nations' air, land and water, to encourage people to look after them.? One approach, since we all face environmental threats, might be to enlist military and other security institu­tions in the struggle against climate change. National service for younger citizens and immigrants to help with dis­aster relief, nature restoration, agricultural and social efforts could be another solidarity-creating step. And we may need to restore or invent new national traditions that are environmentally or socially beneficial, and for which citizens can feel pride and respect. These could include social groups and clubs that sing, create, play sport or perform together, and to which members can belong for life. These traditions can help main­tain dignity in hard times and provide patriotic meaning for immigrants to assimilate to. The new patriotic narrative could be about civic nationalism, based on the common good, with rights and duties, and a passionate cultural attachment to nature, and to protecting and conserving places of national (or inter­national) importance. Costa Rica, for instance, embraced the term pura vida, broadly meaning ""good life"", as a national ethos, mantra and identity. Its use became widespread from the 1970s, when refugees from the violent conflicts in neighbouring Guatemala, Nicaragua and El Salvador relocated to the country in large numbers. Costa Rica, a small Central American country that has no standing army and instead invests heavily in nature protection and restor­ation alongside social services such as health and education, used this outlook on life to help define its character and integrate new immigrants. ""A person choosing to use this phrase thus is not only alluding to this shared ideology and identity, he/she is at the same time constructing that identity by means of expressing it,"" says Anna Marie Trester of New York University. ""Language is a very important tool of self­-construction."" This offers us a new way of looking at national pride. It doesn't have to mean seeing ""your people"" as better than other nations', nor does it mean a centralisation of meaning and power. Instead, it can involve the devolution of traditions and an appreciation of regionality and of the enormous cultural value of new citizens. The European Union is an example of supranational identity that allows citizens to feel they are European and identify with the values of the EU,  but without having to give up their national identity. A similar idea can apply within nations as well as between them. In the UK, for instance, London's Chinatown is rightly a much­-visited tourist destination, as is Little India – they are part of the nation's identity, even though Chinese­ Brits and British Indians often face prejudice and socioeconomic disadvantage. To earn national pride rather than suffer divisive tribalism, a nation needs to reduce inequality. The state must invest in the people for the people to feel invested in the state. That means putting social and environmental issues first in ways that are for the benefit of all, rather than a small tribe of global aristocrats. The Green New Deals proposed in the European Union and the US are examples of policies aimed at restoring econo­mies, providing jobs and boosting dignity while helping unite people in a bigger social project of environmental transformation. Try, if you will, to clear from your mind the idea of people being fixed to a location they were born in, as if it affects your value as a person or your rights as an individual. As if nationality were anything more than an arbitrary line drawn on a map. See instead these lines as fusions of cultural richness, transitions rather than barriers across the possibilities that Earth's lands offer us all. * Gaia Vince is the author of Nomad Century: How to Survive the Climate Upheaval and a freelance science journalist and broadcaster. -- Join one million Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.

geopolitical tensions,The most vital resource of the century?,2024-09-15,2017-06-16,Bryan Lufkin,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20170615-why-hydro-politics-will-shape-the-21st-century,"It's been called the 'next oil'. In the coming decades, the supply of water has the potential to influence geopolitics, diplomacy and even conflict. Grand Challenges In this special series, Future Now takes a close look at the biggest, most important issues we face in the 21st Century. For two months, we'll bring you insight from leading scientists, technologists, entrepreneurs and influencers to help you make sense of the challenges we face in today's rapidly evolving world. The 2008 James Bond film Quantum of Solace pits 007 against an evil criminal syndicate bent on global domination. Sounds par for the course… but this particular network of baddies isn’t using lasers or missiles to cause havoc. No, the Quantum organisation has a uniquely dastardly plan: seizing control of Bolivia’s water supply. While the evil syndicate’s role in the film might not be entirely realistic, this piece of fiction does raise a scenario that is worth considering seriously: what would happen if a country’s water supply was cut off? What would be the global fallout? Think about it: sure, we need water to survive. But it also fuels a country’s commerce, trade, innovation and economic success. This has been the case for time immemorial, from the Nile in Ancient Egypt to the Amazon in the Brazilian rainforest. While bodies of water typically help form natural borders of countries, several nations tend to share access to rivers or lakes – the Nile runs through nearly a dozen countries alone, for example. Given how conflict-prone humankind is, it’s surprising there haven't been more dust-ups of a “hydro-political” nature. Experts agree: if there was no access to water, there would be no world peace. That’s why one of the grand challenges of the next few decades could be maintaining this ultra-sensitive stasis of water management. In the 21st Century, freshwater supplies are drying up, climate change is raising sea levels and altering borders, explosive population growth is straining world resources, and global hyper-nationalism is testing diplomatic relations. Meanwhile, water demand is expected to go up 55% between 2000 and 2050. In the coming century, in terms of its value as a global resource, it’s been described as “the next oil."" So what can we do to guarantee global access to water – and thus global peace? World peace hinges on hydro-politics Water’s role in shaping politics goes back centuries. “In the ancient world, large bodies of water formed natural boundaries for people and nations,” says Zenia Tata, executive director of global development and international expansion at XPrize, an organisation that’s holding a worldwide competition for innovative water management solutions. “But today’s geopolitical landscape looks very different,” and access to water remains paramount. In many areas of the world, bodies of water run through several countries or brush up against many countries’ borders. That’s where something called ""riparian water rights"" come into play. In the case of a river, upstream countries – where the river originates – enjoy inherent power and leverage over the downstream countries. These kinds of riparian hotspots abound. And they’re often in places that are already fraught. In the Middle East, the Jordan River basin is the primary water source for many regions, including Jordan, Palestine, and Israel, regions of long-standing political tensions. In Syria, meanwhile, the worst drought in close to a millennium has been partly blamed for the country’s generation-defining civil war and radicalisation that led to the formation of so-called Islamic State. Egypt and Ethiopia have sparred over development of water from the River Nile for centuries: the iconic river originates in Ethiopia but ends in Egypt, which sets up an inherently combative relationship. In 2015, Egypt and Ethiopia put enough differences aside to construct the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam on the river, which is Africa’s largest dam and is due to open in July. The countries also signed a deal that strives to ensure fair river access. Tata points to many developed or emerging markets that have had similar challenges: “Take the example of Malaysia’s 99-year deal with Singapore, giving them paid access to fresh water from the Johor River,” Tata says. “Singapore is arguably one of the most progressive nations on our planet, but without sufficient fresh water resources within its boundaries, all industry, trade, commerce and culture would all stand still."" According to the Pacific Institute, a California-based water resource information nonprofit, there have been dozens of water-related conflicts worldwide from 2000BC to present day. So how do we make sure everyone gets enough water – and thus keep relative world peace in the 21st Century? The real answer won’t lie in countries controlling others’ water supply in what’s been dubbed so-called ""water wars"" – rather, the answer might lie in how countries with more food and water export those supplies to other countries. Divvying up water supplies While there have been many “water-related” conflicts over the millennia, there have actually been very few in terms of sending water over national boundaries. There are three main issues when it comes to water in the 21st Century, says Aaron Wolf. He’s a professor of geography at Oregon State University who specialises in water resource management and environmental policy. The first issue is the most obvious: water scarcity. A lack of safe, reliable water kills as many people worldwide as malaria and HIV/Aids, he says. The second issue is the political implications of that scarcity. For example, in Syria, that history-making drought drove more people to cities, saw rising food prices, and exacerbated tensions in the country that already existed. They ended up with “climate refugees”, who travel to other countries to seek places that have better water availability, which may in turn stoke the flames of political tension. The third main issue – and perhaps the most underreported, experts say – is that trans-boundary flow of water. In other words: water moving between countries. And that’s where those riparian rights come into play. But here’s the twist – that third part of the puzzle, the hydro-politics, is actually the part to be most optimistic about, says Wolf, since there have been so few violent skirmishes over transboundary water flows. The grand challenge: building hydro-diplomacy Despite alarmist headlines about “water wars”, the 21st Century is still offering up no shortage of new and unique threats that complicate hydro-diplomacy more than ever before. Population explosions, especially in Asia and Africa, strain resources. Increasing global temperatures have led to some bodies of water drying up. And rising nationalism worldwide may stymie diplomatic efforts across the board. So that’s why at Oregon State University, Wolf helps organise the Program in Water Conflict Management – where they try to identify where hydro-diplomatic tensions are going to rise in the next three to five years. For example, Afghanistan is an upstream country to many nations in the region, and is trying to use that advantage to develop its economy. For a country that’s been subjected to decade upon decade of war and upheaval, the political power of water sources like the Kabul River could be a boon. That’s why there’s growing academic desire for an increased awareness of not just hydro-politics, but hydro-diplomacy – that while water presents obvious potential conflict, it could also accelerate global cooperation. “We’re building the next generation of hydro-diplomats,” says Wolf. A solution? Pay farmers more But amid all these changes in the aqua political landscape, experts urge us to remember that not all water exists in rivers and lakes and even oceans. There’s water in the soil – the soil that farmers use to grow vegetables, crops and feed for livestock. And the water from that soil is transferred into these products – whether it is wheat or beef – ­before they get shipped from water-surplus nations to deficient ones. This is known as “virtual water”,­ a phrase coined by John Anthony Allan at King’s College London, whose specialities include water issues, policy and agriculture. ""Virtual water"" is going to play a huge role in the 21st Century. If you include virtual water in the picture, farmers are managing much of the water in the supply chain. And in countries that are water deficient, that imported embedded water is integral. In Europe alone, 40% of this ""virtual water"" comes from outside the continent. Here’s the problem: farmers are underpaid for the critical role in that transaction. And by the time the food reaches the destination country, its politicians use subsidies to keep food prices low. The reason? Politicians want to maintain peace among their people – they want their citizens to live under the assumption that they’ll be able go to the store and expect food on the shelves. “Governments go to great lengths to make sure there is enough affordable food on the market,” Allan says. “There are forces in places that will bring the prices down – there’s pressure to keep food cheap."" For water-surplus countries like the United States or Canada, they sell these products to more water-deficient countries at a low price. Over 60% of the around 220 countries in the world are major food importers. In other words, 160 countries depend on imported food – and the water needed to make it. “The world is at peace because we have virtual water trade,” says Allan. “It’s solved silently. Revealing virtual water trade as a solution is something that politicians don’t want to do because they want to appear as they’re managing their country well.” But in reality, the water that goes into the country's food is being brought in from elsewhere. That’s why hydro-diplomacy is one of the great unsung heroes in maintaining global stability that you never hear about. It’s also why water’s next big challenge isn’t just making sure it’s judiciously and peaceably managed between nations to accommodate the world’s ever-burgeoning population. It’s about helping farmers who live in nations that have lots of water do their jobs successfully, and manage that water and how it’s distributed to drier places. Of course countries need low-priced food, especially in places with lower income citizens. But the public needs to know that imports, exports, and hydro-diplomacy are what really keep countries with imbalanced water sources in balance. In our globalised, 21st Century world, it's not just about where countries fall along the flow of a river. It's about working together to share Earth's most vital resource. So while a James Bond-scale water hostage situation isn’t exactly realistic – there’s nothing unrealistic about needing to maintain worldwide access to water. Even as we use it to slake our thirst and grow our crops, the political power of water shouldn’t be forgotten. It's been around for millennia, and it's not going anywhere.  -- Bryan Lufkin is the editor of Future Now. Follow him on Twitter @bryan_lufkin.

geopolitical tensions,The people with no word for dinosaur,2024-09-15,2020-01-17,Christine Ro,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200116-what-happens-when-you-have-no-word-for-dinosaur,"English is the world’s dominant scientific language, yet it has no word for the distinctive smell of cockroaches. What happens though, if you have no words for basic scientific terms? Just what is a fossil, anyway? Whether the question is posed to 12-year-olds studying science or adults going about their daily business, many would struggle to explain. For Zulu-speaking South African schoolchildren working with science communicator Sibusiso Biyela, an added challenge has been not just grasping the concept in English, but translating it back into Zulu, which doesn’t have words for such terms. While Zulu, or isiZulu as it is called in South Africa, is spoken by almost 12 million people, it lacks the words for communicating many scientific concepts. Ilahle (“coal”), suggested one girl. It makes sense, since coal is a fossil fuel. A boy came up with a version of amathambo amadala atholakala emhlabathini (“old bones found in the ground”). This translation is intuitive but imperfect, as plants can be fossils as well. You might also like: • Why you might be counting in the wrong language • What single word defines who you are • The simple words that save lives Around the world, enterprising individuals often have to come up with local translations of scientific concepts. These can be lyrical, like bisaatsinsiimaan (“beautiful plantings”) for Einstein’s theory of relativity, devised by a mother-son duo who were translating astrophysics into the indigenous North American language Blackfoot, or Siksiká. Or the neologisms can be focused on efficiency. This motivated one Scottish medical student to create a British Sign Language sign for a single piece of DNA , in place of the tediously finger-spelled “deoxyribonucleotide”. Ultimately, Biyela believes, the actual words used aren’t the most important things. “The impact has not been the words themselves, it’s been the formula to come up with the words,” he says. Earlier this year he documented the formula he developed for Zulu in a powerful article for The Open Notebook, which elicited solidarity around the world from people facing similar issues (and also inspired this article). The formula is crucial for developing Zulu terms for concepts that English speakers often take for granted, from “immune system” to “dinosaur”. This process creates an opportunity to correct some of the biases and errors embedded in the English terms. As Biyela points out, “dinosaur” is a misnomer, as it derives from the Greek word for “terrible lizard”. He opted for isilwane sasemandulo (“ancient animal”) instead.  In some cases where there are coinages for scientific words or medical conditions, they can end up reflecting inaccuracies and stigmas that persist in certain culture, such as describing a person with Down’s syndrome as a dumazi (“dwarf”) or ndondocha (“zombie”) in Swahili. This is why it also helps to have a more rigorous formula for creating new words, argues Biyela. In some cases, however, neologisms can be perfectly poetic compared to their English equivalents. The clinical-sounding “immune system” has a more descriptive variant in Zulu: amasosha omzimba, which translates as “bodily soldiers”. This exemplifies how healthcare workers around the world explain a condition in lay terms that will be understood locally. “We go about in a round way,” says Pradip Narzary, a doctor in the North Indian village of Tukrajhar. He draws a circle in the air for emphasis. In the local Boro language, he might refer to a mass rather than a uterine growth, or talk about water collections on a kidney rather than renal cysts. There are some cases, of course, where the English words are widely understood and then he uses them – such as “tumour” and “cancer”. In many languages, however, medical workers and scientists themselves might not know the local terms for scientific concepts, if they exist, because relatively few textbooks and scientific papers are published in minority languages. For instance, the scientific establishment may not be aware of folk and indigenous terms for plants. Suzi Oliveira de Lima, a University of Toronto linguist who focuses on Brazilian indigenous languages, explains other strategies for communicating concepts when the words aren’t there. In the Amazonian language Yudja, spoken by fewer than a thousand people, one strategy is to borrow words from Brazilian Portuguese, tweaking them to make them sound more Yudja. Yudja speakers often also reference the function of the object, such as axi saasaka, (“fire that flashes”) for “flashlight”, or the sound it makes, as in kiriri, which captures the sound of a zipper for the word “backpack”. Whether the language is spoken by billions or hundreds, it is worth considering the relevance of translating scientific terms. That can be tricky. For while Yudja contains many words for the starchy plant manioc, and Zulu traditional healers have named plenty of plant species that remain outside of Western medicine, English is a repository of many unique scientific words. In addition to having an unusually large vocabulary, English is now the dominant scientific language (a position previously enjoyed by German). There are stark contrasts between English’s scientific dominance and, for instance, the language of a stateless minority. “Many academic words or scientific and marketing words are really lost in translation in the Rohingya community,” says A K Rahim, a sociolinguist for the non-profit Translators without Borders. More generally, “We have to think of languages in terms of…where is this culture in terms of historical trajectory or in terms of scientific progress, because some cultures haven’t been exposed to the Industrial Revolution.” As a historically oral language, “the Rohingya language lacks words for concepts like paragraph, sentence, essay, etc,” Rahim says. Mathematical terms might be borrowed from Burmese, while the word for “word” is derived from Arabic. Consequently, communication between Rohingya refugees and aid workers in Bangladeshi refugee camps has had to involve mutual learning, creativity and sensitivity. It’s been challenging for aid workers to explain the concepts of nutrition and nutrients, for instance. Thus “nutrition packets” (or food-containing aid packages) are often called shuji, which means “semolina” because the powdery content inside looks like the coarse durum wheat flour that the Rohingya people traditionally use to make porridge or puddings. This isn’t just a matter of conversation. “Not knowing the word for ‘diarrhoea’ or not knowing the word for ‘vaccine’ could be very dangerous,” Rahim points out. Translators without Borders are recording a glossary, based on discussions with Rohingya speakers from different refugee camps, and from multiple generations and dialects. The hope is that eventually speakers of Turkish, English, Rohingya and Chittagonian (a Bangladeshi language) can all understand the meanings of even very localised words. But vaccines, flashlights and dinosaurs are all concrete items. What about more elusive items, like those that refer to the senses? As University of York psycholinguist Asifa Majid and her colleagues have found, many European languages are very limited in describing smells. Thai is much more descriptive, and Thai speakers communicate about odours much more often, including terms like hʉ̌ʉn and měn hʉ̌ʉn (associated with oil for frying), sàap (for the odour of cockroaches), and hɔ̌ɔm grùn (for warm foods like bread fresh out of the oven). Unsurprisingly, smells are very important to religious and culinary practices in Thailand. It’s hard to grasp the absence of a term, so here’s an example of a fairly recent entry into the English lexicon: the Japanese flavour term umami. “Scientists discovered the taste receptor that’s sensitive to umami, MSG, things like that, in the early 1900s,” explains Majid. “But it wasn’t accepted in Western science until the 1980s…That’s an interesting case, where the science and the public acceptance go hand-in-hand.” It wasn’t that Westerners couldn’t taste the umami flavour until they had a word to describe it. But they didn’t find it as easy to practise that perceptual ability. “It wasn’t something that was as accessible to people. I think that having language does make it more salient in consciousness,” says Majid. That is an intriguing point when it comes to scientific terms, but it is important to note that even if a language lacks a certain term, it might not suggest a radically different worldview. For instance, Brazilian linguist de Lima says Yudja “is a language that in the past did not have native words for measuring”. While fluency with mathematical language does affect the ability to do arithmetic, this doesn’t mean that Yudja people didn’t measure substances before borrowing the Portuguese word litro. Instead, they might have used fingers (like “feet” in English) to express height. (Read more abouthow we measure without using mathematics.) “When you cannot find an exact translation for a particular concept,” de Lima stresses, it might be that speakers of that language express it in a different way. To give another example, not having words for units of time like “hour” doesn’t mean a society lacks a notion of time. Instead, Yudja culture traditionally tracks time in terms of how often the sun rises or its position in the sky. (Read more about why we often think about time in the wrong way.) Ultimately, the world is enriched by understanding these variations in concepts like “old bones” and “fire that flashes”. Queen’s University linguist Anastasia Riehl gives one example among Lulamogi speakers in Uganda, for example, who “worry that as people forget the dozens of terms that describe methods of trapping and eating white ants – such as okukunia, okutegerera, and okubuutira – they will forget this important cultural practice”. More generally, Majid says “the fact that we see different aspects of experience are more or less expressible in different languages brings up the possibilities of borrowing the tricks that the other languages have developed”. This raises some tantalising possibilities. Perhaps if English weren’t so limited in describing smell, while being so focused on vision, inventors would have long ago created the equivalent of glasses for the nose. -- Join one million Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.

geopolitical tensions,The high cost of avoiding the draft,2024-09-15,2016-11-03,Louise Redvers,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20161101-the-high-cost-of-avoiding-the-draft,"Global tensions are leading some countries to reconsider conscription. But while it can be a career boost for some, for others it’s to be avoided at all costs. Across Europe, tens of thousands of young men – and some women – could soon be served with draft papers and required to serve in their national militaries. Conscription was phased out by most European countries after the Cold War, but amid growing geopolitical uncertainty following Russia’s annexing of Crimea, a number of countries are rethinking their civil defence capacity. Meanwhile, throughout the continent, domestic terror attacks and the rise of antagonist right wing politics has sparked fresh conversations about issues of national cohesion and identity. Germany, France, Poland and Sweden are among the countries where there is a debate about bringing back mandatory national service in some form, be it military or civil. Ukraine and Lithuania have already passed laws to formalise the draft, and Norway, which like Finland has maintained conscription, has now made it compulsory for women as well as men. “Given the resurgence of Russia on the borders of Europe, a lot of countries are re-thinking their strategies on conscription and national defence,” says Elizabeth Quintana, director of military science at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), a think-tank. This scenario in Europe has come about because of perceived threats from Russia, but conscription is in fashion for other reasons too, says Daniel Keohane, a senior researcher at the Center for Security Studies at Swiss university ETH Zurich. In the Middle East, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait have both in the past year begun mandatory military service for their young men. With only a small population, the UAE wants to bolster its defences amid growing regional uncertainty in countries such as Yemen and Syria. But conscription is also seen to promote a stronger sense of nationhood for the young country. As in most countries, those in the UAE can be excused from military service if they have certain medical conditions, like diabetes or epilepsy, or even flat feet, or you are the only male provider for their family. But there can be an upside to service. UAE law requires that Emiratis who are employed at the time of their call-up must have their position held for them and then should be prioritised for promotion when they return. For recruits, that could help soften the blow of having to suspend career ambitions for the sake of the country. Rising up the ranks  Doing military service can in some cases be a career boost, says Victoria Bethlehem, senior vice president for global talent acquisition, planning and development at recruitment giant Adecco Group. “Candidates learn useful skills and gain valuable experiences during national service that they can take with them into their careers and working lives,” she says. This was the attitude adopted by Londoner David Hubbard, who could have used his dual nationality and study plans to get out of doing Finnish national service. He decided instead to grasp the opportunity because he thought it would be “a talking point” and help him stand out when he applies for jobs after university. “Overall, it’s been an awesome experience,” the 19-year-old says. “It was tough to start with. I barely spoke any Finnish when I arrived and I didn’t always know what was going on, but it has got easier and I’ve certainly learned how to cope with tough situations better.” Pay to not play? Conscription in other countries is less pleasant and many young men – and their families – go to extreme lengths in order to dodge the draft. Young men in Russia are required to serve 12 months in the army for their national service. There are no official statistics for how many Russian men duck this duty, but it is believed as many as half avoid it through paying bribes or by staying on at university to pursue doctoral or other further studies. “Corruption is widespread in Russia and paying someone to get out of military service is very common and quite socially accepted,” says an analyst at the European Parliamentary Research Service, who asked not to be named. However, with Russia now engaged militarily in Syria and along its own national borders, there are new moves to crack down on draft dodging and improve the army’s image in order to attract more recruits. In Turkey, all young men, apart from those exempted on health grounds, or who are sole earners for their families, must do military service. But, money talks for those who’d rather not serve. In addition to the thriving business for doctors who are willing to write fake medical certificates, the government sometimes allows men to pay their way out, via temporary amnesty windows. Currently, for Turks who have been living, working or studying outside of the country for more than three years, there is an option to pay 1,000 euros ($1,096) for a full exemption. For those inside the country, when there is an option to pay, it is significantly higher – up to 18,000 Turkish lira ($5,813), enough to land someone in significant debt for years to come. Fail to report for military service when required and you will be summonsed to court and fined 100 lira ($32), with the penalty doubling with each appearance.  There is no exemption for conscientious objectors. Many Iranians also avoid conscription by living outside the country, says Potkin Azarmehr, a UK-based Iranian commentator and regime critic who left Iran as a child in 1976. Others pay their way out, though the amount – and even the option – to pay changes regularly and clear information is hard to come by. “It’s quite classist. Those with money can afford to go out and come back and pay, those who can’t must stay and do their service,” says Potkin. Others, he says, take a more novel approach. “I know of one guy who wanted to get out of it so badly that he took tablets to increase his appetite in order to put on weight. At the time being overweight was a way to be exempted. It worked, but he has been unable to lose the weight since. He adds: “Another person I know declared himself illiterate. Today he’s a successful businessman, but whenever his papers are checked it comes up that he didn’t do his service because of being illiterate, and it’s quite embarrassing for him.”"
geopolitical tensions,N Korea's Kim abandons unification goal with South,2024-09-15,2024-01-16,By Oliver Slow,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-67990948,"North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has said unification with the South is no longer possible, and that the constitution should be changed to designate it the ""principal enemy"".  Mr Kim also said three organisations dealing with reunification would shut down, state media KCNA reported.  South Korea's president said it would respond ""multiple times stronger"" to any provocation from the North.  The two Koreas have been divided since the Korean War ended in 1953.  They did not sign a peace treaty and therefore have remained technically still at war ever since. In a speech delivered at the Supreme People's Assembly - North Korea's rubber-stamp parliament - Mr Kim said that the constitution should be amended to educate North Koreans that South Korea is a ""primary foe and invariable principal enemy"".  He also said that if a war breaks out on the Korean peninsula, the country's constitution should reflect the issue of ""occupying"", ""recapturing"" and ""incorporating"" the South into its territory.  Mr Kim - who replaced his father, Kim Jong-il, as North Korean leader in 2011 - said the North ""did not want war, but we also have no intention of avoiding it"", according to KCNA.  He said he was taking a ""new stand"" on north-south relations, which included dismantling all organisations tasked with reunification. Speaking to his cabinet on Tuesday, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said that if the North carried out a provocation, the South ""will retaliate multiple times stronger"", pointing to the South Korean military's ""overwhelming response capabilities"".  Dr John Nilsson-Wright, who heads the Japan and Koreas Programme at Cambridge University's Centre for Geopolitics, described Mr Kim's remarks as ""unprecedented"", and said it was ""highly unusual"" for a North Korean leader to depart from the policy of unification. ""It's not unusual for relations between the North and South to cool, but this has taken the relationship in a different direction,"" he told the BBC. He added that Mr Kim's anti-Western stance can be traced back to the 2019 summit with then-US President Donald Trump in Vietnam, which ended without an agreement. ""This has been an acute disappointment and loss of face for Kim,"" Dr Nilsson-Wright said.  Mr Kim's comments came as relations significantly weakened on the Korean Peninsula in recent months.  In November, North Korea  fully suspended a five-year military deal with the South aimed at lowering military tensions. It promised to withdraw all measures ""taken to prevent military conflict in all spheres including ground, sea and air"", and said it would deploy more forces to the border region.  The South had partly suspended the agreement days earlier after Mr Kim claimed to have successfully launched a spy satellite into space.   The rhetoric - and provocative actions - from the North have only escalated since then.  At year-end policy meetings, Mr Kim said he needed to ""newly formulate"" the North's stance towards inter-Korean relations and reunification policy, adding that the stated goal was to ""make a decisive policy change"" related to ""the enemy"".  He also threatened a nuclear attack on the South, and called for a build-up of his country's military arsenal.  The North has also launched missiles in recent weeks, as well as live-fire exercises close to South Korean territory.  In a report published last week for 38 North, a US-based organisation with a focus on North Korea, former State Department official Robert Carlin and nuclear scientist Siegfried S Hecker said they saw the situation on the Korean Peninsula as ""more dangerous than it has ever been"" since the start of the Korean War in 1950.  ""That may sound overly dramatic, but we believe that, like his grandfather in 1950, Kim Jong Un has made a strategic decision to go to war,"" it said.  ""We do not know when or how Kim plans to pull the trigger, but the danger is already far beyond the routine warnings in Washington, Seoul and Tokyo about Pyongyang's 'provocations'.""  It added that it did not see the ""war preparation themes"" in North Korean media as ""typical bluster"".  Dr Nilsson-Wright agreed and said the ""risk of escalation should be taken seriously"".  Meanwhile North Korea's Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui is in Russia where she is expected to meet President Vladimir Putin.  The two countries have boosted ties recently, with both isolated by Western powers, and last September Mr Kim visited Russia where he met Mr Putin. "
geopolitical tensions,Explained: The conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh,2024-09-15,2023-09-19,By Michael Ertl,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66852070,"Tens of thousands of ethnic Armenians have fled from Nagorno-Karabakh since the territory surrendered to Azerbaijan on 20 September. Local forces in Karabakh agreed to be disarmed and disbanded after an Azerbaijani military offensive triggered intense fighting. The breakaway republic and its institutions will ""cease to exist"" from 1 January 2024, the region's separatist leader has said. The territory is recognised internationally as part of Azerbaijan but large areas of it have been controlled by ethnic Armenians for three decades. It is at the heart of one of the world's longest-running conflicts. The territory lies in the mountainous South Caucasus region between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea. Azerbaijan and Armenia fought a bloody war over Nagorno-Karabakh in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and it has been the trigger for further violence in the years since. The last major escalation in the conflict took place in 2020 when thousands of people were reported killed in six weeks of fierce fighting. The deployment of Russian peacekeepers brought the fighting to a halt at the time, but tensions had been ratcheting up for months ahead of the latest military operation. Fears of fresh violence rose when Azerbaijan mounted an effective blockade of a vital route into the enclave in December 2022. The Lachin Corridor is the only road that connects the Republic of Armenia to Nagorno-Karabakh. It is a key artery for supplies, and residents in the territory reported severe shortages of basic food items and medication during the blockade. Azerbaijan accused Armenia of using the road to bring in military supplies, which Armenia denied. Baku also said it had offered food and aid several times via another road but Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh refused it. Maintaining access through the Lachin Corridor and another route, the Aghdam Road from Azerbaijan, relied heavily on the presence of Russian peacekeepers deployed in the area since 2020. But Moscow's attention and military resources have been diverted by its invasion of Ukraine. The Armenian prime minister accused Russia of ""spontaneously leaving the region"". Karabakh authorities said at least 200 people had died in the fighting, while Azerbaijan said that 192 of its soldiers had been killed. Azerbaijan and the ethnic-Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh declared a ceasefire, mediated by Russia, on 20 September, which brought 24 hours of fighting to an end. The agreement said local Armenian forces would be completely disarmed and disbanded. Azerbaijan and the Karabakh authorities have since started talks about the integration of the enclave into Azerbaijan. But the territory's separatist leader, Samvel Shahramanyan, also signed an order dissolving all state institutions from next year, effectively ending the territory's struggle for independence. Mr Shahramanyan said the decision to dissolve the state was ""based on the priority of ensuring the physical security and vital interests of the people"", referencing Azerbaijan's agreement that ""free, voluntary and unhindered travel is ensured to residents"". Armenia said more than half of the estimated 120,000 ethnic Armenians fled the territory in the week after the ceasefire, fearing they would have no future in Nagorno-Karabakh. The Lachin Corridor was packed with hundreds of buses and cars of people trying to leave. Armenia's Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan has said he expects there will be no Armenians left in Nagorno-Karabakh in the near future. Azerbaijan has said it wants to integrate the region's population as ""equal citizens"" and dismissed allegations of ethnic cleansing levelled by Armenia. The country's president, Ilham Aliyev, also said that Azerbaijanis who were displaced from the region in the decades-long conflict should have the option of returning. The two countries have never signed a peace deal and despite negotiations over the years do not have formal diplomatic relations. Modern-day Armenia and Azerbaijan became part of the Soviet Union in the 1920s.  The area designated Nagorno-Karabakh had a majority ethnic-Armenian population but was controlled by Azerbaijan. Nagorno-Karabakh's regional parliament voted to become part of Armenia when the Soviet Union began to collapse in the late 1980s. Azerbaijan sought to suppress the separatist movement, while Armenia backed it.  This led to ethnic clashes and - after Armenia and Azerbaijan declared independence from Moscow - a full-scale war. Years of bloodshed and suffering followed. BBC Azerbaijani Service editor Konul Khalilova remembers how hundreds of thousands of ethnic Azerbaijanis were forced out of Armenia, becoming refugees in Azerbaijan.  In February 1992, residents of the Azerbaijani town Khojaly, situated in the Nagorno-Karabakh area, were killed by Armenian forces, helped by some of the Russian military. More than 600 people died, according to Azerbaijan. Armenia disputes the account and the number of deaths. Over the years, tens of thousands of people were killed and more than a million displaced amid reports of ethnic cleansing and massacres committed by both sides. Khalilova says it sometimes surprises her how little young people in both countries know about the atrocities.  No-one tells Armenians about the Azerbaijanis who were killed; likewise, young Azerbaijanis today do not hear about pogroms of the Armenian people in Azerbaijani cities such as Sumgayit and Baku at the end of the 1980s, she says.  Azerbaijan disputes the accounts of pogroms. The first Nagorno-Karabakh war ended with a Russian-brokered ceasefire in 1994, after Armenian forces had gained control of Nagorno-Karabakh and areas adjacent to it. Under the deal, Nagorno-Karabakh remained part of Azerbaijan, but since then it has mostly been governed by a separatist, self-declared republic, run by ethnic Armenians and backed by the Armenian government. The situation has been volatile ever since, with bouts of fighting interrupting periods of relative calm. The biggest military confrontation since the early 1990s happened three years ago during six weeks of heavy fighting. Azerbaijan won back territory and by the time both sides agreed to sign a Russian-brokered peace deal in November 2020, it had recaptured all the territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh held by Armenia since 1994. Under the agreement, Armenian forces had to withdraw from these areas and have since been confined to a smaller part of the region. Regional powers have been heavily involved in the conflict over the years. Turkey has close cultural and historical links to Azerbaijan. Turkish-made Bayraktar drones are said to have played a crucial role in the fighting in 2020, allowing Azerbaijan to make territorial gains. Armenia, on the other hand, traditionally had good relations with Russia. There is a Russian military base in Armenia, and both are members of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) military alliance of six former Soviet states. But relations between Armenia and Russia have soured since Nikol Pashinyan, who led huge anti-government protests in 2018, became Armenia's prime minister. He recently said Armenia's reliance on Russia as its single source for security was a ""strategic error"". Armenia held joint exercises with US forces earlier this month. Following the fighting in Nagorno-Karabakh, Mr Pashinyan criticised the role Russian peacekeepers had played and publicly questioned whether remaining a CSTO member was in Armenia's interest. Russia has rejected Mr Pashinyan's comments as ""unacceptable outbursts addressed against Russia [that] can spark nothing but rejection"". ""The leadership in Yerevan is making a big mistake by deliberately trying to destroy Armenia's multifaceted and centuries-old ties with Russia, and by holding the country hostage to the geopolitical games of the West,"" Russia's foreign ministry said. The Kremlin has also criticised ""extremely hostile"" moves by Armenia to join the International Criminal Court (ICC), which has issued an arrest warrant for President Vladimir Putin."
geopolitical tensions,The blogger jailed for visiting a country that 'doesn't exist',2024-09-15,2017-02-07,by Alex Dackevych,https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-38804499,"Alexander Lapshin holding his passports for Russia, Israel and Ukraine. A popular travel blogger known more for his wry observations than his political views has ended up in jail - and at the centre of a geopolitical row - after visiting a disputed territory and thumbing his nose at the authorities.  Alexander Lapshin writes the blog ""Life Adventures"", where he details his transport woes, his visits to odd and unusual sites, and his thoughts on the beauty of local women. His popular posts hosted on the website LiveJournal, external feature international politics considerably less often. But his latest trip has landed the 40-year-old Lapshin in a Belarusian jail, and politicians from four countries - including the Russian foreign minister and the President of Belarus - have weighed in on his case. At issue are Lapshin's repeated visits to the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh. It's internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan and is totally surrounded by other Azeri territory. However it's almost entirely populated by ethnic Armenians and has been a consistent cause of Armenian-Azeri tensions.  A series of bloody conflicts over Nagorno-Karabakh flared up after the breakup of the Soviet Union, and while an official ceasefire has been in place since 1994, this has been consistently violated, including an outbreak of hostilities in 2016.   Lapshin's involvement began when he visited Nagorno-Karabakh in 2011 and 2012 and subsequently wrote about those visits in his blog. Azeri prosecutors accuse him of entering the territory illegally and as a result he was banned from visiting Azerbaijan.  Despite this he travelled to Azerbaijan in 2016, this time using a different passport. He holds Russian, Israeli and Ukrainian travel documents, and his Ukrainian passport has a slightly different spelling of his name, which apparently allowed him to bypass the ban. Visit the Trending Facebook page, external Azeri authorities also say that Lapshin has called for the region's independence in his blog posts - a claim that is difficult to verify because many of the relevant posts were deleted following his arrest. Under Azeri law, calling for changes to the ""territorial integrity"" of the country is illegal.  Azerbaijan issued an arrest warrant for Lapshin due to his travels and blog posts, and he was arrested in mid-December while on a visit to Minsk. The Azeri government then asked for Lapshin to be extradited from Belarus to stand trial, and he faces up to 13 years in jail if convicted on all the charges against him.  Although most of Lapshin's original posts discussing Nagorno-Karabakh have now been deleted, one repost of an entry he wrote in April 2016 still exists on another blog.  In it, he declared himself neutral in the dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan but was critical of the Azeri government and media. ""Reading their media gives the impression that the Azerbaijani authorities and journalists believe their own people to be morons,"" he wrote. ""The Azerbaijani army is incapable of storming Karabakh for both strategic and political reasons. If they could do it - they would have done so a long time ago, as 23 years is enough time."" Alexander Lapshin's name was placed on an official government blacklist after his visits to Nagorno-Karabakh in 2011 and 2012. Russia and Israel have weighed in on the issue, calling on Lapshin to be released.  At a press conference in January, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said: ""Russia is opposed to the criminalization of visits by journalists or other people to this territory or other territories in different regions. Moscow disagrees with the extradition to a third country of Russians detained abroad."" Nevertheless, the extradition request has continued to wind its way through the Belarusian courts, and Lapshin remains in jail in Minsk.  Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has told law enforcement agencies that they should honour the  request. At a press conference on Friday he told reporters, external: ""He [Lapshin] was detained in accordance with an Interpol decision, and according to the law we have to pass him to Azerbaijan."" He added: ""Of course we could release him, but it would be wrong."" Israeli MP Ksenia Svetlova has also been working for the blogger's release. She persuaded Lapshin to write a letter of apology to the Azeri authorities, who were unmoved.  ""They [Lapshin's family] are waiting for some kind of response from the Azeris,"" Svetlova told BBC Trending.  Svetlova has also asked for guarantees that, in the event of extradition, Lapshin is immediately released if he is extradited to Azerbaijan. A map on Lapshin's blog shows all of the countries (in green) that he has visited In the meantime, Lapshin's wife Ekaterina has taken over his blog and Facebook account. Ekaterina Lapshin says that she was allowed a one-hour visit in December but has since been denied access to her husband. She recently wrote on Facebook: ""Apparently I won't [be allowed a visit]. 15 days have passed since my request was made and I am not allowed. This is what the prosecutor told me.""  She's also used Facebook to express concerns about the standard of the prison that Lapshin is being kept in.  ""It's seriously cold… -29 to - 30 in Minsk yesterday,"" she wrote in January. ""This is especially felt in the cell where (Alexander) is held."" Lapshin also has the backing of his fans and many others organising on Russian language social media. On VKontakte, a a change.org petition titled ""Freedom of Journalist Alexander Lapshin"" has been circulating. And the Armenian National Committee, an organisation of Armenian-Americans, has organised protests outside Belarusian consulates in New York and Washington. Armenian National Committee protest outside the Belarusian Embassy in Washington Lapshin is now awaiting a final decision from the Supreme Court of Belarus in the next few days. If his latest appeal is rejected, it will almost certainly mean extradition to Azerbaijan.

geopolitical tensions,Lower cost of tea eases January price rises,2024-09-15,2024-01-30,By Faarea Masud & Michael Race,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68135054,"Shop prices rose at their slowest rate in more than 18 months in January, according to the latest report from the British Retail Consortium (BRC). Inflation - the rate at which prices rise - has reached near-record highs in recent times, prompting a cost-of-living crisis. However, discounts and lower prices for milk and tea saw shop price inflation fall to 2.9%, from 4% in December. Overall, prices are still going up in the shops but at a slower rate. On average, food prices are still rising by more than 6% a year. The BRC, which represents some of the UK's biggest retailers, said shop price inflation in January was at its lowest level since May 2022. Discounts after New Year also helped to slow down the rate of price increases for non-food products, which eased to 1.3%, down from 3.1% the month before. However, the BRC warned in its report that many households had not felt the benefit of lower inflation, adding there were risks that price rises could accelerate once more.  Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the BRC, said progress in slowing price rises was likely to be hampered by other cost pressures, including implementing the increase in the National Living Wage, and an increase in business rates in April. ""Rising geopolitical tensions will also add to uncertainty and costs in supply chains. With a general election later this year, we want to see political parties outline how they will help unlock investment across the country, rather than the current trajectory, which is doing just the opposite,"" Ms Dickinson said. Separate data from research company Kantar said food price inflation fell at a slower rate in January due to fewer people buying promotional items compared with December. It said some 86 million more lunchboxes were taken to work or school in 2023 as people sought to manage budgets more closely. ""As consumers across the country took on Dry January, spending on alcohol fell by more than half compared with December, said Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar. Almost 6% of beer packs sold in January were no or low-alcohol options, marking a jump from 4% at the end of last year. Sales of own-label plant-based ranges increased by 8% on the month as Veganuary got under way, Kantar said. Some analysts fear inflation will stay elevated, following attacks on ships using a vital trade route through the Red Sea. Several shipping firms have stopped vessels using the route after the attacks by Houthi rebels in Yemen. Last week, the US and UK launched military strikes against the Houthis. But Mr McKevitt said: ""There's been a lot of speculation about the impact the Red Sea shipping crisis might have on the cost of goods, but the story in the grocery aisles this January is more about the battle between the supermarkets to offer best value, rather than geopolitics.  ""Retailers have taken their foot off the promotions gas slightly as we've come into the New Year, and that's meant inflation hasn't fallen as quickly."" He added attention would now turn to Valentine's Day to see if couples opt for more low-key celebrations again, like they did in 2023. However, although tobacco and alcohol prices remain high, there is some hope that headline inflation could fall to nearer the Bank of England's 2% target as energy bills are predicted to come down in 2024.  The predicted fall in the inflation rate has fuelled hopes that the Bank will cut its key interest rate, which currently stands at a 15-year high.  The Bank has increased interest rates 14 times since December 2021 in an attempt to tackle inflation, which has strained the finances of UK households over the past two years.

geopolitical tensions,Taiwan unveils new submarine to fend off China,2024-09-15,2023-09-28,By Tessa Wong,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-66932808,"Taiwan has unveiled its first domestically-made submarine as it bolsters its defences against a possible Chinese attack. President Tsai Ing-wen presided over the launch ceremony in the port city of Kaohsiung on Thursday. US officials have warned that China could be militarily capable of mounting an invasion within the next few years. Taiwan is a self-governing island which China regards as a renegade province and has vowed to reclaim one day. Most observers believe China will not attack the island imminently, and Beijing has said it seeks peaceful ""reunification"" with Taiwan. But at the same time it has warned against Taiwan formally declaring independence and any foreign support. It has increasingly sought to put pressure on the island with its military drills in the Taiwan Strait, including several conducted this month.   ""History will forever remember this day,"" said Ms Tsai as she stood in front of the towering submarine draped in the emblem of Taiwan's flag.  She added that the idea of a domestically-made submarine had previously been considered ""an impossible task… but we did it"".  Building their own submarines has long been a key priority for Taiwan's leaders, but the programme accelerated under Ms Tsai who has revved up military spending to nearly double its budget during her tenure. The $1.54bn (£1.27bn) diesel-electric powered submarine will undergo several tests and will be delivered to the navy by the end of 2024, according to military officials.  It has been named the Haikun after a mythical massive fish that can also fly, which appears in classic Chinese literature. Another one is currently in production. Taiwan aims to eventually operate a fleet of 10 submarines - including two older Dutch-made boats - and equip them with missiles. The head of the domestic submarine programme Admiral Huang Shu-kuang told reporters last week that the goal was to fend off any attempt from China to encircle Taiwan for an invasion or impose a naval blockade. It would also buy time until US and Japan forces arrive to aid Taiwan's defence, he added.  When asked by reporters about the submarine on Thursday, a Chinese defence ministry spokesperson said it was ""idiotic nonsense"" to try to stop their military's actions in the Pacific. ""No amount of weapons [Taiwan's ruling] Democratic Progressive Party buys or makes can stop reunification with the motherland,"" he added. In a piece published earlier this week, state media outlet Global Times said Taiwan was ""daydreaming"" and the plan was ""just an illusion"".   It also claimed China's military ""has already constructed a multidimensional anti-submarine network all around the island"". Observers agree that the new submarines could help boost Taiwan's defence. Taiwan's 10-submarine fleet would pale in comparison to China's, said to currently comprise more than 60 boats including nuclear-powered attack submarines, with more on the way. But the island has long pursued an asymmetric warfare strategy where it aims to build a more agile defence force to face down a larger and well-resourced enemy. The submarines could ""aid Taiwan's relatively small navy in taking initiative against China's mighty navy"" by conducting ""guerrilla style warfare with their stealth, lethality and surprise capabilities"", noted William Chung, a military researcher with the Institute for National Defense and Security Research in Taiwan. In particular, he said, they could help guard the various straits and channels that link the so-called ""first island chain"", a network of islands including Taiwan, Philippines and Japan seen as a possible battlefront for any conflict with China. Anti-submarine warfare remains the Chinese navy's ""weakest part, and this is the chance for Taiwan to exploit it"", he added. But the ""centre of gravity"" for any China-Taiwan naval conflict would not likely be in the deep waters off the island's east coast, where submarines would be most effective in, pointed out Drew Thompson, a visiting senior research fellow at the National University of Singapore and former US Department of Defense official.  Instead, the main theatre of war would be in the shallower waters of the west coast facing mainland China.  ""The submarine is not optimised for a counter invasion role... having this increased capability to complicate China's military operations would have an effect, but it's not a decisive one,"" he said. Their effectiveness would largely depend on how Taiwan chooses to deploy them.  Beyond playing a deterrent role they could also be used to ambush Chinese ships; carry out mine-laying operations in Chinese ports; disrupt maritime oil supplies; and destroy key facilities on the Chinese coastline, according to Chieh Chung, a defence researcher with Taiwanese think tank National Policy Foundation. What is more significant, however, is that Taiwan managed to design and build its own submarine in the first place. The Haikun uses a combat system by US defence company Lockheed Martin and will carry US-made torpedoes. While this may be no surprise given that the US is Taiwan's chief ally, at least six other countries including the UK came to Taiwan's aid in supplying components, technology and talent, according to a Reuters report. Adm Huang told Nikkei Asia he had personally approached military contacts in the US, Japan, South Korea and India for help but did not specify which country eventually agreed. The fact that several countries and companies were ""not afraid to supply parts to a marquee defence programme in Taiwan... indicates a significant geopolitical shift"", noted Mr Thompson. It is an indicator of the ""doubt and dissatisfaction"" with Beijing felt by some members of the international community, and ""should cause China to feel disquiet"", added Mr Chieh.  The launch comes a day after Beijing confirmed it had been conducting military drills this month to ""resolutely combat the arrogance of Taiwan independence separatist forces"". In recent weeks it had once again ramped up its warship presence in the Taiwan Strait and military jet incursions into airspace around the island.  US military and intelligence officials have given varying timelines for a possible Chinese invasion.  One date put forth recently is 2027 - Chinese President Xi Jinping is believed to have told his military to be operationally capable of mounting an invasion by that year. But CIA director William Burns also said it did not necessarily mean Mr Xi would decide to invade then as he is thought to have doubts over whether China would succeed."
geopolitical tensions,Taiwan votes in local elections amid China tensions,2024-09-15,2022-11-26,By Frances Mao,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-63739622,"Millions in Taiwan are heading to the polls as the island's local midterm elections kick off on Saturday.  Local council and city mayors are elected in the polls, which are held every four years.   But these elections are also drawing global attention this year as Taiwan becomes a bigger geopolitical flashpoint between China and the US. The Chinese government sees Taiwan as a breakaway province that will, eventually, be part of the country. But many Taiwanese people consider their self-ruled island - with its own form of government and a democratic system - to be distinct. This election also involves a referendum to lower the voting age to 18. Currently, only people above the age of 20 can vote. But more and more younger people appear to be becoming politically conscious, with turnout at the 2020 vote being the highest ever.  Young people have told the BBC they're directly being driven by the ""China threat"" - an issue that has been a big part of the political conversation throughout their lives.  There are two main political parties in Taiwan and they have differing approaches to China.  The Kuomintang (KMT), a party of conservative business champions, are traditionally seen as pro-China ""doves"". They have advocated for economic engagement with China and have appeared to be in favour of unification, though they have strongly denied being pro-China. Their main rival is the governing Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) whose leader Tsai Ing-wen won by a landslide in the 2020 national election. Ms Tsai has taken a strong stance towards China, saying Beijing needed to show Taiwan respect and that Taipei would not bow to pressure.   She was re-elected in 2020 on a promise to stand up to Beijing. Locals told the BBC at the time that protests in Hong Kong and Beijing's subsequent crackdown on civil rights had raised concerns in Taiwan.  ""The DPP is experiencing diminishing returns to its traditional brand of Taiwanese nationalism,"" says Wen-ti Sung, a Taiwan politics analyst in Taipei who works for the Australian National University. He says this year was full of national security events that should have been favourable to the DPP's ""rallying around the flag"" sentiment.  Those national security events refer to US House speaker Nancy Pelosi's controversial visit to Taiwan and China's massive military drills in response, the war in Ukraine and Chinese President Xi Jinping's commitment to make progress on cross-strait relations. ""Yet virtually all the polls indicate the DPP [is] failing to translate heightened nationalist sentiment into electoral support, unlike its big wins after the 2014 Sunflower Movement and 2020 presidential election post-Hong Kong crisis,"" he said. The government has claimed, ahead of the vote, that election meddling and interference from China was less than previously recorded. Taiwan has accused China of repeated efforts to influence voters - through online misinformation campaigns, military threats and even offering cheap flights to Taiwanese living in China. But Foreign Minister Joseph Wu said Chinese interference ""was not as prevailing as [in] previous elections"". He noted that Beijing might simply be ""very busy in dealing with its own domestic problems"", referring to China's soaring Covid cases. According to the polls, the mayoral race is quite close in Taipei and Hsinchu, Taiwan's Silicon Valley which is home to the country's world-leading semiconductor and microchip businesses. The races to watch out for are in six major cities, where 75% of the population live. In Taipei, the KMT's candidate is a man who says he's the great grand-son of Chiang Kai-shek, who ruled Taiwan for several decades in the 20th century. The family has rejected the claim but analysts point out that the KMT have often alluded to the link in their campaign. Hsinchu is also considered a bellwether, Dr Sung says. It's a three-way race for the mayorship, with the KMT and DPP candidates being challenged by a technocrat who is backed by the Taiwan People's Party and Terry Gou, the founder of technology manufacturing giant Foxconn.  The incumbent DPP sees winning Hsinchu as critical to maintaining its electoral support in northern Taiwan."
geopolitical tensions,The three men vying to be Taiwan's next president,2024-09-15,2024-01-04,By Kelly Ng,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-67758997,"On 13 January, Taiwan will elect a new president in a critical race that could redefine the island's relationship with China.  Beijing has long claimed self-governed Taiwan as a breakaway province and has loomed over the island's elections since the first one in 1996.  This year's race to replace sitting President Tsai Ing-wen is happening at a time when Taiwan has emerged as a key flashpoint between the US and China. Geopolitics aside, low wages and soaring home prices are among the domestic challenges weighing on voters.  On the ballot are the current vice-president from the governing Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), a former police chief who is running on the main opposition party Kuomintang or KMT's ticket, and an ex-Taipei mayor. The legislative elections, where each voter will cast one ballot for their district and another for at-large seats, will run on the same day. Here's more on the three presidential hopefuls and their running mates. He may be soft spoken, but Taiwan's 64-year-old vice-president is a staunch defender of the island's self-governing status - with China's state-run Global Times even calling for him to be prosecuted under Beijing's anti-secession laws.  During his tenure as President Tsai's premier from 2017 to 2019, Mr Lai described himself as a ""pragmatic worker for Taiwanese independence"".  Mr Lai's father died in an accident when he was two. Watching his mother raise six children by herself fostered a strong work ethic in Mr Lai, he says. He was medically trained in Harvard and worked as a renal doctor before he entered public service in Taiwan in the mid-1990s.  He first served as a lawmaker representing the southern city of Tainan. He was elected the city's mayor in 2010 and held on to the post in 2014 with an unprecedented 73% of the vote.  In his presidential campaign, Mr Lai has repeatedly said that Taiwan hopes to ""be friends"" with China. ""We don't want to be enemies. We can be friends. And we [would] love to see China... enjoy democracy and freedom, just like us,"" he told Bloomberg in August. Beijing, in turn, has called Mr Lai a ""troublemaker through and through"". But his running mate, Hsiao Bi-khim, appears to infuriate Beijing even more. She was born in Japan and mostly grew up in the US, cementing her links to Taiwan's strongest allies, which are also China's toughest diplomatic relationships. China has called Ms Hsiao a ""diehard Taiwan independence separatist"". Beijing has twice sanctioned the high-profile diplomat from entering mainland China and has also prohibited investors and firms related to her from working with organisations on the mainland. Ms Hsiao brings a wealth of foreign policy experience to Mr Lai's ticket. The 52-year-old served as Taiwan's representative to the US for the last three years. She was the first woman to take on this role. When it comes to statecraft, she calls herself a ""cat warrior"" - a retort to the combative ""wolf warrior"" style of diplomacy that Beijing encouraged until recently. ""Cats are much more lovable than wolves. In diplomacy, it's about making friends,"" she told The Economist last month. ""It's about making yourselves lovable."" As a child, Mr Hou supported his family's business by catching pigs or helping out at their pork stall in a local market. The 66-year-old once said the skills he developed while taking on pigs helped build his career as a policeman. He helped arrest high-profile murderers and was also a key investigator in the assassination attempt on ex-president Chen Shui-bian in 2004.  The former police chief turned to politics in 2010 and became mayor of New Taipei, Taiwan's most populous city, in 2018. He was re-elected in a landslide in 2022. Mr Hou's track record as a competent policeman and a popular mayor made him the KMT's top pick as it seeks to reclaim Taiwan's leadership after eight years. Mr Hou  had attempted to mount a joint ticket with another opposition candidate, Ko Wen-je, but that failed.  Mr Hou opposes Taiwan independence but has largely avoided voicing his stance on China in this campaign. This lack of clarity has drawn criticism. He dodged a question on the ""One-China"" policy - which recognises only one Chinese government, in Beijing - at a university forum in June 2023, calling into question his ability to manage dicey diplomacy. ""The relationship between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait is clear. We don't need to get it confused… It is completely based on the constitution of the Republic of China,"" he said then.  The KMT's vice-presidential nominee Jaw Shaw-kong is a well-known political commentator and one-time leader of the right-wing New Party. The 73-year-old is a long-time and outspoken supporter of the ""reunification"" of Taiwan and China - although he recently said this is not something he would pursue if elected given the substantial differences between the two sides. In 1991, Mr Jaw was appointed by the KMT-led government to serve as environment minister. Two years later, he co-founded the pro-unification New Party, which broke away from the KMT because its founders thought the KMT was not sufficiently pro-China. Mr Jaw withdrew from politics in 1996 and turned to a career in media. He is best-known for hosting a political talk show, aired by mainland-friendly broadcaster TVBS. In February 2021, Mr Jaw returned to politics. The quirky doctor-turned-politician - who once released a trippy rap video during his Taipei mayorship urging residents to ""do things right"" - brands himself as a ""third choice"" for voters between provoking and deferring to China.  Head of the Taiwan People's Party (TPP), Ko Wen-je proved popular among young voters. Once a prominent trauma surgeon, Mr Ko gave up his white coat for politics 10 years ago. The 64-year-old shot to political fame after throwing his support behind the ""Sunflower Movement"" in 2014, when students led protests against what they saw as China's growing influence over the island. Later that year, he was elected the mayor of Taipei. Despite being a political novice, he scored endorsements from Sunflower Movement activists and the DPP. Mr Ko's politics shifted during his eight-year mayorship. He expanded Taipei's relationship with mainland China, particularly with Shanghai's city government.  In 2019, he formed the TPP, branding it as the alternative to the DPP and KMT. The TPP won five out of 113 seats in the 2020 elections, making it the third-largest party in Taiwan's parliament. Known for his pithy style, Mr Ko has accused the DPP of endangering Taiwan by being ""pro-war"", while criticising the KMT for being ""too deferential"".  Mr Ko's running mate Cynthia Wu is a sitting MP and heiress to one of Taiwan's largest conglomerates, the Shin Kong Group. Some believe Ms Wu was picked because of her wealth. Born and educated in the US, the 45-year-old began her career as an investment analyst at Merrill Lynch in London before moving back to join the family business. She is currently the chief executive officer of the group's philanthropic arm. Analysts say both Mr Ko and Ms Wu are perceived as rich members of the elite and may face challenges connecting with the broader electorate, which is also voting on jobs and the economy."
geopolitical tensions,The White House revolving door: Who's gone?,2024-09-15,2017-05-10,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-39826934,"On Mr Trump's reality TV show, his catchphrase was ""You're fired!"" Donald Trump's old catchphrase was ""you're fired"" - and while he has been president, his senior team has had a very high turnover. Here is a run-down of what they did, and why they left, starting with the most recent. William Barr will step down on 23 December, President Trump said Mr Barr, 70, came out of semi-retirement in 2019 to replace Jeff Sessions for the cabinet role. During his lengthy legal career, he also served as attorney general under President George HW Bush in the early 1990s. Democratic critics of Mr Barr accused him of shielding his ex-boss from justice.  But despite his support for the president, Trump and many of his supporters turned on Mr Barr over his unwillingness to support the president's election lawsuits. His resignation comes into effect on 23 December - less than a month before his term is due to end, when President Trump leaves office. Tensions flared between the two after Mr Barr said there was no evidence of widespread fraud in November's election. He was also criticised by the president for not publicly disclosing during the race that his justice department was investigating Joe Biden's son Hunter. Mr Barr's resignation letter to President Trump began by saying he ""appreciated the opportunity to update"" the president on the Department of Justice's review of voter fraud allegations in the recent election and ""how these allegations will continue to be pursued"". One year, ten months A former Microsoft executive, Mr Krebs had led the agency since its inception in 2018 in the aftermath of alleged Russian interference in 2016's presidential elections. As director he was responsible for improving cybersecurity across all levels of government, and safeguarding the security of the 2020 elections. Mr Krebs had been praised by both Democrats and Republicans for his handling of the latest election. But he reportedly incurred the White House's displeasure over a Cisa website called Rumor Control, external, which debunked election misinformation, much of it amplified by the president himself. Hours before he was fired, he posted a tweet that appeared to take aim at Mr Trump's allegation that voting machines in various states had switched ballots to Mr Biden.  President Trump said he ""terminated"" Mr Krebs for ""highly inaccurate"" remarks on voting integrity. Two years. Mark Esper was appointed in 2019. He replaced an acting secretary of defence who was standing in after James Mattis left in 2018 over differences with Donald Trump on Syria, among other things. Mr Esper's relations with the president turned out to be equally rocky, towards the end at least. He was ""terminated"" in the post in a tweet from Mr Trump, who announced the director of the National Counterterrorism Center, Christopher Miller, was replacing him. The secretary disagreed with the president on a number of issues, most publicly on the use of active-duty military forces to quell street protests. Mr Esper was also far more conciliatory towards Nato than Mr Trump. Mr Esper had reportedly been preparing to resign - or to be sacked - since the president's election defeat. Just short of 17 months. Mrs Conway served as Donald Trump's campaign manager in the three months up to his election in November 2016.  She then became senior counsellor at the White House, and one of the president's closest advisers. She became noted for her colourful and high-profile defences of the president, and her sparring with journalists. She said she wanted to spend more time focusing on her children. Her decision to step down came hours after one of her daughters, Claudia, tweeted that her mother's job had ""ruined [her] life"" - a message that later went viral. Among Mrs Conway's many colourful lines, one of the most famous was ""alternative facts"", the phrase she used to describe then White House press secretary Sean Spicer's highly questioned figures about the number of people attending Mr Trump's inauguration. Four years, first as election campaign manager, then senior adviser. Mr Parscale served as digital media director for Mr Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. The 44-year-old was promoted to campaign manager for the president's 2020 re-election bid in February 2018. He has been a warm-up act for Mr Trump at rallies. Mr Parscale has reportedly been blamed by the US president's inner circle for a poorly attended rally in Oklahoma in June.  He boasted that more than one million people registered to attend the event, but the local fire department said fewer than 6,200 showed up. Mr Parscale blamed a blocked security gate, protesters and the media for the disappointing turnout. Mr Trump announced on social media that Mr Parscale was being replaced by Bill Stepien, a former aide to ex-New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. The president did not offer any reasons for the decision and praised Mr Parscale's work on digital and data strategies. Two years, five months. Mr Parscale is still working as a senior advisor to the Trump campaign. Mr Mulvaney assumed the role of acting White House chief of staff in January 2019. He previously served as director of the Office of Management and Budget. Despite his key White House roles, he was never part of the Trump inner circle. My Mulvaney's departure had been long rumoured and followed some high-profile slip-ups. Most notably, he was perceived to have implicated the president in the impeachment inquiry in an off-the-cuff remark at the White House podium, in which he shrugged off criticism over an alleged corrupt deal with Ukraine by saying: ""We do that all the time."" Mr Trump was reportedly outraged by the gaffe. In a written statement, Mr Mulvaney said: ""Let me be clear, there was absolutely no quid pro quo between Ukrainian military aid and any investigation into the 2016 election."" Mr Trump announced on 6 March that Mr Mulvaney was being replaced by North Carolina lawmaker Mark Meadows. One year, two months. Mr Mulvaney is now working as US special envoy to Northern Ireland. Mr Sondland was appointed as US ambassador to the European Union in June 2018. Before entering into politics, he was best known as a multi-millionaire hotelier.  He originally backed a Trump rival in the 2016 presidential race, but when Mr Trump was elected, he donated $1m (£781,000) to his inaugural committee. Mr Sondland was fired after testifying against Mr Trump in the impeachment proceedings. In his testimony, he accused the president of seeking a ""quid pro quo"" with Ukraine. On 7 February, Mr Sondland said he had been advised that the president intended ""to recall [him] effective immediately"". In a statement issued by his lawyer, he said: ""I am grateful to President Trump for having given me the opportunity to serve, to Secretary [of State Mike] Pompeo for his consistent support, and to the exceptional and dedicated professionals at the US mission to the European Union."" Just over one and a half years. Lt Col Alexander Vindman is a decorated Iraq war veteran who served as the top Ukraine expert on the National Security Council. He was born in Ukraine, then a Soviet republic, and moved to the US with his family when he and his twin brother, Yevgeny, were aged three. Lt Col Vindman's lawyer said he was fired after testifying as a witness in Mr Trump's impeachment case. His lawyer said he was escorted from the White House, while his twin brother, a senior lawyer for the National Security Council, was also sent back to the Department of the Army. During the impeachment proceedings, Lt Col Vindman described a phone call between Mr Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart as ""improper"" and said it had left him in ""shock"". Mr Trump defended the decision to fire him, describing the Ukraine expert as ""very insubordinate"". He said Lt Col Vindman had incorrectly reported the contents of a ""perfect"" phone call. One year, seven months. Lt Col Vindman announced in July that he had retired from the military after 21 years of service because his future would be ""forever limited"". His lawyer said the 45-year-old had been the victim of a ""campaign of bullying, intimidation and retaliation"" by the president. Mr Spencer, a former Marines pilot-turned-investment banker, was sworn in as the 76th secretary of the US Navy in August 2017.  During his time in the post, he also performed stints as acting secretary of defence and deputy secretary of defence. US Defence Secretary Mark Esper said he asked Mr Spencer to resign over ""his lack of candour"" regarding the case of a Navy Seal convicted of posing with a corpse while serving in Iraq.  The case of Edward Gallagher has sparked tensions between US President Donald Trump and military officials. The president reinstated Chief Petty Officer Gallagher's rank after he was demoted following his conviction, and later hit out at plans to hold a disciplinary review that could have resulted in him being stripped of his Seals membership. In a statement announcing the firing, Mr Esper alleged Mr Spencer had proposed a deal with the White House behind his back to resolve the case.  Mr Trump, however, said he was not happy with ""cost overruns"" and how Gallagher's trial was run, and suggested this was why Mr Spencer was fired. In his resignation letter, Mr Spencer said it was apparent that he and Mr Trump did not have the same view of ""good order and discipline"". ""I cannot in good conscience obey an order that I believe violates the sacred oath I took,"" he wrote.  Two years, three months.  Before joining the cabinet, Mr McAleenan worked as commissioner of US Customs and Border Protection. He oversaw the president's tough policies aimed at curbing immigration across the Mexican border. In a tweet, President Donald Trump said Mr McAleenan wanted to ""spend more time with his family and go into the private sector."" During his tenure, analysts described a turbulent relationship between the two.  Mr McAleenan has also criticised the ""uncomfortable"" tone of debate about immigration in America. Six months Mr Bolton assumed the post in April 2018, becoming Mr Trump's third national security adviser after Michael Flynn and HR McMaster. At that time, the president's decision to appoint Mr Bolton came as a surprise. He remained an unapologetic cheerleader of the 2003 Iraq war, which the US president himself once lambasted as ""a big mistake"". Mr Bolton was praised, however, by conservative admirers as a straight-talking foreign policy ""hawk"".  Mr Trump announced Mr Bolton's departure in a tweet, writing that his national security adviser's services were ""no longer needed"". But Mr Bolton quickly fired back, writing on Twitter that he had actually offered his resignation, but Mr Trump had told him ""let's talk about it tomorrow"". Mr Bolton's exit follows an argument with Mr Trump over the administration's peace talks with the Taliban. White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham told reporters: ""[The president] didn't like a lot of his policies, they disagree."" According to White House sources, the National Security Council - which advises the president - had become a separate entity during Mr Bolton's tenure.  A former senior Trump administration official, who wished to remain anonymous, told the BBC that Mr Bolton did not attend meetings, and followed his own initiatives. ""He's running his own show,"" said the official. One year, four months. Just a few days after his departure, Mr Bolton resumed his former job as the head of two political action committees: the John Bolton PAC and John Bolton Super PAC. So-called PACs promote the views of their members on selected issues, and have become an important tool for funnelling large funds into the political process and influencing elections. Mr Bolton released a book in June 2020 - The Room Where it Happened -about his time in the White House. In it, he paints a picture of a president ignorant of basic geopolitical facts and whose decisions were frequently driven by a desire for re-election. The White House had sought to block the book's release citing national security concerns. Read more: Ten biggest claims in John Bolton's Donald Trump book As director of national intelligence, Mr Coats oversaw all 17 US intelligence agencies, including the CIA and NSA. His office also had the authority to receive whistleblower complaints and decide if they should be referred to Congress. But Mr Coats' assessments were routinely contradicted by President Trump, who has been critical of the US intelligence community. In January, the president called his intelligence chiefs passive and naive in their assessment of the threat posed by Iran. On 28 July, President Donald Trump tweeted Mr Coats would step down in mid-August and Texas congressman John Ratcliffe would be nominated to replace him. In his resignation letter to the president, Mr Coats said America's intelligence community had become ""stronger than ever"" during his two-and-half-year tenure. ""As a result, I now believe it is time for me to move on to the next chapter of my life,"" he wrote. Mr Coats, a former senator and diplomat, said in February the president had asked him to stay in the post, yet their differences on foreign policy appeared irreconcilable at times. But the timing of his removal has been questioned by critics. The announcement came three days after a phone call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, which was the subject of a whistleblower complaint. The White House released a rough transcript of the call which shows Mr Trump asked Mr Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden, a Democratic frontrunner for the 2020 presidential elections. Two and a half years. Mr Acosta, a former federal prosecutor, was sworn in as Secretary in April 2017 - the first Hispanic appointee to the Cabinet. He was chosen for the role after Mr Trump's first choice, fast-food billionaire Andrew Puzder, withdrew. During his tenure, Mr Acosta oversaw initiatives to expand on promote workplace apprenticeships. But he was criticised for proposing massive cuts to the International Labor Affairs Bureau, a section of the department that combats human trafficking, child labour and forced labour. Mr Acosta had been defending his role in a 2008 plea deal that saw a light sentence for financier Jeffrey Epstein after he pleaded guilty to prostitution charges. Epstein was charged in July with new sex trafficking charges related to that case. Top Democrats had called on Mr Acosta to resign for engaging in ""an unconscionable agreement"" with Epstein. Mr Acosta said he negotiated the deal to ensure Epstein did not walk free, and that he was happy about the new case moving forward. While announcing his resignation, the former US attorney from Florida said he felt the ""right thing was to step aside"" so his past controversies would not overshadow the administration's accomplishments.  Mr Trump, who stood next to Mr Acosta while he spoke to reporters, noted: ""This was him, not me."" He said Mr Acosta was ""a great Labour Secretary"". Just over two years. Ms Sanders started out as deputy press secretary before replacing Sean Spicer in the top post - the third woman to ever hold the White House role.  While Press Secretary, she was accused of lying to journalists and frequently criticised the media for spreading ""fake news"" about the Trump administration.  Press briefings also became increasingly rare during her tenure as Mr Trump took charge of his own messaging. Mrs Sanders hosted fewer news conferences than any of the preceding 13 press secretaries, according to the American Presidency Project. Exact reasons are unclear, but President Trump announced her resignation on Twitter and lauded her as a ""warrior"". During her resignation speech, Ms Sanders said her role had been ""the honour of a lifetime"". Nearly two years. Ms Sanders is a regular contributor on television news channel Fox News, and is active among conservative groups. Rod Rosenstein eventually submitted a resignation letter, effective from 11 May, after months of rumours about his departure. It came shortly after the release of the report into claims of Russian interference in the 2016 election - an investigation he oversaw. Reports say he specially timed his departure to allow for Robert Mueller's probe to wind down first.  His relationship with the president was always publicly fraught - with the lawyer frequently coming under fire on Mr Trump's Twitter feed. There were even reports in 2018 that Mr Rosenstein at one point planned to secretly record the president in order to justify his removal under the 25th amendment of the US constitution. Despite this, Mr Rosenstein's resignation letter paid tribute to Mr Trump. In it, Rosenstein said he was ""grateful"" for the opportunity to serve under him and even signed it off borrowing his campaign slogan of ""America first"". Just over two years from his confirmation. Kirstjen Nielsen became Homeland Security Secretary in December 2017. Her sprawling department, responsible for domestic security, covers everything from borders to responding to national emergencies.  She faced criticism for enforcing some of the most controversial elements of President Trump's domestic agenda, such as the separation of children from their migrant parents at the Mexican border. In a resignation letter she said it was the ""right time for me to step aside"". There have been tensions between her and the president for months, who blamed her for a rise in migrants at the Mexican border. Days earlier President Trump withdrew his nominee to lead another key department dealing with immigration, saying he wanted to go in a ""tougher direction"". It is widely thought he wants someone ""tougher"" at Homeland Security too.  16 months. Six months after her resignation, the White House announced that she would be rejoining the Homeland Security department as a member of its National Infrastructure Advisory Council.  In June 2020, the Australian government announced that it had hired her to help prepare a cyber security strategy. Brock Long was appointed administrator of the US Federal Emergency Management Agency by President Trump in April 2017 and confirmed by the Senate two months later. Fema is responsible for co-ordinating the response to disasters and in his tenure he oversaw 220 of them. He was quickly battered by two hurricanes. Harvey hit Texas with catastrophic effect in August 2017, while Maria a month later devastated Puerto Rico, an unincorporated territory of the US. He was one of those who bore heavy criticism for the response afforded to Puerto Rico. Mr Long gave no explicit reason for his departure, saying in a statement that it was ""time to go home to my family"". During his tenure, he was investigated for using government vehicles to commute from his home in North Carolina to Washington. He was later ordered to pay back the government $151,000 (£117,000) for the cost of several private journeys he claimed on expenses. 21 months from confirmation. Mr Long is executive chairman of Hagerty Consulting, an emergency management consultancy firm where he worked before joining FEMA.  A former Navy SEAL, Ryan Zinke was picked to lead the agency that oversees federal land, including national parks like Yosemite and Yellowstone. He served as a congressman in his home state of Montana before the cabinet appointment. President Trump tweeted that Mr Zinke would be leaving the administration at the end of 2018. He did not offer any further details and it is unclear whether he resigned or was fired.  ""Ryan has accomplished much during his tenure and I want to thank him for his service to our Nation,"" Mr Trump said.  Mr Zinke was under a number of investigations for his conduct in office. They include a land deal in Montana, external involving Mr Zinke and the chairman of oilfield services Halliburton. Almost two years.  In January 2019, Mr Zinke became managing director of Artillery One, an investment firm specialising in the technology and energy sectors. While details of the role are unclear, the company said Mr Zinke would help to ""pursue investing and development opportunities globally"". The retired Marine general was initially nominated to oversee Homeland Security before Mr Trump promoted him to chief of staff in July 2017, replacing Reince Priebus. However, on 8 December Mr Trump announced that Gen Kelly would leave his post by the end of the year. Key Trump aide John Kelly to leave job By December 2018 his relationship with the president was said to have deteriorated, with some reports saying the pair were no longer on speaking terms. Earlier in the year Mr Kelly was forced to deny that he had called Mr Trump an ""idiot"" after the quote was included in a book by the veteran investigative journalist Bob Woodward. About one year, five months. (He was previously Homeland Security secretary from January to July 2017.) Mr Kelly serves on the board of Caliburn International, a professional services firm where we worked . The professional services company has several government contracts, including one to operate a migrant detention centre in Florida. A distinguished former Marine Corps general, Gen Mattis served in the Gulf War, the Afghanistan War and the Iraq War. Before his retirement in 2013 he served as head of US Central Command, and went on to several private sector roles before being tapped to join President Trump's cabinet. He positioned himself as one of the cooler heads throughout the president's term, and was referenced by Democrats and Republicans alike as a ""grown-up"" in the room - a far cry from his ""Mad Dog Mattis"" nickname. The move came just one day after the president controversially announced the withdrawal of US troops from Syria.  Although not referring directly to that, in his resignation letter Gen Mattis said the president had the right to have a defence secretary ""whose views are better aligned"" with his.   The two had diverging public views on a number of subjects, including Mr Trump's decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal.  ""My views on treating allies with respect and also being clear-eyed about both malign actors and strategic competitors are strongly held and informed by over four decades of immersion in these issues,"" Gen Mattis wrote. President Trump was so angered with the letter than he accelerated Gen Mattis' departure date and said he was ""essentially fired."" Just under two years. Gen Mattis has returned to his former role as Fellow at the Hoover Institution - a think tank based at Stanford University. As a Fellow, the institute said he plans ""to focus his research and writing on domestic and international security policy."" In June 2020, he denounced Mr Trump's use of military force to quell anti-racism protests near the White House, and accused his former boss of setting up a ""false conflict"" between the military and civilian society. The former governor of South Carolina was the first non-white woman to be appointed to Mr Trump's cabinet, and the first female, minority governor of her state. She had limited foreign policy experience prior to her role as US envoy and was a vocal critic of Mr Trump during his campaign. As ambassador, she affirmed sanctions on Russia would continue, and that the US military could be deployed in the response to North Korean missile tests. But she frequently clashed with the president over several foreign policy issues, including a proposed ban on immigration to the US from several Muslim-majority countries. Trump names former critic as UN envoy In a news conference with Mr Trump, Mrs Haley announced she was stepping aside after a ""rough"" eight years as governor and envoy.  She will be leaving her post at the end of 2018, but said she did not yet know what her next steps would be. Mrs Haley said she wanted to make sure Mr Trump's administration ""has the strongest person to fight"" for the US at the UN. While accepting her resignation, Mr Trump thanked her and said she did a ""terrific job"", making the role ""very glamorous"". One year, eleven months In April 2019, Ms Haley began sitting on the board of directors at Boeing. Critics suggested that she received the appointment as a reward for the tax breaks and subsidies which Boeing received while she was governor.   The following March, the company announced that she had resigned because she opposed their move to seek financial support from the government amid the coronavirus crisis. The Alabama Republican was the first senator to endorse Donald Trump's presidential candidacy, in early 2016. During the campaign, he became one of Mr Trump's closest national security advisers and, in government, was a supporter of the president's policies on immigration and law enforcement. Mr Sessions became a frequent target of the president's ire as soon as he stepped aside, in March 2017, from the investigation over alleged Russian collusion with Mr Trump's campaign. The recusal allowed his deputy Rod Rosenstein to oversee the inquiry, which led to the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller. At various times, Mr Trump publicly belittled Mr Sessions as ""beleaguered"", ""VERY weak"", and ""DISGRACEFUL"". But Mr Sessions reacted to most of the insults in silence. US media reported that Gen Kelly had called Mr Sessions to say the president wanted him to step down. Mr Trump did not speak to Mr Sessions himself, and announced the departure on Twitter. In his resignation letter, Mr Sessions made clear the decision was not his own, saying: ""Dear Mr President, at your request I am submitting my resignation.""  One year, nine months In July 2020, Mr Sessions lost the Republican nomination for his old Senate seat in Alabama, losing to a candidate backed by Mr Trump. Mr Trump tweeted his delight at the result.  Conceding defeat, Mr Sessions said he still had no regrets over recusing himself from the investigations into allegations of Russian interference. The lawyer served as the attorney general of Oklahoma from 2011 - 2017. He had sued the EPA, the agency which he presided over, a number of times in his role as the state's attorney general. Donald Trump announced that Mr Pruitt had resigned due to ""unrelenting attacks"" on himself and his family. Since taking office, Mr Pruitt was mired in series of scandals concerning his spending habits and alleged misuse of office, and is the subject of at least a dozen investigations into his conduct. He angered many liberals and environmentalists by severely curtailing the agency's activities and repealing many measures designed to protect the environment. The long list of Scott Pruitt controversies While accepting Mr Pruitt's resignation, Mr Trump tweeted that he had done ""an outstanding job, and I will always be thankful to him"". One year, four months A lieutenant general with the US Army, HR McMaster served in Iraq and Afghanistan, where he worked on a government anti-corruption drive. He replaced Lt Gen Michael Flynn, who was fired after just three weeks and three days in the job after he misled Vice-President Pence about his contacts with the Russian ambassador. Time magazine named him as one of its 100 most influential people in the world in 2014, saying he ""might be the 21st Century Army's pre-eminent warrior-thinker"". Mr Trump reportedly disliked his ""gruff and condescending"" manner and the pair reportedly disagreed on the administration's policy towards Russia, North Korea and Iran. Gen Kelly, White House chief of staff at the time, also had little positive to say about him. Thirteen months. Gen McMaster works as a fellow and lecturer at Stanford University. He is also a board member of Spirit of America, a charity which ""improves the safety and success"" of US military personnel and diplomats deployed abroad. In 2020, he is set to release a memoir called ""Battlegrounds"". The former president of the Goldman Sachs bank was appointed as head of the National Economic Council as Mr Trump took office, so becoming the president's top economic adviser. In his time at the White House, he helped push through sweeping reforms on taxes, one of the most significant policy achievements of the administration. But the two were not reported to be close, and rumours of Mr Cohn's departure continued to swirl. A staunch globalist, Mr Cohn had reportedly vowed to quit if Mr Trump pressed ahead with plans to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium imports to the US. According to US media, Mr Cohn initially planned to resign after Mr Trump blamed ""both sides"" for violence at a deadly far-right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017.  Fourteen months. Since leaving, Mr Cohn has become a fellow at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government. Mr Tillerson was the first Secretary of State to be appointed under the Trump administration. A former oil executive, Mr Tillerson pushed for an end to sanctions on Russia and for the resumption of peace talks with North Korea.  But his tenure was reportedly mired by clashes with the president over policy, and by the resignation of several high-ranking career diplomats. Mr Trump said his differences with Mr Tillerson came down to personal ""chemistry"". Indications of the pair's deteriorating relationship first surfaced after reports that Mr Tillerson had called the president a ""moron"". The comment was allegedly made after Mr Trump had pushed for a tenfold increase in America's nuclear arsenal. In a subsequent media appearance, the president challenged Mr Tillerson to ""compare IQ tests. And I can tell you who is going to win"". President Trump announced his departure in a tweet, though Mr Tillerson's spokesperson said he had not told about it beforehand. Fourteen months.  Ms Hicks served as Mr Trump's press secretary and handled media requests during his campaign. She became his fourth director of strategic communications for the Trump White House after Anthony Scaramucci was fired after just 10 days in the job. The fashion model-turned-spokeswoman previously worked as a publicist for Ivanka Trump's fashion label before entering politics with Mr Trump's bid for the White House. Her resignation came a day after she testified to a congressional panel investigating Russian influence on the 2016 election, telling them she had occasionally told ""white lies"" for her boss. Her departure came only weeks after another top aide to Mr Trump, Rob Porter - with whom Ms Hicks was reported to have been in a relationship - quit amid allegations by two ex-wives of abuse. Six years in the Trump Organization, and three years with Mr Trump during his campaign and presidency. After leaving the White House, Ms Hicks became chief communications officer at Fox Corporation, an American broadcasting firm. In February 2020, she returned to the White House, taking on the role of counsellor to the president and reporting to Mr Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner. A doctor and former healthcare executive, Mr Shulkin had served as undersecretary of veterans affairs for health under Barack Obama. President Trump had hailed him as ""fantastic"" when appointing him, and the Senate gave him the only 100-0 confirmation of the Trump team. Mr Shulkin had come under fire for alleged improper behaviour by department staff on a trip to Europe in 2017, including his own acceptance of tickets to the Wimbledon tennis tournament. He denied wrongdoing but agreed to reimburse the government for his wife's air fare for the trip. Mr Shulkin won praise from veterans' groups, but his lack of action on privatising the Veterans Health Administration had angered conservatives. In parting, he condemned the ""toxic, chaotic, disrespectful and subversive"" environment in Washington. Fourteen months In October 2019, the former VA Secretary published a book tracing his 13 months in the Trump administration.  Rob Porter, pictured holding the document for President Trump, was accused of abuse by his two ex-wives A former political aide, Mr Porter was described as Mr Trump's ""right-hand man"" during his tenure. As Staff Secretary he helped to manage the flow of paperwork reaching Trump, from policy memos to speeches and news briefing documents. He was also responsible for circulating documents among senior staff for comment. Mr Porter resigned soon after two of his ex-wives publicly accused him of physical and emotional abuse. One, Colbie Holderness, supplied a photo of herself with a black eye to the media. He denies all the accusations of abuse. The Daily Mail, which broke the story, reported that Mr Porter did not receive security clearance for his White House job after the FBI interviewed his ex-wives during background checks. After his resignation, questions quickly arose over how early the president's chief of staff, Gen Kelly, had been made aware of the accusations by the FBI, and if they had played a role in his diminished security clearance.  One year. Since leaving, the Daily Mail reported that Mr Porter was secretly hired to help with President Trump's 2020 re-election campaign. In an interview with The Daily Beast, the campaign's chief operating officer, Michael Glassner, denied the accusation. Andrew McCabe, a career FBI agent, served as the bureau's acting director for nearly three months after the president sacked James Comey.  He was sacked days before he could retire with pension rights. The attorney has faced repeated criticism from President Trump, who claims his ties to Democrats made him partial in the ongoing Russia investigation. His wife, Jill McCabe, ran a failed Democratic bid for a state senate seat in Virginia in 2015, during which she received $500,000 (£355,000) from a political action group allied with Hillary Clinton - a move which Mr Trump apparently found unforgiveable. He was fired by US Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who said an internal review found he leaked information and misled investigators. Mr McCabe denied the claims and said he was being targeted because of his involvement in the inquiry into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Before his departure, he had been under an internal investigation into the FBI's handling of two key inquiries during the 2016 presidential campaign: the revelations that Hillary Clinton had used a private email server while secretary of state; and suspicions that Russia was interfering to help Mr Trump win the presidency. Two years as FBI deputy director, including a year under Mr Trump's administration. Mr McCabe has retired from the FBI and is a contributor to news broadcaster CNN. The former Georgia congressman was a long-standing opponent of the Affordable Care Act - known as Obamacare. Mr Price was confirmed by the Senate along party lines, amid allegations of insider trading while he worked on healthcare laws - which he denied. As health secretary, Mr Price was involved in President Trump's repeated failures to push through bills repealing Obamacare.  An analysis of transport spending by Politico discovered that Mr Price had, between May and late September, spent more than $1m on flights.  Some $500,000 of that was on military flights approved by the White House, but private charter flights made up at least $400,000 where commercial flights were available. Mr Trump said he was ""not happy"". Almost eight months. Steve Bannon joined the Trump campaign after leading the right-wing Breitbart News website, which rose to prominence through its attacks on mainstream Republicans, as well as those on the left. The website helped to elevate the so-called ""Alt-right"", which critics label a white supremacist group. Like other aides to Mr Trump, he made his fortune as an investment banker, but later turned to financing film and television programmes such as the popular 90s sitcom Seinfeld. Some of Mr Trump's most influential advisers, including his son-in-law Jared Kushner, had been pushing for his departure for months. His firing came amid a public backlash to Mr Trump's response to a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in which an anti-racist protester was killed by a 20-year-old man with Nazi sympathies.  Fired one year after being named campaign chief. After his departure, Mr Bannon briefly rejoined Breitbart News as executive chairman.  He drew ire from President Trump after the publication of Michael Wolff's book Fire and Fury, which detailed several comments made by Mr Bannon that were critical of the administration.  Mr Bannon remains active within politics and has served as an informal advisor to right-wing parties across Europe, Brazil and Israel. As part of this work he co-founded of The Movement, a Brussels-based organisation helping to promote the election of right-wing populist parties across Europe. The brash, Wall Street bigwig has known President Trump for years, and defended him in TV interviews. While in the job, he appeared to accuse then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus of being responsible for White House leaks in a tweet (later deleted) that also appeared to threaten him. Mr Scaramucci then attacked Mr Priebus and President Trump's senior adviser Steve Bannon in an expletive-filled rant on the phone with a reporter from the New Yorker magazine. Although he had boasted of reporting directly to the president, Mr Scaramucci's outbursts may have cost him any post alongside Gen Kelly, who was replacing Reince Priebus as chief of staff. Mr Scaramucci's departure was announced hours after Gen Kelly was sworn-in. Ten days (although his official start date was 15 August - so possibly minus 15 days.) Mr Scaramucci is a contributor to several media outlets and has founded his own media group, The Scaramucci Post. He is also a trustee of the United States Olympic & Paralympic Foundation. Mr Scaramucci has been a vocal critic of President Trump since his departure, and has been the target of several visceral tweets by the commander-in-chief. The former Republican National Committee chairman was one of few Washington veterans given a top role in the Trump White House but was unable to assert his authority. He grappled with competing powers in an administration where Mr Trump's daughter Ivanka, and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, played key roles. President Trump lost confidence in him and clearly wanted a shake-up in the White House, opting for a general to replace the Republican Party operative, who was seen as weak.      The announcement also came as the Republicans failed in their efforts to repeal Obamacare in the Senate. Six months. Mr Spicer famously kicked off his tenure as White House press secretary by defending a seemingly indefensible claim about the crowd size at President Trump's inauguration. Over the course of his time behind the podium he became - unusually for a press secretary - a household name, and was parodied on Saturday Night Live. Unlike most others on this list, Mr Spicer appears to have left on seemingly good terms with the president. He stepped down after Mr Scaramucci was appointed to a role he had partially filled, saying he did not want there to be ""too many cooks in the kitchen"". Six months. Mr Spicer is a public affairs officer with the US Navy and was appointed by President to serve on the US Naval Academy's Board of Visitors. He has also written a book called The Briefing: Politics, the Press and the President in which he referred to Trump as ""unicorn riding a unicorn across a rainbow"". In a surprise public appearance, he entered as a contestant on popular TV show Dancing with the Stars in 2019. Mr Comey played a dramatic and controversial part in the closing stages of the election when he announced, a week before the vote, that the FBI had reopened an investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email server. He was criticised first by Democrats for the timing, then by Republicans when he said a week later that no charges would be brought. The president grew less appreciative of him as the FBI director led an investigation into alleged ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. The Trump administration first claimed Mr Comey's handling of the Clinton email investigation rendered him no longer able to credibly lead the bureau and that Mr Trump had acted on the deputy attorney general's recommendation. However Mr Trump soon contradicted this, calling him a ""showboat"" in a TV interview and saying he was thinking of the ""Russia thing"" when he made the decision to sack him. Three years, eight months. Less than four months under Mr Trump. Since leaving he has been highly critical of the Trump administration. In August 2019, a Department of Justice report concluded that, after losing his job, Mr Comey divulged unclassified information from a memo he had written on his private conversations with Mr Trump.  It ruled that he broke FBI rules by giving the contents of a memo to a friend so that it could be shared with a reporter. But the inspector general did not recommend Mr Comey be sued for the breach. Technically, Michael Flynn resigned, but he was asked to do so by the president. His departure followed weeks of deepening scandal in which it emerged that he had misled White House officials, including the vice-president, over his contact with Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak. Mr Flynn has admitted to lying to the FBI about their pair discussing US sanctions against Russia with Mr Kislyak before Mr Trump took office. It is illegal for private citizens to conduct US diplomacy, and once it was established that Mr Flynn had lied about his contact with Mr Kislyak there was no question that he had to go. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said that the president needed the time to investigate Mr Flynn and establish his guilt, but the scandal prompted fierce speculation over what the president knew of Mr Flynn's contacts with Mr Kislyak. 23 days. Mr Flynn pleaded guilty in 2017 to lying to the FBI. In June 2020, a federal court moved to dismiss charges against him. The president fired Sally Yates after she questioned the legality of Mr Trump's travel ban on seven Muslim-majority countries.  Ms Yates, who was appointed by Barack Obama, believed it discriminated unconstitutionally against Muslims, and ordered justice department lawyers not to enforce the president's executive order. A White House statement said Ms Yates had ""betrayed the Department of Justice by refusing to enforce a legal order designed to protect the citizens of the United States"".  It also described her as ""weak on borders and very weak on illegal immigration"". 10 days. She previously served as deputy attorney general from May 2015 until January 2017. Ms Yates is a partner at law firm King & Spalding, and lectures at Georgetown University Law Centre. It is not uncommon for prosecutors appointed by the previous administration to be replaced as the White House changes hands, but the widely-respected Preet Bharara had been told specifically by the Trump administration that he would be kept on. At the time of his sacking, he was overseeing several high-profile cases, including allegations of sexual harassment at Trump favourite Fox News. Mr Bharara was one of 46 prosecutors asked to resign by the Trump administration, which contended that it was part of a simple changing of the guard. But there was speculation among Democrats and others that Mr Bahara's jurisdiction, which included Trump Tower, may have concerned the president. Seven years, seven months. Less than two months under Mr Trump. Mr Bharara is a Scholar in Residence at New York University Law School, and co-hosts a legal podcast called ""Cafe Insider"". Paul Manafort, a long-time Republican political operative, was supposed to marshal some of the chaos around Mr Trump but ended up falling prey to it.  He was sacked after five months with Mr Trump's campaign, three of those as campaign chair. The Trump campaign didn't give a reason for Mr Manafort's departure, issuing only a statement wishing him well.  But a wave of reports in the week before the announcement alleged that Mr Manafort had received secret cash payments from a pro-Russian political party for representing Russian interests in Ukraine and the US. He has since been jailed for hiding $55m (£42m) from US tax authorities - money he was paid by pro-Russia politicians. Three months. Manafort is serving a more than seven-year sentence for fraud. He was released from prison in May 2020 after his lawyers argued that he was at high risk of contracting coronavirus. He is serving the rest of his sentence under home confinement."
geopolitical tensions,Ukrainians train for war as invasion fears grow,2024-09-15,2022-02-01,By Sarah Rainsford,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-60220422,"Dmytro Dubas thought his war was over. Now the US is warning of an all-out Russian invasion of Ukraine and the veteran volunteer fighter can't ignore it.  ""Last week I was pretty disturbed; I even went to my psychologist for help,"" he admits. For months, Ukraine's Western allies have been pointing to Russian troops massing on the border. That's prompted military analysts abroad to produce endless maps covered in arrows that confidently predict how Vladimir Putin's troops will advance on Kyiv.  Ukrainians who'd be in the direct line of any such incursion are far less convinced it will happen.  But all the war talk is unsettling. ""Russia can always transfer troops to the border in a matter of days and then invade, so this build-up is nothing different,"" Dmytro argues, in his Kyiv flat.                                             In 2014, then working in sales, he joined the flood of volunteer soldiers pouring east when heavy fighting against Russian-backed forces erupted. There's been a formal ceasefire in place since 2015 but it breaks down regularly and the threat of a sudden escalation in the violence is ever present.  But Dmytro had returned to civilian life, storing the reminders of his time in the trenches in an old ammunition box painted and re-fashioned as a coffee table in his living room. Now he's calmed his nerves by preparing for the worst possible scenario: filling his car with fuel, buying emergency food supplies and signing-up with the territorial defence force to brush-up his skills. Western intelligence agencies have ascribed all sorts of plans to Vladimir Putin, including besieging Kyiv. Ukrainian officials from President Volodymyr Zelensky down have batted-back that idea, wary of spreading panic.  At the same time, city schools are practising bomb scare or air raid drills, social media is full of official guides to preparing an emergency ""grab bag"" for evacuation and people have begun plotting their escape route which mostly involves driving west as fast as they can. Even pensioners have been joining weekend drills in woodland outside Kyiv where concrete factory ruins covered in graffiti stand-in for a battlefield. The men are too old to sign formal contracts, but military trainers don't turn them away. ""I don't think the Russians will invade now thanks to our Western allies giving us weapons,"" 61-year-old Vasyl Nazarov says during a break from crouching on the ice and swivelling back and forth to train his weapon on an imaginary enemy. It's his first session so his ""gun"" is a wooden cut-out for now. ""I don't believe they'll reach Kyiv but we have to be ready for that,"" Vasyl adds.  ""I think the West's threat of terrible sanctions will stop Putin,"" Serhiy Kalinin agrees, flicking a cigarette butt into a snowdrift. It's a few decades since the 64-year-old finished his mandatory military service so he wanted a refresher course. ""The enemy is at our border,"" he says. ""So everyone should be prepared."" At the privately-owned Priamyi TV channel, Russia's deployment of some 100,000 troops to its border with Ukraine has now become ""topic number one"". Presenter Taras Berezovets describes Russia's president as ""unpredictable"" and worries about Mr Putin's ""idée fixe"" that Ukraine has never been a sovereign nation.  ""Putin wants to stop a nation making its own choice, like Soviet leaders did in Eastern Europe for decades,"" the journalist says. His own biography captures some of the complexity of this conflict: his first language is Russian as he's originally from Crimea which Russia annexed illegally from Ukraine in the wake of mass protests in 2014 demanding closer ties with Europe. But Mr Berezovets says his roots don't make him pro-Moscow, or part of any supposed ""Russian world"". ""We made our choice in 2014 and it's clear: we don't want to be part of the Russian 'empire',"" he says firmly. ""Even if there's no chance of joining the EU or Nato, our target is to be part of Western civilisation which means the rule of law, freedom of speech. These are things Ukrainians are ready to fight for."" Despite the Western intelligence reports, Dmytro Dubas and his friends don't sense that an all-out fight over Ukraine's future is just around the corner. The veterans have made plans to send their families to safety, just in case, and agreed where the fighters will meet up and how they'll arm themselves.  But that done, they're focussed on business as usual not an external threat they have to live with long-term and geopolitical forces they can't control. ""It's a famous meme that the biggest headache for Ukraine is being next door to Russia,"" Dmytro shrugs, at a gathering of close friends and colleagues in his kitchen. A fellow veteran volunteer rattles off a whole lot of crises his country has already seen and survived: from the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster to two revolutions then war in the east. ""It's normal in Ukraine for everything around to be in flames,"" Artem smiles.  ""If you think of war every hour of every day you just go crazy,"" another friend, Yuliia, agrees.  ""After all, we can't just pick up Russia and move it, however much we might like to. It's our neighbour and we have to live with that."""
geopolitical tensions,Island trip lays bare US-China tussle in the Pacific,2024-09-15,2022-08-06,By Boer Deng,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-62440921,"They are hundreds of miles from the nearest continent - an archipelago of over 900 islands home to a population smaller than that of the single US city of Seattle - but a tiny nation in the South Pacific has become a new front in the battle for supremacy with China. It was a starless night when a ship commanded by a young American lieutenant collided with a Japanese destroyer in the South Pacific. The US ship was sunk, but the commander survived, was hailed as a hero, and later became president. The famed episode of the mission gone awry in 1943 that eventually helped launch the political career of John F Kennedy was perhaps the last time the Solomon Islands, a tiny island nation at the edge of what was once the British empire, figured into the consciousness of the American public. The Solomons were the site of a major allied offensive against Japan in the Second World War, the Guadalcanal campaign that began in 1942, making clear the importance of the Pacific to the West. As its 80th anniversary is marked on 7 August, the US is finally, after long neglect, paying attention again. This time US allies are wary of a different power: the rising influence of China.  But, experts say, they are caught on the back foot. Stretching thousands of miles, spanning across hemispheres, the 12 island nations and myriad of territories that make up Oceania are the gateway to Asia from the Pacific. The vast geographic cover means crucial roles played in everything from shipping routes to fishing rights to environmental protection. ""From a hard, strategic standpoint, they matter [for] the US to project military and economic power from the Western Pacific all the way to South East Asia,"" according to Alex Gray, an Indo-Pacific security expert at the American Foreign Policy Council. ""The same imperatives have been there since the 19th Century - if you're trying to get to East Asia, you have to go through the Pacific islands"". Three island nations in the North Pacific - Micronesia, Palau and the Marshall Islands - give exclusive military use rights to the US, while the South Pacific Islands, including the Solomons, are a passage to Australia and New Zealand. Yet Western governments have taken their importance for granted since at least the Cold War, said Mr Gray. The view had been that newly created nations in Central Asia and the great tussles in South East Asia took precedence.  But China has always remained astute, and has been particularly acutely aware of the strategic importance of the region, Mr Gray argued. ""If you look at Chinese writing at think tanks, on foreign policy issues…[they] write very eloquently about how different islands fit in to communication channels, and sea lines across the Pacific, and have been across this throughout the 21 Century."" According to China watchers, Beijing has been courting Pacific island nations for at least the last 15 years, giving VIP treatment to heads of state and attempting to sign infrastructure and military agreements. A renewed focus on the Pacific only began under the Trump administration, experts say, after China's growing influence could no longer be ignored, resulting in the leaders of three North Pacific nations coming to the White House for the first time in 2019.  Now, a security agreement inked between the Solomon Islands and China in March has raised alarm in the South Pacific, especially as its government and that of the nearby nation of Kiribati have already switched their allegiances from Taipei, the capital of Taiwan, to Beijing. ""We're kind of playing catch-up big time,"" said Derek Grossman of the Rand Corporation, a think-tank.  The fear, said Mr Grossman, is that China could eventually establish a military base that would challenge the West's ability to access Asia.  ""We've essentially neglected it [the Pacific region] and that's been to our detriment."" That view appears to be shared by the Biden administration, as well as in Canberra. The US last had an embassy in Honiara, the Solomons' capital, in 1993, but its doors were closed and services folded into those at the US outpost in Papua New Guinea, some 870 miles (1,400 km) away.  In the weeks before the security agreement with Beijing had been leaked, Secretary of State Antony Blinken had announced plans to reopen it.  The security agreement has hastened the sense of urgency, and now, for the anniversary of the Guadalcanal campaign, the State department is dispatching two senior officials - Mr Blinken's deputy Wendy Sherman, and Caroline Kennedy, daughter of the president and the new US ambassador to Australia - in what is being seen as the most high-profile visit to the South Pacific in years. Upon her arrival in Canberra last month, Ms Kennedy told reporters that the US ""needs to do more"" in the Pacific, acknowledging that ""we haven't been there in a while"" but China ""certainly has a big presence"". As part of the trip, the two women are also making stops in Samoa and Tonga. After her arrival in Tonga, Ms Sherman stressed the fact the US wanted ""to partner with"" the region, adding - in what could be perceived as a dig at rivals in the region - the US wanted to ""make sure you get to choose your own future and that neither we, nor anybody else, decides it for you"". She also revealed the region's leaders would be invited to Washington for a meeting and dinner later in August, adding it would ""be a historic opportunity with the United States and Pacific islands countries to hear and listen, the Pacific way"". Though it is unclear what, if any fruits, will be borne of the visit, there is hope that the West may yet win back the favour of a vast region it can ill-afford to take for granted. ""Since 1945, we've assumed that we can move unhindered from Hawaii to East Asia. If China is able to militarise this region, that completely changes the calculus for American security and for Western allies,"" said Mr Gray.  With their appearance in the Solomon Islands, marking the remembrance of solidarity with the West, ""I think the phrase 'better late than never' really applies,"" he added."
geopolitical tensions,Ukraine crisis: Putin's geopolitical jigsaw,2024-09-15,2022-01-28,By Steve Rosenberg,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-60152007,"Ever tried doing a jigsaw which has half the pieces missing? It's frustrating. It's confusing. You never see the full picture.  Welcome to the world of Kremlin politics.  Puzzling out what Vladimir Putin is thinking and planning is challenging, to say the least. That's how the Kremlin likes it: keeping everyone guessing.  What is President Putin's plan for Ukraine? Is Moscow preparing a full-scale invasion? A more limited operation? Or is the sabre-rattling simply brinkmanship, coercive diplomacy (at its most coercive)?  The geopolitical jigsaw is incomplete.  The pieces of the puzzle we do have are causing concern in the West:  Washington has now replied in writing to Moscow's security demands. The Kremlin says it will analyse America's response. In the meantime, the tough talking continues. ""Do not put Nato infrastructure on Ukrainian territory. We ask our 'partners' in Nato countries to get out. Get out from our borders. Get out from post-Soviet countries, because it's threatening to Russian people,"" says Yevgeny Popov. Mr Popov, who hosts a talk show on state TV, is also an MP from the party of power, United Russia. ""Time is running out,"" Mr Popov warns me. ""You have to make a decision. Fast."" ""Otherwise what?"" I ask. ""Otherwise it will be a tremendously dangerous reaction for the whole world. Some Western officials said that Russia has no balls. Guys, do you really want to see it?"" In public, Russian officials insist that Nato is a danger to Russia's national security.  I'm sceptical. I find it hard to believe that Moscow truly sees the alliance is a threat.  Only 6% of Russia's borders touch Nato countries; the Kremlin has good relations with some Nato members, like Italy and Hungary; it's even sold weapons systems to Nato member Turkey.  And keep in mind that Nato (in the shape of Norway) has been on Russia's border for more than 70 years.  Plus, there is no sign whatsoever of Ukraine, Georgia or other former Soviet states being accepted into Nato in the near future. So why is the Kremlin fixating on the Nato alliance?  Partly for domestic reasons: to get the Russian people to unite against an alleged external enemy.  But also, perhaps, as an excuse to use this moment to reshape the European security order to Moscow's benefit; to re-establish Russia's sphere of influence and try to rewrite the results of the Cold War. ""Putin believes the West exploited Russian weakness in the 1990s, that Russia wasn't treated fairly and didn't get what it deserved. He wants to change that,"" believes Andrei Kortunov, director general of the Russian International Affairs Council, a think-tank linked to the authorities.  ""His argument is very simple. Now the balance of powers has shifted, it's no longer the West-centred unipolar world. You should listen to us and take our concerns seriously.""  So what will Moscow's next step be?  Without all the pieces of the jigsaw, we can only guess. It may depend on whether America's offer to negotiate with Russia on some aspects of European security will be enough to satisfy Vladimir Putin.  If it's not, if the Kremlin leader is determined to dismantle the current European security architecture, military confrontation is possible and long-term friction between East and West. ""I hope Putin will be satisfied with what he got so far,"" Mr Kortunov tells me. ""I think to some extent he was successful. He enforced a dialogue on the West. So, he could argue his mission was accomplished; that keeping tensions on the Ukrainian border helped him incentivise the West to consider Russian proposals.  ""But he may have a different interpretation. He may say the West is trying to engage Russia in endless and pointless negotiations and that Western penetration into Ukraine will continue.  ""Domestically, though, Russian society is not eager for a big war on its doorstep. Russians are not eager to participate in a major military operation in Ukraine,"" Mr Kortunov adds."
geopolitical tensions,Trudeau says Canada-India ties important despite row,2024-09-15,2023-09-29,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-66956827,"Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said his country is serious about building closer ties with India despite an ongoing diplomatic row. His latest remarks come at a time when ties between the two countries are at an all time low. Tensions flared up when Mr Trudeau on 19 September said Canada was investigating credible allegations of India's involvement in the murder of a Sikh separatist leader. Delhi dismissed the claim as ""absurd"". Hardeep Singh Nijjar was murdered outside a temple in Canada in June. On Thursday, the Canadian PM said it was extremely important to ""constructively and seriously"" engage with India. ""India is a growing economic power and important geopolitical player. And as we presented our Indo-Pacific strategy just last year, we're very serious about building closer ties with India,"" the National Post quoted him as saying. Tensions between the two countries came to the fore during the G20 summit in Delhi on 9 September when Mr Trudeau skipped an official dinner of the leaders.  He held a short meeting with Indian PM Narendra Modi but experts described their body language as ""frosty"". A few days later, Mr Trudeau told Canadian parliament they were pursing credible allegations of the involvement of Indian agents in Nijjar's murder. Both countries have since expelled a diplomat each of the other nation. Last week, India also suspended visa services for Canadians citing security concerns at its diplomatic missions in the country. On Thursday, Mr Trudeau talked about the importance of relations with India but added that the murder investigation would continue. ""At the same time, obviously, as a rule of law country, we need to emphasise that India needs to work with Canada to ensure that we get the full facts of this matter,"" he said. India has insisted that it had no role in the murder, adding that Nijjar had been designated a terrorist by Delhi in 2020 - an allegation his supporters vehemently deny. The Indian government has often reacted sharply to demands by Sikh separatists in Western countries for Khalistan, or a separate Sikh homeland. Nijjar vocally supported the Khalistan movement. It peaked in India in the 1980s with a violent insurgency centred in Sikh-majority Punjab state. It was quelled by force and has little resonance in India now, but is still popular among some in the Sikh diaspora in countries such as Canada, Australia and the UK. The row between India and Canada, who have been close allies for decades, has also tested Western countries. The US, UK and Australia have urged Delhi to cooperate in the investigation but stopped short of critising India, which is seen by them as bulwark against China's rise in Asia. Mr Trudeau added that he had been assured by the US that foreign secretary Antony Blinken would raise the allegations when he met his Indian counterpart S Jaishankar in Washington. The foreign ministers met on Thursday but made no mention of Canada in their press conference. BBC News India is now on YouTube.

geopolitical tensions,F-35C fighter jet recovered from South China Sea,2024-09-15,2022-03-03,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-60607784,"The US Navy has said it has retrieved a stealth fighter jet from the depths of the South China Sea where it sank after a ""mishap"" in January.  A major operation was launched to recover the $100m (£74m) F-35C jet - the newest, most advanced in the US force. The aircraft ended up in at the bottom of the South China Sea following a landing problem on the USS Carl Vinson. The region has been a source of rising US-China tensions in recent years. The F-35C Lightning II was retrieved on Wednesday from a depth of 12,400 feet (3,780 metres) using a remotely operated vehicle that fastened rigging and lift lines to the aircraft. A hook was lowered from a diving support ship's crane to the sea floor, which was attached to the rigging. The jet was then lifted to the surface and hoisted aboard the vessel.  ""The recovery effort shows the US Navy's commitment to its assets, and a free and open Indo-Pacific,"" the Navy said in a statement.  Seven sailors were injured in the crash earlier this year, when the F-35C struck the deck of aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson in a crash landing made during a military exercise.  The single-engine stealth fighter impacted the flight deck of the 100,00-tonne aircraft carrier and then fell into the sea, the Navy said. The pilot was ejected to safety and rescued in a helicopter.  The South China Sea, home to vital shipping lanes, has been a geopolitical flashpoint for years, with several countries claiming ownership of its small islands and reefs and with it, access to its resources. China has taken increasingly forceful steps to assert its claim of the territory, refusing to recognise a 2016 international tribunal ruling saying there was no evidence that China had historically exercised exclusive control over the waters."

Five of the islands are coral atolls, the other four consist of land rising from the sea bed. Formerly known as the Ellice Islands, all are low-lying, with no point on Tuvalu being higher than 4.5m above sea level. Local politicians have campaigned against climate change, arguing that it could see the islands swamped by rising sea levels. Life on the islands is simple and often harsh. There are no streams or rivers, so the collection of rain is essential. Coconut palms cover most of the islands, and copra - dried coconut kernel - is practically the only export commodity.

geopolitical tensions,Putin: From Russia's KGB to a presidency defined by war,2024-09-15,2011-09-24,Paul Kirby,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-15047823,"Vladimir Putin has been in power since 2000, longer than any Kremlin leader since Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin.  Now into his fifth term as president, aged 71, all semblance of opposition to his rule is gone and there is little to stop him staying on, if he wants, until 2036. And yet, it was almost by accident that this little-known, former KGB man was hand-picked for the Kremlin. A case of being in the right place at the right time in predecessor Boris Yeltsin's inner circle. Vladimir Putin was a street-fighting boy whose early years were spent in a communal flat, or kommunalka, in communist Leningrad.  Although he appeared to embrace liberal, democratic Russia, he later described the chaotic collapse of the Soviet Union as ""the biggest geopolitical catastrophe of the [20th] Century"".  Determined to prevent Ukraine from leaving Russia's orbit, he unleashed Europe's biggest war since World War Two, with a full-scale invasion on 24 February 2022. He often justifies his actions with an outlandish perception of history and a keen resentment of Nato. Before the invasion, and since, he falsely claimed that Ukraine was an artificial state populated by neo-Nazis. And he sought to stop Ukraine getting closer to Nato. The Western leader who arguably knew him best was Germany's former chancellor Angela Merkel, who is once reputed to have described him as out of touch with reality and ""in another world"". She repeatedly tried to negotiate with Vladimir Putin, but after he sent troops to invade Kyiv she came to the conclusion ""he wants to destroy Europe"". Rosenberg: Russia's stage-managed election Occupied Ukraine forced to vote in Putin's election Ukrainecast on BBC Sounds: Putin claims victory - what next for Russia? Vladimir Putin was born seven years after the end of World War Two - following the siege of Leningrad which killed his elder brother and which his parents barely survived. He had a tough childhood that would affect the rest of his life. In an interview in 2000, he remembered cornering a large rat on the staircase of his communal apartment block. It had nowhere to run. Putin described the rat lashing out and throwing itself at him: ""There, on the landing, I got a quick and lasting lesson in the meaning of the word cornered."" In 2000, a 10-year-old Japanese girl floored Mr Putin in Tokyo The young Putin got into fights with local boys who were often bigger and stronger. Later, he would look back on that time and describe himself as a ""hooligan"". He took up judo, which he continued as a black belt during his presidency, and the Russian martial art of sambo, and stayed close to his childhood partners, Arkady and Boris Rotenberg.  In 2015, he reflected on his early experiences on the streets of what is now St Petersburg: ""Fifty years ago the Leningrad street taught me a rule: if a fight is inevitable, you have to throw the first punch."" After studying at Leningrad State University, in 1975 he went straight into the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB. It was a natural step for a law graduate, and it suited him perfectly. It was also a dream job for a young man brought up on Soviet TV shows such as The Sword and the Shield, which recounted the derring-do of an undercover Russian spy in Nazi Germany. ""I was a pure and utterly successful product of Soviet patriotic education,"" he reflected. By now, he spoke good German and he was posted to the East German city of Dresden in 1985 where he saw first-hand the collapse of a communist state in 1989. Vladimir Putin's formative German years From the KGB headquarters across the road, he watched as crowds stormed the headquarters of the East German secret police, the Stasi. When a small group approached his building, he warned them off.  But when he called a Red Army tank unit for protection, he realised Russia was of no help: ""We cannot do anything without orders from Moscow. And Moscow is silent."" The next year, he returned to a political system in free fall. He was given the rank of lieutenant-colonel, but never excelled at the KGB. One of his superiors, Nikolai Leonov, considered him a ""mediocre agent"".  To this day, he retains a small circle of KGB colleagues from Leningrad as his closest confidants - long-standing allies such as Nikolai Patrushev, the secretary of Russia's Security Council. It was not because of their ""pretty eyes"" he recruited them, his old judo coach Anatoly Rakhlin once recalled, ""but because he trusts people who've proved themselves"". Those he trusts, he often enriches. He handed childhood friend Arkady Rotenberg a $3.5bn (£2.7bn) contract to build a bridge from Russia to occupied Crimea. He is intensely private about his personal life, and divorced his wife Lyudmila in 2013 after 30 years of marriage.  They had two daughters, widely named as Maria Vorontsova, an academic and businesswoman, and Katerina Tikhonova, head of a research foundation. Vladimir Putin's younger daughter, Katerina Tikhonova, is known to love acrobatic rock 'n' roll From 1991, Vladimir Putin became deputy to the new mayor of Leningrad, Anatoly Sobchak, and a highly valued adviser. When Sobchak was voted out, his deputy was headhunted to work in the presidential administration in Moscow. These were the dying years of the Boris Yeltsin administration and Putin's rise was meteoric. He spent a short time as head of the Federal Security Service, which replaced the KGB, and was then asked to report to the president as secretary of the Security Council.  On 9 August 1999, an ailing Yeltsin sacked his prime minister, replacing him with a little-known 46-year-old protege who would see through reforms ahead of presidential elections in 2000. Yeltsin was by now in need of a successor. ""Putin had shown himself to be a liberal and a democrat, who wanted to continue market reforms,"" said Valentin Yumashev, who told Yeltsin he would make a ""superb candidate"". The man who helped put Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin As Yeltsin's presidency faded away, Moscow was hit by a series of deadly but unexplained bombings. Vladimir Putin responded with a full-scale land offensive to recapture the mainly Muslim Russian republic of Chechnya from separatist rebels. His popularity soared and on 31 December 1999 he was appointed acting president, winning his first presidential term three months later. Thousands of civilians died in the Chechen campaign and, as he often does, Vladimir Putin used crude language to describe how he would wipe out the rebels ""even in the toilet"". The capital Grozny was devastated; Russia's leader had his victory. His first domestic challenge came in 2000, when the nuclear submarine Kursk sank in an accident in the Barents Sea, with the loss of all 118 crew. President Putin remained on holiday and initially refused offers of international help. Many of the crew died waiting to be rescued. TV viewers watched as grieving women screamed at their president. Russia marks Kursk anniversary Four years later, Chechen rebels took 1,000 hostages, most of them children, at a school in Beslan, North Ossetia. When Russian special forces stormed the building, 330 people died. It later emerged that Russia had intelligence of a planned attack but had failed to act. The first years of the Putin presidency were both bloody and turbulent, but the Russian economy was doing well, buoyed by high oil prices. He won public support for taking on the billionaire oligarchs who had run rife in Russia in the 1990s. Summoning them to the Kremlin, he said they could keep their money as long as they kept out of politics and backed him. He acted fast against those who didn't, such as Russia's then-wealthiest man Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who was arrested at gunpoint and jailed in Siberia. Russia's president had something of a honeymoon with the West. He was one of the first foreign leaders to ring President George W Bush after the 9/11 al-Qaeda attacks on the US. He even helped the US launch its ensuing campaign in Afghanistan.  ""I looked the man in the eye. I found him to be very straightforward and trustworthy,"" said President Bush. But Vladimir Putin soon became disillusioned with the US and its allies. Relations with the UK soured when a former KGB agent and Kremlin critic Alexander Litvinenko was murdered in London using radioactive polonium-210. A UK inquiry found later that the Russian leader had ""probably approved"" the KGB attack. On a visit to the Munich Security Conference in 2007, Putin made his feelings towards the US clear. ""One state, the United States, has overstepped its national borders in every way,"" he complained. It was an icy reminder of the old Cold War and an expression of Russia's anger that the US was continuing to plan for a missile defence system in Central Europe. ""The stones of the Berlin Wall have long been distributed as souvenirs… and now they are trying to impose new dividing lines and walls on us,"" said Putin. It did not take him long to show he was prepared to use military power to undermine pro-Western leaders in former Soviet states. In 2008, Russian forces routed the Georgian army and took over two of its breakaway regions - Abkhazia and South Ossetia. It was a very personal clash with Georgia's then pro-Nato President, Mikheil Saakashvili.  Vladimir Putin was by now prime minister, as the constitution barred him serving a third consecutive term as president, but it was clear he still held the levers of power. Vladimir Putin, seen here in 2015 with Dmitry Medvedev Today that problem no longer exists. He steered through a law in 2021 that reset his limit to zero, which means he can head straight into a fifth term, and even a sixth. Russia in 2024 is very different from the restive country in the run-up to the third Putin term.  In 2011, the biggest mass protests since the collapse of the Soviet Union erupted in Russia's major cities in response to widespread allegations of fraud in parliamentary elections. Among the protest leaders was Boris Nemtsov, a liberal, former deputy prime minister in the 1990s. Another rising figure was anti-corruption blogger Alexei Navalny, who labelled Mr Putin's United Russia ""the party of crooks and thieves"". Now, genuine opposition has all but vanished.  Nemtsov was shot dead on a bridge, in view of the Kremlin, in 2015. Navalny survived a nerve agent poison attack in 2020, before he was thrown in jail in January 2021 and died three years later. His widow has accused Vladimir Putin of murder. Putin has secured the support of the Orthodox Church and he has built a National Guard, or Rosgvardiya, that reports direct to him. Acts of public defiance are few and far between, and newly created offences targeting those who discredit the military and disseminate fake news are widely used to silence dissent. Russia's media is largely pliant and controlled by the Kremlin, which has become consumed by an all-out war in Ukraine. Yevgeny Prigozhin thrived for years under Vladimir Putin until he led an armed rebellion in 2023 Putin faced a short, armed rebellion in June 2023, when the formerly loyal mercenary leader Yevgeny Prigozhin sent his forces on the road to Moscow. But it was snuffed out and Prigozhin was later killed in a mysterious plane crash. Some 40% of budget spending in 2024 will go on defence and security, as President Putin diverts much of the economy to the war. Putin's war in Ukraine started, not in February 2022, but with the seizure of Ukraine's Crimean peninsula in 2014. Putin reveals secret Crimea plot The night that Ukraine's pro-Moscow leader fled violent protests in Kyiv and was effectively ousted, the Russian president said he held an all-night meeting and told his colleagues it was time to ""bring Crimea back into Russia"".  Pro-Russian agitators then seized swathes of Ukraine's Donbas region and war took hold in the east for eight years - until Putin decided he would invade from the north, south and east in a bid to overthrow Ukraine's elected government and seize Kyiv, with the invasion in 2022 . He has repeatedly sought to justify the war. He writes long historical essays, gives speeches and lectures the few foreign visitors that come. But it is a distorted, selective history that brooks no dissent. Civil rights group Memorial, which has devoted decades to remembering the victims of Soviet repression, has been banned.  Its veteran co-president Oleg Orlov was jailed for this description of the Putin era: ""They wanted fascism, and they got it."" Will Putin rule Russia forever?

geopolitical tensions,How Israel-Gaza war is spilling into cultural life,2024-09-15,2024-03-03,By Katie Razzall,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-68457690,"The divisions playing out in demonstrations on British streets are also playing out in all our lives - and increasingly in the cultural world too. With antisemitism and Islamophobia rising, words and actions really matter, but from the pavements to the playgrounds to the playhouses, the Israel-Gaza conflict is polarising opinion - and protests have spilled into the cultural world, with some inevitable backlash. There have been high-profile examples of cultural figures venturing into the political arena and taking a stance on what's unfolding. Charlotte Church sang the controversial pro-Palestinian chant ""From the river to the sea"" at a concert. (She denied she was antisemitic).  The comedian Paul Currie pulled out a Palestinian flag after his show ended at London's Soho Theatre and told Jewish audience members who didn't stand up to ""get out"". (The theatre apologised and said it wouldn't be inviting Currie back). And Belfast rappers Kneecap recently appeared on the Late Late Show in Ireland wearing pro-Palestinian outfits. (They apparently flouted rules set by the broadcaster). How is what's happening in the Middle East - and the tensions being driven here by war and violence there - impacting the UK's arts and entertainment sphere? What role does culture have to heal political divides - or foment them?  They're questions I wanted to explore with figures working in that world, to understand where culture fits at a time that emotions are running understandably high. Artists speaking up for causes they believe in isn't new. Dame Vanessa Redgrave is almost as renowned for her political views as her acting talents. It's hardly surprising there are people who want to protest about what's happening in Gaza. The cultural world contains a lot of left-leaning voices.  We've also seen (so far resisted) calls for Israel to be banned from having a pavilion at the Venice Biennale and from competing in the Eurovision song contest. Dame Helen Mirren and Boy George were amongst the artists to sign an open letter in favour of Israel taking part in what they called ""unifying events such as singing competitions"". They argued the contest is a crucial way ""to help bridge our cultural divides and unite people of all backgrounds"".  Talking more broadly, the theatre director Iqbal Khan, associate director at the Birmingham Rep, says ""the nuance in these issues is being destroyed"". He calls the polarisation across all forms of public life ""really concerning"", describing ""a constant requirement to attach yourself to metaphorical flags and tribes of opinion which don't represent the truth of things."" David Baddiel raised the issue of tribalism on the BBC's Today programme last week. The comedian, writer and broadcaster said ""within the space I come from - culture, showbusiness, artists, whatever - it feels there is a lot of support for Palestinians and it may feel that the Jewish voice isn't able to be heard and cowers a bit at the moment"". He added that Baroness Warsi, the former Conservative deputy chairwoman and his co-host on a new podcast, had told him Muslims feel similarly excluded and silenced in the world of politics and government.  Many would point to Lee Anderson's comments about ""Islamists"" controlling the London mayor as evidence of that. The actress and writer Tracy-Ann Oberman told me that ""for those of us that have lived with Israeli and with Middle Eastern politics for a very long time, who've worked in advocacy between Palestinians and Israelis and who really understand the geopolitics of the region, we look at people who seem to have suddenly been educated at the University of TikTok to understand the situation - which is of course far too complex to be broken down in a 60-second video"". She adds that ""we're in shock because of what they're allowing themselves to say and to be part of"". Each night, more horror unfolds in Gaza, with grim milestones passed and devastating images beamed into our homes. The conflict was sparked by horrific acts of murder and rape carried out in Israel by Hamas on 7 October, and the ongoing trauma of the hostages held in Gaza. The actor Khalid Abdalla, who plays Dodi Fayed in The Crown, says ""what is very hard is to find a voice which can speak in a way that honours the fact that there is grief and immense legacies on both sides"". But with no political solution, no ceasefire, and ""this scale of slaughter, what's left for people other than to protest? And if they have a platform culturally, to use it"". It's ""very charged territory"" but there is ""a moral imperative to take a stand"".  The tensions in the Middle East can have real world consequences in the UK, not just in racist attacks on the streets. Tracy-Ann Oberman's timely reimagining of Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice is her attempt to ""reclaim"" a difficult play full of antisemitic tropes. She wanted people to ""see on stage what anti-Jewish hatred looks like"". She is a vocal antisemitism campaigner - often ""the lone voice in a room with so-called progressive creatives"" she says. She told me she now has personal security as well as security guards who patrol the theatre as she performs her play The Merchant of Venice 1936. ""You've got a Jewish actress who has to have security in the West End because of speaking out about the rapes on 7 October and the industry has not risen up and said 'that's wrong'."" ""There should be more people who are saying 'this is unacceptable'. They would find it unacceptable if this was happening to any other minority"". ""The country should take this very seriously. As history has proven, what starts with the Jews doesn't end with the Jews"". Clearly, a line is breached if - in these inflamed times - people feel unsafe.  Khan says ""the right of an artist to show solidarity with people who are suffering should be absolutely honoured. The minute though somebody's safety is threatened, that's different"". He uses what happened at the Soho Theatre comedy show as an example of that.  ""Everybody in that cultural space should feel safe. And I'm not sure in the Soho instance that happened"". (Soho Theatre is still investigating what happened but said while it robustly supported the right of artists to express a wide range of views in their shows, ""intimidation of audience members, acts of antisemitism or any other forms of racism will not be tolerated"".) Khan says while ""vigorous debate"" is useful, people ""need to talk without encroaching on another's safety or inciting others to violence"". He believes there is ""enormous support culturally for those who oppose antisemitism"". There is also ""massive disgust at what is going on in Gaza at the moment, with obviously the understanding that the atrocity that began all of this was the particular set of events on 7 October"".  ""The response feels appalling to a lot of people… that's the thing that's motivating those voices. ""I was horrified at what happened on 7 October. But the continuing response and the amount, I would describe it as a genocide."" The cultural space being used as a vehicle for activism isn't new.  Art never operates in a vacuum. Think back to 1985 when Spitting Image broadcast a satirical song, released for sale the following year, called ""I've never met a nice South African"". It was an attack on that country's apartheid regime and was comedic and pretty uncontroversial. Fast forward to 2022 and the Baftas took place soon after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.  Stars of the film world including Benedict Cumberbatch turned up wearing blue and yellow badges in support, and the Ukraine flag was projected onto the side of the Royal Albert Hall. Then, last summer, Liverpool hosted Eurovision on behalf of Ukraine - in a sun-filled, joyful coming together of cultures. But these geopolitical issues are viewed as binary, for the vast majority in the UK anyway. Apartheid was wrong and the invasion of Ukraine is unjust - that's the prevailing Western narrative, and nobody is taking to the streets or our TV screens to say otherwise. Those artists picked a side and were lauded for it. The Israel-Gaza war is also binary for many, with more than 30,000 killed in Gaza and about 1,200 killed in Israel. But perhaps that leaves no room for nuance or an understanding that Jews in Britain aren't representatives of the Israeli state, just as British Muslims don't speak for Hamas - and that there is genuine fear in our minority communities as tensions rise. Oberman says ""a lot of people don't seem to understand you can both be heartbroken at the situation in Gaza and be appalled at the rise in antisemitism in the UK - the two are not mutually exclusive"". So where does all this leave that hard won right to freedom of expression? She argues ""it's sacrosanct but it doesn't seem to be working for the Jewish community at the moment"". Abdalla says ""either we believe in freedom of expression or we don't… artists and workers in culture generally have a responsibility to find ways to express whatever is culturally important to their age"". He believes the cultural arena ""has to be a safe space for difficult conversations. The failure in public discourse has fed this crisis and we have a duty to confront that."" ""We need our artists, our cultural workers to be finding a way through, to find a language that can speak a way through, as part of finding a political solution."""
geopolitical tensions,'Lose-lose' anxiety marks global security talks in Munich,2024-09-15,2024-02-19,By Lyse Doucet,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68334715,"It's called the Munich Rule: engage and interact; don't lecture or ignore one another. But this year, at the 60th Munich Security Conference (MSC), two of the most talked-about people weren't even here.   That included former US President Donald Trump, whose possible return to the White House could throw a spanner in the work of the transatlantic relationship, which lies at the heart of this premier international forum.  And Russia's President Vladimir Putin, who was vehemently blamed by one world leader after another for the death of his most prominent critic Alexei Navalny, not to mention his full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which continues to cast a long dark shadow across Europe and far beyond. The staggering news of Navalny's death, which broke just hours before the conference kicked off on Friday, underlined again the perilous unpredictability of a world carved up by multiple fault lines and entrenched interests. ""We live in a world where there is more and more confrontation and less co-operation,"" regretted the EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Josep Borrell. ""The world has become a much more dangerous place,"" he told me as the conference drew to a close on Sunday. ""Lose-Lose?"" was the maxim of this year's gathering, at a time of deepening geopolitical tensions and jarring economic uncertainties.  The MSC's annual report warned that it could give rise to ""lose-lose"" dynamics among governments, ""a downwards spiral that jeopardises co-operation and undermines the existing international order"". ""I think this has been the conference of a disordered world,"" reflected David Miliband, the CEO and president of the International Rescue Committee (IRC).  ""It's a world dominated by impunity, where the guardrail stabilisers are not working and that's why there's so much disorder, not just in Ukraine and in Gaza and Israel, but more widely in places like Sudan, whose humanitarian crisis isn't even getting on the agenda,"" he said. This issue of impunity, one of the toughest of political challenges, was suddenly transformed into a poignant personal story when Navalny's wife, Yulia Navalnaya, unexpectedly appeared on the conference's main stage in the grand Bayerischer Hof hotel to condemn Russia's president and urge the assembled presidents, prime ministers, defence chiefs and top diplomats to bring him to justice.  Her remarkable composure and clarity stunned the packed hall, which gave her a sustained standing ovation before and after she spoke with palpable pain.  This year Russia, as well as Iran, weren't invited to Munich because the organisers assessed they weren't ""interested in meaningful dialogue"".  In MSC forums gone by, vitriolic speeches by Russia's veteran Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov angered and electrified the main hall, and Iran's visible presence highlighted the rivalries and risks in urgent need of resolution. The imperative of continuing hefty Western military and financial assistance to Ukraine was underscored repeatedly by Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, who exhorted participants to act, as he rushed from one high-level meeting to the next.  ""The year of 2024 demands your response - from everyone in the world,"" he beseeched delegates when he spoke from the top podium.  The US's pivotal support was uppermost in his mind as a vital security package, amounting to $60bn (£48bn), is being held up by a US Congress where Republican lawmakers are increasingly divided over whether to keep backing Kyiv in its fight.  Back home in Ukraine, soldiers are even running out of bullets on front lines. US delegates in Munich, including Vice-President Kamala Harris, were at pains to insist that she and President Joe Biden would not abandon Ukraine, nor America's leadership in global affairs. But with US elections just nine months away, Mr Trump is already shaping the polarised political debate in Washington and reviving anxiety that he could pull the US out of the Nato military alliance and other international commitments. ""They know what they need to do but they can't get it done, and that's the gap that has to be filled,"" was how Mr Miliband assessed pledges voiced by the US and European allies in Munich. Others were even more stinging in their criticism.  ""Lots of words. No concrete commitments,"" posted Nathalie Tocci, Director of the Institute of International Affairs, on X, formerly known as Twitter. ""It's a sad MSC2024."" The gaps were even more glaring when it came to the devastating Israel-Gaza war, which erupted after Hamas's murderous assault on southern Israel on 7 October.  Israel's military operations are causing a staggering number of civilian casualties and have ravaged much of this coastal strip. ""We have seen a really great interest from the international community and the world leaders who have gathered here in Munich that they would like to see a serious ceasefire and a substantial amount of international aid into Gaza,"" Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh remarked in an interview. But Israeli delegates, including former peace negotiator Tzipi Livni, doubled down on the need to keep pressing forward.   ""I'm a political opponent of [Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu, but I support the war in Gaza,"" she emphasised in a session, which also included Mr Shtayyeh and the Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi.  ""I support the strategic need to eliminate Hamas as a terrorist organisation and as a regime,"" Ms Livni said. This year's MSC marked a record attendance: more than 900 participants including some 50 heads of state and government from around the world, more than 100 ministers, as well as representatives of think-tanks, non-governmental organisations and leading businesses.  Top spooks, feminist foreign ministers, climate warriors, Iranian activists, weapons experts, technology wizards and more - all gathered for their own get-togethers on public stages and in private rendezvous and hushed huddles.   It all underlined how the world's understanding of ""global security"" keeps shifting shape. Over the decades, this forum - born in 1963 in a Cold War quest for peace and prosperity - has often been a venue for real-time diplomacy, too.  But in a year marked by worry over ""lose-lose dynamics"" Munich was a place for a lot of talking and taking stock as the world nervously wonders where the next blows will fall."
geopolitical tensions,Iran says president invited to visit Saudi Arabia,2024-09-15,2023-03-20,By Kathryn Armstrong,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-65010185,"Iran says Saudi Arabia has invited Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi for an official visit - just over a week since the countries agreed to restore diplomatic relations. The invitation is said to have come in a letter from King Salman, but has not yet been confirmed by the Saudis.  The Middle East's recent history has been dominated by hostility between the two nations. China brokered the thaw, which could reshape the region's geopolitics.  A senior Iranian official, Mohammad Jamshidi, tweeted about the invitation to visit the Saudi capital, Riyadh, saying Mr Raisi had welcomed it and ""stressed Iran's readiness to expand co-operation"".  Separately, Iran's Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian told reporters that the two countries had agreed to hold a meeting at foreign minister level, and that three possible locations had been proposed. He did not name the locations, nor say when the meeting might take place.  The BBC's Middle East Editor, Sebastian Usher, says the recent improvement in bilateral relations, which came unexpectedly following days of talks brokered by China, appears to be building serious momentum.  Both have announced they will reopen embassies within two months and re-establish trade and security relations. This development was cautiously welcomed by many, including the US and the United Nations, after previous attempts at reconciliation were unsuccessful.  Saudi Arabia cut ties in January 2016 after demonstrators stormed its embassy in Tehran. That was after Riyadh had executed the prominent Shia Muslim cleric Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr, who was convicted of terror-related offences.  Since then, tensions between the Sunni- and Shia-led neighbours have often been high, with each regarding the other as a threatening power seeking regional dominance.   They have been on opposing sides of several regional conflicts, including the civil wars in Syria and Yemen.  Mr Amir-Abdollahian also said that Iran hoped steps would be made to improve ties with Bahrain, a close Saudi ally that followed Riyadh in severing diplomatic ties with Tehran in 2016. ""We hope that some obstacles between Iran and Bahrain will be removed and we will take basic steps to reopen the embassies,"" he said. Bahrain has not responded to the comments, but earlier welcomed the Iran-Saudi agreement to restore diplomatic ties.  Iran has also expressed a willingness to resume or improve relations with other regional Arab rivals, including Jordan and the United Arab Emirates. "
geopolitical tensions,Taiwan votes in local elections amid China tensions,2024-09-15,2022-11-26,By Frances Mao,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-63739622,"Millions in Taiwan are heading to the polls as the island's local midterm elections kick off on Saturday.  Local council and city mayors are elected in the polls, which are held every four years.   But these elections are also drawing global attention this year as Taiwan becomes a bigger geopolitical flashpoint between China and the US. The Chinese government sees Taiwan as a breakaway province that will, eventually, be part of the country. But many Taiwanese people consider their self-ruled island - with its own form of government and a democratic system - to be distinct. This election also involves a referendum to lower the voting age to 18. Currently, only people above the age of 20 can vote. But more and more younger people appear to be becoming politically conscious, with turnout at the 2020 vote being the highest ever.  Young people have told the BBC they're directly being driven by the ""China threat"" - an issue that has been a big part of the political conversation throughout their lives.  There are two main political parties in Taiwan and they have differing approaches to China.  The Kuomintang (KMT), a party of conservative business champions, are traditionally seen as pro-China ""doves"". They have advocated for economic engagement with China and have appeared to be in favour of unification, though they have strongly denied being pro-China. Their main rival is the governing Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) whose leader Tsai Ing-wen won by a landslide in the 2020 national election. Ms Tsai has taken a strong stance towards China, saying Beijing needed to show Taiwan respect and that Taipei would not bow to pressure.   She was re-elected in 2020 on a promise to stand up to Beijing. Locals told the BBC at the time that protests in Hong Kong and Beijing's subsequent crackdown on civil rights had raised concerns in Taiwan.  ""The DPP is experiencing diminishing returns to its traditional brand of Taiwanese nationalism,"" says Wen-ti Sung, a Taiwan politics analyst in Taipei who works for the Australian National University. He says this year was full of national security events that should have been favourable to the DPP's ""rallying around the flag"" sentiment.  Those national security events refer to US House speaker Nancy Pelosi's controversial visit to Taiwan and China's massive military drills in response, the war in Ukraine and Chinese President Xi Jinping's commitment to make progress on cross-strait relations. ""Yet virtually all the polls indicate the DPP [is] failing to translate heightened nationalist sentiment into electoral support, unlike its big wins after the 2014 Sunflower Movement and 2020 presidential election post-Hong Kong crisis,"" he said. The government has claimed, ahead of the vote, that election meddling and interference from China was less than previously recorded. Taiwan has accused China of repeated efforts to influence voters - through online misinformation campaigns, military threats and even offering cheap flights to Taiwanese living in China. But Foreign Minister Joseph Wu said Chinese interference ""was not as prevailing as [in] previous elections"". He noted that Beijing might simply be ""very busy in dealing with its own domestic problems"", referring to China's soaring Covid cases. According to the polls, the mayoral race is quite close in Taipei and Hsinchu, Taiwan's Silicon Valley which is home to the country's world-leading semiconductor and microchip businesses. The races to watch out for are in six major cities, where 75% of the population live. In Taipei, the KMT's candidate is a man who says he's the great grand-son of Chiang Kai-shek, who ruled Taiwan for several decades in the 20th century. The family has rejected the claim but analysts point out that the KMT have often alluded to the link in their campaign. Hsinchu is also considered a bellwether, Dr Sung says. It's a three-way race for the mayorship, with the KMT and DPP candidates being challenged by a technocrat who is backed by the Taiwan People's Party and Terry Gou, the founder of technology manufacturing giant Foxconn.  The incumbent DPP sees winning Hsinchu as critical to maintaining its electoral support in northern Taiwan."
geopolitical tensions,The three men vying to be Taiwan's next president,2024-09-15,2024-01-04,By Kelly Ng,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-67758997,"On 13 January, Taiwan will elect a new president in a critical race that could redefine the island's relationship with China.  Beijing has long claimed self-governed Taiwan as a breakaway province and has loomed over the island's elections since the first one in 1996.  This year's race to replace sitting President Tsai Ing-wen is happening at a time when Taiwan has emerged as a key flashpoint between the US and China. Geopolitics aside, low wages and soaring home prices are among the domestic challenges weighing on voters.  On the ballot are the current vice-president from the governing Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), a former police chief who is running on the main opposition party Kuomintang or KMT's ticket, and an ex-Taipei mayor. The legislative elections, where each voter will cast one ballot for their district and another for at-large seats, will run on the same day. Here's more on the three presidential hopefuls and their running mates. He may be soft spoken, but Taiwan's 64-year-old vice-president is a staunch defender of the island's self-governing status - with China's state-run Global Times even calling for him to be prosecuted under Beijing's anti-secession laws.  During his tenure as President Tsai's premier from 2017 to 2019, Mr Lai described himself as a ""pragmatic worker for Taiwanese independence"".  Mr Lai's father died in an accident when he was two. Watching his mother raise six children by herself fostered a strong work ethic in Mr Lai, he says. He was medically trained in Harvard and worked as a renal doctor before he entered public service in Taiwan in the mid-1990s.  He first served as a lawmaker representing the southern city of Tainan. He was elected the city's mayor in 2010 and held on to the post in 2014 with an unprecedented 73% of the vote.  In his presidential campaign, Mr Lai has repeatedly said that Taiwan hopes to ""be friends"" with China. ""We don't want to be enemies. We can be friends. And we [would] love to see China... enjoy democracy and freedom, just like us,"" he told Bloomberg in August. Beijing, in turn, has called Mr Lai a ""troublemaker through and through"". But his running mate, Hsiao Bi-khim, appears to infuriate Beijing even more. She was born in Japan and mostly grew up in the US, cementing her links to Taiwan's strongest allies, which are also China's toughest diplomatic relationships. China has called Ms Hsiao a ""diehard Taiwan independence separatist"". Beijing has twice sanctioned the high-profile diplomat from entering mainland China and has also prohibited investors and firms related to her from working with organisations on the mainland. Ms Hsiao brings a wealth of foreign policy experience to Mr Lai's ticket. The 52-year-old served as Taiwan's representative to the US for the last three years. She was the first woman to take on this role. When it comes to statecraft, she calls herself a ""cat warrior"" - a retort to the combative ""wolf warrior"" style of diplomacy that Beijing encouraged until recently. ""Cats are much more lovable than wolves. In diplomacy, it's about making friends,"" she told The Economist last month. ""It's about making yourselves lovable."" As a child, Mr Hou supported his family's business by catching pigs or helping out at their pork stall in a local market. The 66-year-old once said the skills he developed while taking on pigs helped build his career as a policeman. He helped arrest high-profile murderers and was also a key investigator in the assassination attempt on ex-president Chen Shui-bian in 2004.  The former police chief turned to politics in 2010 and became mayor of New Taipei, Taiwan's most populous city, in 2018. He was re-elected in a landslide in 2022. Mr Hou's track record as a competent policeman and a popular mayor made him the KMT's top pick as it seeks to reclaim Taiwan's leadership after eight years. Mr Hou  had attempted to mount a joint ticket with another opposition candidate, Ko Wen-je, but that failed.  Mr Hou opposes Taiwan independence but has largely avoided voicing his stance on China in this campaign. This lack of clarity has drawn criticism. He dodged a question on the ""One-China"" policy - which recognises only one Chinese government, in Beijing - at a university forum in June 2023, calling into question his ability to manage dicey diplomacy. ""The relationship between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait is clear. We don't need to get it confused… It is completely based on the constitution of the Republic of China,"" he said then.  The KMT's vice-presidential nominee Jaw Shaw-kong is a well-known political commentator and one-time leader of the right-wing New Party. The 73-year-old is a long-time and outspoken supporter of the ""reunification"" of Taiwan and China - although he recently said this is not something he would pursue if elected given the substantial differences between the two sides. In 1991, Mr Jaw was appointed by the KMT-led government to serve as environment minister. Two years later, he co-founded the pro-unification New Party, which broke away from the KMT because its founders thought the KMT was not sufficiently pro-China. Mr Jaw withdrew from politics in 1996 and turned to a career in media. He is best-known for hosting a political talk show, aired by mainland-friendly broadcaster TVBS. In February 2021, Mr Jaw returned to politics. The quirky doctor-turned-politician - who once released a trippy rap video during his Taipei mayorship urging residents to ""do things right"" - brands himself as a ""third choice"" for voters between provoking and deferring to China.  Head of the Taiwan People's Party (TPP), Ko Wen-je proved popular among young voters. Once a prominent trauma surgeon, Mr Ko gave up his white coat for politics 10 years ago. The 64-year-old shot to political fame after throwing his support behind the ""Sunflower Movement"" in 2014, when students led protests against what they saw as China's growing influence over the island. Later that year, he was elected the mayor of Taipei. Despite being a political novice, he scored endorsements from Sunflower Movement activists and the DPP. Mr Ko's politics shifted during his eight-year mayorship. He expanded Taipei's relationship with mainland China, particularly with Shanghai's city government.  In 2019, he formed the TPP, branding it as the alternative to the DPP and KMT. The TPP won five out of 113 seats in the 2020 elections, making it the third-largest party in Taiwan's parliament. Known for his pithy style, Mr Ko has accused the DPP of endangering Taiwan by being ""pro-war"", while criticising the KMT for being ""too deferential"".  Mr Ko's running mate Cynthia Wu is a sitting MP and heiress to one of Taiwan's largest conglomerates, the Shin Kong Group. Some believe Ms Wu was picked because of her wealth. Born and educated in the US, the 45-year-old began her career as an investment analyst at Merrill Lynch in London before moving back to join the family business. She is currently the chief executive officer of the group's philanthropic arm. Analysts say both Mr Ko and Ms Wu are perceived as rich members of the elite and may face challenges connecting with the broader electorate, which is also voting on jobs and the economy."
geopolitical tensions,China vows consequences if Pelosi visits Taiwan,2024-09-15,2022-07-26,By Sam Cabral,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-62310576,"US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi's rumoured plan for a trip to Taiwan has infuriated China and left the White House with a serious geopolitical headache. How big a problem is this? China has warned of ""serious consequences"" if Ms Pelosi were to proceed with her visit. Second in line to the presidency, after the vice-president, Ms Pelosi would be the highest ranking US politician to travel to the island since 1997. This rankles China, which sees self-ruled Taiwan as a breakaway province that must become a part of the country. Beijing has not ruled out the possible use of force to achieve this. Even the Biden administration has reportedly tried to dissuade the California Democrat from going. Last week, President Joe Biden told reporters ""the military thinks it's not a good idea"", but his White House has called Chinese rhetoric against any such trip ""clearly unhelpful and not necessary"". The state department says Ms Pelosi has not announced any travel and the US approach to Taiwan remains unchanged. While the US maintains what it calls a ""robust, unofficial relationship"" with Taiwan, it has formal diplomatic ties with China, and not Taiwan. Ms Pelosi's trip, if it were to happen, also comes amid increased tensions between Washington and Beijing - and ahead of a much anticipated phone call between US President Joe Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping.  There is strong bipartisan support for Taiwan among the American public and in the US Congress. And over a congressional career spanning 35 years, Speaker Pelosi has been a vocal critic of China. She has denounced its human rights record, met with pro-democracy dissidents, and also visited Tiananmen Square to commemorate victims of the 1989 massacre. Ms Pelosi's original plan was to visit Taiwan in April, but it was postponed after she tested positive for Covid-19. She has declined to discuss details of the trip, but said last week that it was ""important for us to show support for Taiwan"". Beijing views Taiwan as its territory, and has repeatedly raised the spectre of annexing it by force if necessary. Chinese officials have expressed anger over what they view as growing diplomatic engagement between Taipei and Washington. This includes a surprise visit to the island by six US lawmakers in April. On Monday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian warned his country would take ""firm and resolute measures"" if Ms Pelosi went ahead with her visit. ""And the US will be responsible for all of the serious consequences,"" he said. A spokesman of the Chinese ministry of defence seemed to suggest there could even be a military response. ""If the US side insists on going ahead, the Chinese military will never sit idle and will take strong measures to thwart any external interference and separatist attempts for 'Taiwan independence',"" Colonel Tan Kefei told China Daily. Rupert Wingfield-Hayes. BBC News, Taipei If you are a small island state with few allies, not recognised by the United Nations, and threatened with invasion by a much larger and more powerful neighbour, then getting a visit by the third most powerful politician in the United States should be something you welcome. Right? That's why the Taiwanese government is not about to tell the US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to stay away.  Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen has long called for higher level engagement with the US. But there is also concern about why Ms Pelosi is coming now, and whether her trip could do more harm than good.  Three times in the last year President Joe Biden has said the US would intervene to support Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion, only to have his staff roll back his remarks - insisting there is no change in US policy.  When news of Ms Pelosi's trip to Taiwan was leaked, President Biden's response was not to give his support - but instead to say, ""the department of defence thinks it's not a good idea"".  In Beijing this looks like weakness. In Taipei it looks like confusion.  What exactly is the US government policy towards the island?  Ms Pelosi is now 82 and expected to retire in the autumn. Is she coming here with a clear intent to offer real support, or is it a political stunt?  It's all very unclear.  At its party congress, expected later this year, the Chinese Communist Party is set to select Mr Xi to an unprecedented third term as the country's leader. President Biden - who last spoke with President Xi in March - has said they will speak over the phone again in the next few days, on a range of topics including Taiwan and other ""issues of tension"". The call comes as US officials warn of a Chinese military build-up in the Asia-Pacific region and ""aggressive and irresponsible behaviour"" in the South China Sea. The threats of retaliation over Ms Pelosi's visit have raised concerns over China's possible response. When then-US Health Secretary Alex Azar flew to Taiwan in 2020, Chinese air force jets crossed over the mid-line of the Taiwan Strait - the narrow waterway between the island and its giant neighbour - within range of Taipei's missiles. Last week, the former editor of China's state-run Global Times newspaper suggested a ""shocking military response"" may be in store for Ms Pelosi. ""If Pelosi visits Taiwan, [People's Liberation Army] military aircraft will accompany Pelosi's plane to enter the island, making a historic crossing of the island by military aircraft from mainland for the 1st time,"" Hu Xijin wrote. Until now, Washington's policy of ""strategic ambiguity"" has meant the US has been deliberately unclear about whether or how it would defend Taiwan in the event of a large scale attack on the island."
geopolitical tensions,The Taiwan-sized problem for the next US president,2024-09-15,2020-10-28,By Rupert Wingfield-Hayes,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-54655277,"Is China preparing to invade Taiwan? It's a question being discussed with feverish intensity on many China forums right now. And what should be one of the top geopolitical concerns for the incoming US president. The temperature was raised further on 13 October when China's President Xi Jinping visited a People's Liberation Army (PLA) Marine Corp base in southern Guangdong province and told the marines there to ""prepare for war"".  In response some newspapers ran headlines suggesting an invasion is imminent.  It almost certainly isn't. But there are good reasons for the urgency with which China experts are now discussing the future of Taiwan. China and the United States have long stared at each other across Taiwan. Beijing insists the island of 23 million people is China's ""inviolable territory"".  Washington says any resolution of their long separation must be done peacefully.  For decades, the uneasy stalemate has continued. Until now.  There are several reasons the status quo no longer looks tenable. The first is Xi Jinping.   ""Xi Jinping wants Taiwan back,"" says Professor Steve Tsang, director of the China Institute at London's School of Oriental and African Studies. ""And Xi Jinping wants to have Taiwan back before he hands over power to whoever comes next.""  Oriana Skylar Mastro, a China military analyst at Stanford University, says her wakeup call on Taiwan came when Xi Jinping forced through the abolition of presidential term limits in 2018, effectively making himself president for life.  ""Suddenly everything he said about Taiwan took on a whole different meaning,"" she says. ""The timeline of when he said he wanted this issue resolved is now tied to his legitimacy as leader and his tenure as a leader.""  Prof Tsang says Xi Jinping views himself as a great historical figure, with a mission to complete what China's previous paramount leaders, including Mao himself, could not.  ""Deng Xiaoping could not get Taiwan,"" he explains. ""Even Chairman Mao couldn't get Taiwan. And if Xi Jinping gets Taiwan, (he) is greater not only than Deng Xiaoping, but Mao Zedong."" Xi Jinping has stated publicly that Taiwan reunification is an ""inevitable requirement for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese people"". The timetable for completion of his ""great rejuvenation"" project is 2049, the 100th anniversary of the communist revolution. That is nearly 30 years away.  But there is reason to think Xi is in more of a hurry.   The first is that China may soon have the military capability to defeat the United States in a war over Taiwan.  ""For the past 20 years, the main question that most people ask is, will the United States defend its allies and partners?"" says Ms Mastro. ""It was a question of resolve. Will the United States come to Taiwan's aid? But as the Chinese military becomes more advanced, the question has shifted from will they, to can they?"" The transformation of China's military from a low-tech ""People's Army"" to a modern high-tech military, has happened much faster than many had predicted.  The speed and scale of the change was brought home during the huge 70th anniversary parade in Beijing on 1 October last year.  Among the familiar paraphernalia of tanks, artillery and rocket launchers were some very striking new weapons systems, including stealth jets and stealth drones, and so-called ""hypersonic glide vehicles"". These new systems are designed to strike at US aircraft carrier battle groups, should they try to intervene to protect Taiwan.  Captain James E. Fanell was the director of US Naval Intelligence for the US Pacific fleet until his retirement in 2015.  ""I've characterised what I called a decade of concern,"" he tells me from his new job at the Geneva Centre for Security Policy, ""which is right now 2020 to 2030, which I think is the most dangerous time. Both (former President) Hu Jintao and Xi (Jinping) ordered the PLA to have the capability to be able to take Taiwan militarily by about 2020. ""So, they've been working for the last 20 years on orders to have the capacity and capabilities to launch a military invasion against Taiwan."" China has also been gradually testing America's resolve, seeing how far it can go before the US responds to threats against an ally.  According to Capt Fanell, the US has repeatedly failed those tests, allowing China to take control of Scarborough Shoal off the coast of the Philippines in 2012, and then doing nothing to stop China building a series of huge new artificial island bases across the South China Sea.  ""What happened at Scarborough Shoal from April to June 2012 is America's biggest foreign policy failure in Asia since our helicopters took off from the roofs of those embassy buildings in Saigon in 1975,"" he says, referring to the US military defeat in the Vietnam War. ""It was a disaster and it really had a debilitating impact on America's national credibility in Asia when we didn't do anything to defend the Philippines."" Taiwan is not only about getting back China's so-called ""lost territories"". Control of the island would give Beijing what General Douglas MacArthur once called an ""unsinkable aircraft carrier in the Pacific"". Ms Mastro says a Chinese victory over Taiwan would completely re-draw the strategic map of Asia.  ""If China does fight a war over Taiwan and wins, not only do they get to reunify with Taiwan, but that's basically the end of the role of the United States as a leader in Asia as we know it,"" she explains. ""So, there are many benefits, actually, from the Chinese perspective."" In Washington there is now bipartisan recognition that the threat to Taiwan is growing. In a clear signal to China, the Trump administration has approved billions in arms sales to Taiwan, including, for the first time, advanced air-to-ground missiles.  But it is still far from clear what the United States would do if Taiwan were attacked. Capt Fanell says that is a mistake.  ""We know from history, we know the lack of support to the Kuwaiti government indicated to Saddam that he had a free rein to go into Kuwait,"" he explains. ""We know from the Korean War, statements that were equivocal gave China and Russia this idea that it was OK to attack in the Korean peninsula. If we don't make some definitive statements about who our friends and allies are and what lengths we'll go to defend them, then we leave them at risk.""  But Prof Tsang says there is also a lesson for Xi Jinping from those past conflicts. Belatedly, America did come to the aid of the Republic of Korea, and Kuwait. He says China would do well not to underestimate US military resolve once provoked.  ""The spirit of the United States military is one that will fight and fight and fight,"" he explains. ""If the Chinese take that into account, I think they may be a bit more cautious in their calculations and the risk of miscalculation may be reduced.""  If you add anger and suspicion over Covid-19 to the trade war, the Huawei investigation, the mutual closing of consulates and the ejection of journalists, relations between Washington and Beijing are at their lowest since the 1989 Tiananmen massacre.  There are voices on both sides calling on the next US president to drop the hostility and return to engagement with China. But the consensus among those I have spoken to is that the old type of engagement has failed.  They say the next US president must find a new type of engagement, more honest, more robust, and where the US is much clearer about its obligations and intentions, towards its allies in Asia, including Taiwan.

geopolitical tensions,Taiwan unveils new submarine to fend off China,2024-09-15,2023-09-28,By Tessa Wong,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-66932808,"Taiwan has unveiled its first domestically-made submarine as it bolsters its defences against a possible Chinese attack. President Tsai Ing-wen presided over the launch ceremony in the port city of Kaohsiung on Thursday. US officials have warned that China could be militarily capable of mounting an invasion within the next few years. Taiwan is a self-governing island which China regards as a renegade province and has vowed to reclaim one day. Most observers believe China will not attack the island imminently, and Beijing has said it seeks peaceful ""reunification"" with Taiwan. But at the same time it has warned against Taiwan formally declaring independence and any foreign support. It has increasingly sought to put pressure on the island with its military drills in the Taiwan Strait, including several conducted this month.   ""History will forever remember this day,"" said Ms Tsai as she stood in front of the towering submarine draped in the emblem of Taiwan's flag.  She added that the idea of a domestically-made submarine had previously been considered ""an impossible task… but we did it"".  Building their own submarines has long been a key priority for Taiwan's leaders, but the programme accelerated under Ms Tsai who has revved up military spending to nearly double its budget during her tenure. The $1.54bn (£1.27bn) diesel-electric powered submarine will undergo several tests and will be delivered to the navy by the end of 2024, according to military officials.  It has been named the Haikun after a mythical massive fish that can also fly, which appears in classic Chinese literature. Another one is currently in production. Taiwan aims to eventually operate a fleet of 10 submarines - including two older Dutch-made boats - and equip them with missiles. The head of the domestic submarine programme Admiral Huang Shu-kuang told reporters last week that the goal was to fend off any attempt from China to encircle Taiwan for an invasion or impose a naval blockade. It would also buy time until US and Japan forces arrive to aid Taiwan's defence, he added.  When asked by reporters about the submarine on Thursday, a Chinese defence ministry spokesperson said it was ""idiotic nonsense"" to try to stop their military's actions in the Pacific. ""No amount of weapons [Taiwan's ruling] Democratic Progressive Party buys or makes can stop reunification with the motherland,"" he added. In a piece published earlier this week, state media outlet Global Times said Taiwan was ""daydreaming"" and the plan was ""just an illusion"".   It also claimed China's military ""has already constructed a multidimensional anti-submarine network all around the island"". Observers agree that the new submarines could help boost Taiwan's defence. Taiwan's 10-submarine fleet would pale in comparison to China's, said to currently comprise more than 60 boats including nuclear-powered attack submarines, with more on the way. But the island has long pursued an asymmetric warfare strategy where it aims to build a more agile defence force to face down a larger and well-resourced enemy. The submarines could ""aid Taiwan's relatively small navy in taking initiative against China's mighty navy"" by conducting ""guerrilla style warfare with their stealth, lethality and surprise capabilities"", noted William Chung, a military researcher with the Institute for National Defense and Security Research in Taiwan. In particular, he said, they could help guard the various straits and channels that link the so-called ""first island chain"", a network of islands including Taiwan, Philippines and Japan seen as a possible battlefront for any conflict with China. Anti-submarine warfare remains the Chinese navy's ""weakest part, and this is the chance for Taiwan to exploit it"", he added. But the ""centre of gravity"" for any China-Taiwan naval conflict would not likely be in the deep waters off the island's east coast, where submarines would be most effective in, pointed out Drew Thompson, a visiting senior research fellow at the National University of Singapore and former US Department of Defense official.  Instead, the main theatre of war would be in the shallower waters of the west coast facing mainland China.  ""The submarine is not optimised for a counter invasion role... having this increased capability to complicate China's military operations would have an effect, but it's not a decisive one,"" he said. Their effectiveness would largely depend on how Taiwan chooses to deploy them.  Beyond playing a deterrent role they could also be used to ambush Chinese ships; carry out mine-laying operations in Chinese ports; disrupt maritime oil supplies; and destroy key facilities on the Chinese coastline, according to Chieh Chung, a defence researcher with Taiwanese think tank National Policy Foundation. What is more significant, however, is that Taiwan managed to design and build its own submarine in the first place. The Haikun uses a combat system by US defence company Lockheed Martin and will carry US-made torpedoes. While this may be no surprise given that the US is Taiwan's chief ally, at least six other countries including the UK came to Taiwan's aid in supplying components, technology and talent, according to a Reuters report. Adm Huang told Nikkei Asia he had personally approached military contacts in the US, Japan, South Korea and India for help but did not specify which country eventually agreed. The fact that several countries and companies were ""not afraid to supply parts to a marquee defence programme in Taiwan... indicates a significant geopolitical shift"", noted Mr Thompson. It is an indicator of the ""doubt and dissatisfaction"" with Beijing felt by some members of the international community, and ""should cause China to feel disquiet"", added Mr Chieh.  The launch comes a day after Beijing confirmed it had been conducting military drills this month to ""resolutely combat the arrogance of Taiwan independence separatist forces"". In recent weeks it had once again ramped up its warship presence in the Taiwan Strait and military jet incursions into airspace around the island.  US military and intelligence officials have given varying timelines for a possible Chinese invasion.  One date put forth recently is 2027 - Chinese President Xi Jinping is believed to have told his military to be operationally capable of mounting an invasion by that year. But CIA director William Burns also said it did not necessarily mean Mr Xi would decide to invade then as he is thought to have doubts over whether China would succeed."
geopolitical tensions,Russia country profile,2024-09-15,2012-04-26,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-17839672,"Russia - the largest country on earth - emerged from a decade of post-Soviet economic and political turmoil to seek to reassert itself as a world power. Income from vast natural resources, above all oil and gas, helped Russia overcome the economic collapse of 1998, but the oil price slump of 2014 ended the long run of prosperity.  Vladimir Putin has been Russia's dominant political figure since his election as president in 2000, serving two terms and then a four-year stint as prime minister, before resuming the presidency in 2012 and winning re-elections in 2018 and 2024. Putin has enhanced his control over state institutions and the media, a process supplemented more recently by an emphasis on fierce nationalism and hostility to the West. The mid-2010s onwards have seen a dramatic downturn in Russian relations with the West, with some considering it the start of a new Cold War.  In 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine in an attempt to re-assert Russian control over the neighbouring country, the largest conventional war in Europe since 1945. It is estimated to have caused tens of thousands of Ukrainian civilian casualties and hundreds of thousands of military casualties. In 2023, the Kremlin unveiled an anti-Western foreign policy strategy, defining Russia as a ""unique country-civilization and a vast Eurasian and Euro-Pacific power"" seeking closer relations with China, India, the Islamic world, Latin America and southern Africa, in opposition to the US and its allies.

Alexi Navalny, who was President Putin's fiercest domestic critic, died in an Arctic penal colony in 2024.  Putin has adopted a stridently nationalist course and appealed to memories of Soviet-era power to shore up domestic support. Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Putin has pursued an ideological campaign on the domestic front - pushing for a transformation of Russia into an increasingly militaristic society.   The president presents himself as a strong leader who took Russia out of the economic, social and political crisis of the 1990s, and defends Russia's national interests, particularly against alleged Western hostility.  Since the start of the invasion of Ukraine in 2022 nearly all independent media outlets in Russia have shut down, been forced to close, or have left the country to operate from exile.  Top state-controlled domestic TV channels have cleared their schedules for current affairs programmes spreading anti-Ukrainian, anti-Western material.

The IMF warned that if the West imposed financial sanctions on Iran, it would be tantamount to an oil blockade, and the shock to the market could be as bad as from Libya's revolution last year. Iran produces 5% of global oil output. Moreover, if Iran goes ahead with a threat to blockade oil exports via the Straits of Hormuz in the Gulf, the IMF said the shock could be even greater. About a quarter of all oil produced globally, and some 40% of all oil exports - including those from Iraq, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia - are shipped through the Straits each year. ""A blockade of the Strait of Hormuz would constitute, and be perceived by markets to presage, sharply heightened global geopolitical tension involving a much larger and unprecedented disruption,"" the Fund said in a regular note to the Group of 20 leading industrialised countries, external. The market is already pricing in a small risk of an escalation of tensions between Iran on the one hand, and the US, Europe and Israel on the other, according to the IMF's estimates. Western countries have been threatening sanctions if Iran does not halt its nuclear programme, which they maintain is being used to develop weapons. The fund warned that the impact on oil prices of either scenario would be accentuated by the current tightness of oil supplies. The oil stockpiles of major oil consuming countries are lower than usual, while the big oil exporting countries have limited short-term ability to increase supply, the IMF said. Iran is the world's fifth-largest oil producer, extracting 3.5 million barrels a day. Other members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) have some 3.8 million barrels in spare capacity that could eventually be made available. However, in the case of an oil blockade by Iran, access to oil supplies from other major Opec countries - including crucially Saudi Arabia - would also be cut off.

geopolitical tensions,Case of US sailor stirs unease over Japan military ties,2024-09-15,2024-02-18,Nicholas Yong & Ian Tang ,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-68137582,"When the story of Ridge Alkonis first broke on 29 May 2021, it did not initially attract much attention in Japan.  The US Navy officer had killed two Japanese citizens in a car accident during a trip to Mount Fuji - the victims were an 85-year-old woman and her son-in-law, aged 54. After pleading guilty to negligent driving, Alkonis was sentenced to three years jail in October 2021. In his defence, US Navy doctors said he had been suffering from acute mountain sickness at the time of the accident. He was transferred to US custody last December.  Alkonis, stationed at the Yokosuka naval base south of Tokyo, was just the latest American serviceman to run into legal troubles. Since the US-Japan Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) was inked in 1960 - enabling the deployment of US military forces in the country - there have been hundreds of criminal cases involving US military personnel.  Then on 13 January, a celebratory tweet by CNN anchor Jake Tapper - accompanied by a photo of a smiling Alkonis, 36, with his wife and three children - about ""great and breaking news"" jolted the Japanese public. Tapper wrote: ""This morning the US parole commission ordered the full parole and immediate release with no supervision of Navy Lt Ridge Alkonis.""  Few in Japan knew that Alkonis' wife Brittany and his advocates had led a successful pressure campaign in the United States for his release. US President Joe Biden embraced Brittany Alkonis at the 2022 State of the Union address, while Vice-President Kamala Harris raised the case with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida. Utah senator Mike Lee also actively lobbied for Alkonis, tagging Mr Kishida in multiple tweets. Upon his release, he even tweeted: ""Japan owes the family - and the US - an apology.""  The online outrage in Japan was pronounced. ""Why are you celebrating?"" asked one.  Another wrote in response to Mr Lee's tweet: ""Did he and his family apologise (to) the families of those Japanese victims in the first place?"" Alkonis had, in fact, apologised and paid a monetary settlement to the family of the victims in a separate civil case prior to his sentencing, according to US military newspaper Stars and Stripes. Despite the public anger and some coverage in Japanese media, neither government has commented publicly on the case. Prof James D Brown of Temple University told the BBC that there is little incentive for Japanese politicians or mainstream media to amplify the case. ""To do so would be to aggravate the damage to US-Japan relations at a time when there is widespread recognition in Japan that, despite its iniquities, the alliance with the United States remains essential to Japan's security,"" he said, adding that such cases are ""unquestionably damaging"". Despite the ""clear frustration"" over the outcome of the Alkonis case, Jeffrey Hall of the Kanda University of International Studies added: ""There is a sense of resignation among many Japanese that their powerful American allies do not treat them as equals and never will. The Alkonis incident underlines that even when parties and presidents change in the United States, this sense of inequality persists."" The simmering resentment over the American military presence in Japan is a long-running theme that dates back to the post-World War Two military occupation of Japan. At the end of the war, the American occupiers rewrote Japan's constitution to a pacifist one and reduced the Emperor to a symbolic figurehead. There are roughly 54,000 US servicemen stationed at 120 bases across Japan, 32 of which are in Okinawa alone. The prefecture also hosts almost 30,000 troops, while its proximity to Taiwan makes it vital in terms of the US being able to respond to any Chinese invasion of the self-ruling island. Nowhere in Japan is the discontent over the US military presence clearer than in Okinawa, where the American occupation only ended in 1972 - two decades after the rest of Japan. The 1970 Koza riot, in which thousands of Okinawans clashed with military police, is even commemorated in a museum.  Retiree Takashi Asato, 70, has vivid memories of life as a child in 1960s Okinawa, with fighter jets constantly flying overhead and tanks and military trucks blocking the road. ""Most of the beautiful sandy beaches were for the exclusive use of the US military - no entry permitted to locals. Foreign residences were surrounded by fences and had large grassy yards for the families of US military personnel.""  Mr Asato, who often ferried US troops to bases as a bus driver, added: ""There were many complicated economic and cultural relationships between Okinawans and US troops, but it was a mutually beneficial relationship.""  A public opinion poll conducted last year revealed that 70% of Okinawan residents feel the concentration of US bases there is ""unfair"". And despite a vocal anti-base movement, which often stages protests asking for their removal, that same poll indicates that more young people are resigned to the US military presence. However, many are concerned about the noise and environmental pollution caused by military deployments. Drunken incidents involving US servicemen are common, while sexual violence against women has also occurred. Few have forgotten the infamous 1995 incident where three servicemen raped a 12-year-old Okinawan girl, sparking months-long protests. When such incidents occur, US bases are often temporarily shut down to prevent contact with locals, so as not to further aggravate tensions. Senior US military leaders will also meet the governor to apologise. When asked about the Alkonis case, university student Yui Tamura, 24, told the BBC that she found Tapper's tweet ""extremely shocking"". But she shares Mr Asato's view that the bases are ""inevitable"".  She added: ""However, when fighter jets fly by with such loud noise that the air shakes, and when the precious ocean is reclaimed to build new bases, I feel like the people of Okinawa are being ignored."" The perennial threat of North Korea, together with an increasingly assertive China and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, means the US bases are not going away. It has also resulted in what was once unthinkable: Japan's largest military build-up since World War Two, with a two-fold increase in defence spending.  Its pacifist constitution has even been reinterpreted to allow its Self Defence Forces (SDF) to assist the forces of a foreign country in situations where either the survival and security of Japan or that of its citizens is at risk. Notwithstanding the unhappiness of many Japanese, the US therefore remains ""irreplaceable"" as Japan's core ally, said Prof Brown.  Prof Hall reckons that the US-Japan alliance is stronger than ever. ""The security situation surrounding Japan is so serious that Japan's leaders would prefer to ignore (issues like Alkonis) and keep moving forward with plans to increase military co-operation with the United States and other like-minded states. "" But Prof Brown warns that such cases may eventually take a toll. ""Those opposed to the Japan-US alliance, including North Korea, China, and Russia, must be delighted whenever the United States acts with such arrogant indifference to their ally's concerns. It's a gift to the US's and Japan's adversaries."" This story was updated on 4 June 2024 to reflect that Alkonis had apologised to the family of the victims. "
geopolitical tensions,Warning public debt could soar as population ages,2024-09-15,2023-07-13,Daniel Thomas & Tom Espiner,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-66187743,"The UK's public debt could soar as the population ages and tax receipts fall, the government's independent forecaster has warned.  The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) said debt could rise to more than 300% of the size of the economy by 2070, up from around 100% currently.  Climate change and geopolitical tensions also posed ""significant"" risks to government finances, it added. But it called current government plans to reduce debt ""relatively modest"". It comes as separate figures show the UK economy has barely grown since 2019 before the pandemic.  Commenting on the OBR report, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said the government would take ""difficult but responsible"" decisions on the public finances. Public debt is the stockpile of money borrowed by the government over the years to fund its spending.  Mr Hunt has set a target of getting underlying debt to fall in five years' time.  In a report, the OBR said the 2020s were turning out to be a ""very risky era for the public finances"".  It said the pandemic, cost-of-living crisis and recent interest rate rises had hit the economy and driven up government borrowing costs. As a result, it said: From this ""vulnerable position"", it said, the government now faced growing costs from an ageing society.  This will drive up pension spending in the short term, and by 2070 shrink the ratio of working age people to retired people.  ""This puts downward pressure on tax receipts, upward pressure on primary spending, and leaves a growing gap between the two,"" the OBR said.  The forecasting body said that the government's debt interest costs were also set to surge. And it said borrowing would rise as government spending on defence increased to meet ""growing security threats in Europe and Asia"".  Decarbonising the economy to reach net zero by 2050 would also cost the government billions in extra spending, it said.  All of these factors could lead to the size of the UK's debt compared to the size of the economy - as measured by the debt-to-GDP ratio - tripling over the next 50 years, the OBR said. It added that unforeseen shocks or unfunded policies could drive it even higher.  The OBR added that the government's current plan for stabilising and then reducing debt - as a share of GDP by 2027-28 - was ""relatively modest by historical and international standards"". Commenting, Mr Hunt said the government would take ""difficult but responsible decisions on the public finances, including public sector pay, because more borrowing is itself inflationary"". But Rachel Reeves, Labour's shadow chancellor, said the OBR's report showed ""just how far we are falling behind our peers"". ""There are serious decisions to be made by this Tory government to restore some security in our economy, to get a grip on inflation, and to stop people's bills rising."" The OBR's report also warned gas prices are expected to remain high until at least 2025. Soaring oil and gas prices have contributed to the rapid pace of general price rises, putting struggling households under pressure. After a massive 13-fold price jump in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, gas prices have fallen back - but are still more than twice as expensive as before. The OBR said the hike in gas prices had made renewable energy cheaper than gas over its life-time for the first time. However, despite this, it said there was ""little sign of a step-change in renewable energy investment in the UK"". Planned UK government investments in green technologies will not get the country to net zero carbon emissions by 2050, the OBR said."
geopolitical tensions,The flashing warning sign that is worrying investors,2024-09-15,2023-11-01,Daniel Thomas,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-67262339,"It's not something your friends are likely to be talking about down the pub but in the City there's something fund managers and investors are increasingly worried about. Bond markets.  They are falling and have been for some time.  It is a flashing warning sign about the state of the UK and US economies and may affect the costs of our loans and mortgages.  So how worried should we be? Governments borrow money by selling financial products called bonds. A bond is a promise to pay money in the future. Most require the borrower to make regular interest payments over the bond's lifetime. UK government bonds - known as gilts - are normally considered very safe investments, with little risk the money will not be repaid. US government bonds - known as Treasuries - are also considered very safe.  Over the last year or so, there has been a sell-off of government bonds on global markets that is having wider ramifications.  It comes as central banks warn that inflation - the rate at which prices rise - is likely to stay higher for longer than previously expected.  Since 2021, central banks have repeatedly put up interest rates to try to tame inflation, lifting them from close to zero to where they are now: 5.25% in the UK and 5.25%-5.50% in the US.  And when official rates rise, the yields on government bonds also tend to go up to attract buyers, driving up borrowing costs for governments and consumers in the process.  Yields on benchmark 10-year US Treasuries topped 5% in October - their highest level since just before the 2007 financial crisis. In the UK, 30-year gilt yields hit a 25-year high of 5.115% earlier in the month, with similar moves seen elsewhere in Europe.  As yields rise, investors tend to dump the older bonds they currently hold in favour of newly issued ones that pay higher rates.  As a result, bond prices tend to fall which affects anyone who owns these assets - hence the flashing lights we are seeing in the markets.   Government bond yields are used as a guide for setting the rates on everyday loans and mortgages, which have shot up over the last few years. Average US mortgage rates hit a two-decade high of 8% last month, squeezing borrowers. In the UK, the rate on an average five-year fixed residential deal was 5.87% as on 31 October, down slightly from levels seen earlier this year but still high compared with a few years ago. Rising bond yields are also putting pressure on governments.  That's because the higher yields go, the more governments have to pay back in debt interest, which may leave them with less to spend on other things. It is likely to impact whichever party wins the UK general election tipped for next year, says Simon French, a managing director at investment bank Panmure Gordon. ""The higher bond rates go, the more interest that has to be repaid, the less there is for public services such as health and education,"" he says.  That is highly unlikely, says Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. The UK has never defaulted on its debts (although in 1672 England did so) nor has the US. However, he says investors are feeling slightly more nervous about the ""manageability"" of these countries' debts after years of heavy government spending on things like the 2007-08 financial crisis, the Covid pandemic and the Ukraine war. America's total debt stands at $33.6 trillion (£27.6tn) - up from $9tn in 2007. In the UK it's risen to £2.5tn from £700bn over that time. The more debt interest countries have to pay, the harder, theoretically, it may be for them to repay what they owe investors.  The immediate risk is from the sharp fall in bond prices, which is bad news for investors and companies that hold these normally stable assets as collateral on their balance sheets. Earlier this year, Silicon Valley Bank imploded after the value of bonds it held on its balance sheet collapsed. And some UK pension funds got into difficulties when the government's mini-budget sparked turmoil on UK bond markets in 2022, forcing the Bank of England to step in.  Mr French expects we'll see more ""unanticipated fallout"" as the bond sell-off continues but it won't become a systemic risk to the global economy.  ""We are certainly not in the territory of 2008-09 or at the start of the pandemic when there was proper fear out there. But there is worry.""  The Bank of England and the US Federal Reserve both think a recession can be avoided in their respective countries.  But Mr Mould doesn't rule it out, adding that markets fear ""we will end up with painful government debt or painful inflation"" over the next few years.  The hope, he says, is that the UK and US central banks will steer their respective economies towards a ""soft landing"" by bringing down inflation without hurting the economy. ""They got us through Covid and the energy price shock, and markets are hoping they can do it again."" The big unknown is whether rising geopolitical tensions will spill over and make a bad situation worse.  Russia's invasion of Ukraine hit economies around the world as global energy prices spiked and governments were forced to intervene to help households.  Now, Middle East tensions are rising as Israel expands ground operations in Gaza following the 7 October Hamas attacks that killed 1,400 Israelis with 239 people kidnapped as hostages. Thousands of Palestinians have also been killed.  Meanwhile, an attack on Taiwan by China remains a real possibility. Such events could cause even more economic disruption."
geopolitical tensions,How other countries are dealing with the energy crisis,2024-09-15,2022-01-30,Robert Plummer,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60112068,"Household gas and electricity bills are going up across Europe as the continent's energy crisis bites. Soaring global prices of natural gas, which is used to heat homes and generate electricity, have caught governments on the hop. In the UK, for example, a number of measures have been suggested, such as support with fuel bills for those on lower incomes. While all countries are facing the same problem, some have acted more decisively than others.  French President Emmanuel Macron has still not officially declared that he is running for a second term in April, but he clearly doesn't want discontent over energy bills to spoil his chances of re-election. With newspapers constantly headlining the ""flambée des prix de l'énergie"" (soaring energy prices), the French government has stepped in to keep costs down. Regulated gas prices went up by 12.6% in October last year and have been frozen until April. But a rise in electricity prices, planned for next month, has been limited to just 4%. Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Monday that if he had not intervened, prices would be going up by a whopping 45%. In addition, 5.8 million lower-income households received a €100 (£83) ""chèque énergie"" through the post last month to help them with their bills. There's no doubt that if not for these measures, the French would have taken to the streets to express their discontent.  With the memory of the ""gilets jaunes"" protest movement still fresh in their minds, the last thing ministers want is to offer up a fresh pretext for social unrest. But there has been some flak from other quarters, with Mr Le Maire accused of ""killing off"" the 85% state-owned electricity giant EDF. EDF is bearing the brunt of the government's intervention, by being forced to sell more of its electricity to competitors at a lower price. The firm says this will cost it €8bn this year. But Mr Le Maire is unrepentant, saying EDF is a public service and must act in the public interest ""to protect the French"". Danes could also face big increases in energy bills this year, with prices going up by anywhere between 20% and 200% for many households. But after pressure in parliament, the government has promised to intervene.  Around 440,000 struggling families will be entitled to a tax-free cheque from the government to help them cover their costs, Minister of Climate, Energy and Supply Dan Jørgensen said on Thursday.  They will include people with gas boilers and a smaller number whose homes are heated with hot water directly from power plants (known  in Denmark as the ""district heating"" system). ""We propose that we put together a heating cheque for Danes who are hardest hit - specifically, that means people who have individual gas heating or live in district heating areas where the district heating supply relies on gas,"" Mr Jørgensen told Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten. The proposal still needs to be approved by parliament and the amount is as yet unspecified, although it's expected to be in the thousands of kroner (1,000 kroner roughly equals £112). Only those on incomes below a certain threshold will be entitled and the cash will be paid automatically into people's bank accounts, so they won't have to apply.  France's EDF runs 56 nuclear reactors which generate just over 70% of the country's electricity. But in Germany, nuclear energy has been all but phased out.  Anyone who spent time in Germany in the 1980s will remember the ""Atomkraft? Nein danke"" (Nuclear power? No thanks) stickers that were omnipresent at the time. Anti-nuclear policy was a founding tenet of the German Green party, which is now back in the German governing coalition after 16 years in opposition. But it wasn't the Greens that killed off nuclear power in Germany. That was the work of former Chancellor Angela Merkel, who decided after Japan's Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011 that it was time to shut the plants down. The change came as part of what is known as the Energiewende (energy turnaround), which has seen Germany rely heavily on renewable energy. But whatever the rights and wrongs of that decision, it has left Germany with some of the highest power prices in Europe. A government renewable energy surcharge accounts for one-fifth of a typical household's electricity bill. It's designed to subsidise renewable power producers, who are guaranteed a fixed price for the next 20 years, at consumers' expense. As a result, private consumers pay more than a third of Germany's power bill, while using less than a quarter of the energy. Despite all this, German power generation is in some ways less clean than in the UK. For example, only about 1% of the UK's electricity is still generated by coal. In Germany, it's more than a quarter. Germany has pledged to get rid of coal by 2038. But it's hardly surprising that many of the country's former anti-nuclear protesters have switched to being anti-coal protesters instead. As for gas, Germany relies on Russia for most of its imports - but last year, gas made up only about 15% of Germany's energy mix. The government said it is working on ""solutions for households that are now facing difficulties"" because of spiralling prices, also expressing a preference for helping those on tighter budgets. There's been much coverage of tensions between Russia and Ukraine in terms of their effect on European gas supplies. But Spain's energy problems are being exacerbated by a different set of geopolitical issues. More than half of Spanish gas supplies are sourced from Algeria. Until recently, the gas came via the Maghreb-Europe pipeline, which has linked the two countries since 1996. But that pipeline also runs through Algeria's neighbour, Morocco, which is embroiled in diplomatic rows with both Madrid and Algiers. Spain's relations with Morocco have worsened after a massive influx of Moroccan migrants into Spain's north African enclave of Ceuta. At the same time, Algeria cut off diplomatic ties with Morocco after a series of disagreements. With the Maghreb-Europe pipeline no longer in use, Algeria is now supplying Spain via the Medgaz pipeline, which does not go through Moroccan territory. However, it has a lower capacity and could leave Spain with a shortfall. That means the country is in the market for more LNG supplies to be provided by ship. Meanwhile, the cost of electricity has soared by more than 40% over the last year, causing many Spaniards to look at having solar panels installed on their roofs as an alternative. The Spanish government has been forced to step in and cut several taxes to try to reduce bills. It had originally planned to keep lower rates in place until the end of 2021, but decided in December to extend the cut until May 2022. It has also introduced a temporary windfall tax on energy companies said to have profited from soaring prices, described by its minister for ecological transition as a ""shock plan"". It's aiming to collect about €2.6bn by the end of this financial year, when the six-month tax ends, redirecting those profits to consumers during months when energy usage is highest. "
geopolitical tensions,How people may get help to pay high energy bills,2024-09-15,2022-01-31,Faisal Islam,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60199024,"With rising energy costs set to push gas and electricity bills even higher, the government is looking at ways to soften the blow. But what route, if any, will it take? It's my understanding that Chancellor Rishi Sunak is considering a multi-billion pound intervention of a temporary and targeted nature, aimed at mitigating the coming record rises for the most vulnerable households.  It would be an ""energy price-based"" intervention, not a tax or benefit-based one. So that rules out the cut to VAT on energy bills called for by the Labour party.  A temporary intervention can be justified on the basis that most of the factors pushing up energy prices are freakish one-offs - from the mismatches in supply that followed the lifting of pandemic restrictions, to the geopolitical tensions with Russia.  The open question is just how targeted this intervention will be.  On its current trajectory, the energy price cap, which limits what providers can charge consumers, is likely to rise to close to £2,000 a year for dual fuel customers using a typical amount of energy. That will treble the number of households under ""fuel stress"", in other words spending more than a tenth of their income on energy, to 6.3 million. One way to help this group would be to widen the Warm Home Discount (WHD) scheme, which sees £140 automatically taken off the annual energy bills of anyone receiving pension credit. It is currently funded by increasing everyone else's bills.  There is talk of doubling the WHD and then extending it to working-age households receiving Universal Credit. If the taxpayer met that £2-3bn cost for a year, then the policy could have an impact, but it would require big changes to the WHD system. Another option for the government would be to look at green levies.  Everyone's energy bills contain about £200 of levies annually to support green energy and social support schemes. If the taxpayer stepped in for a year to fund these commitments, it could turn the heat down on those rising energy prices, but this policy is much harder to target. Yet another option would be some sort of smoothing mechanism to support energy companies with loans, known as a ""Cost Deferral Mechanism"".  It could operate with or without help from the Treasury or the Bank of England, but British Gas-owner Centrica is not a fan, having described it as a ""bailout"". It is unclear, however, why it does not think asking the taxpayer to shoulder renewable and social levy obligations is not also a bailout.  The Treasury is likely to announce any decision on support before the regulator Ofgem unveils the new price cap next Monday, so the chancellor and the Prime Minister will have to come to an agreement imminently."
