safe haven demand,Record year for school suspensions and exclusions,2024-09-15,2024-07-18,Nathan Standley,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2e4663g8nvo,"England has seen record numbers of school suspensions and exclusions in a single school year, Department for Education figures show. The 790,000 suspensions in 2022/23 - almost one for every 10 pupils - is 36% higher than the previous record, 578,000 in 2021/22.  The 9,000 exclusions - up 44% from 2021/22 - is also a sharp rise on the previous record, 7,900 in 2017/18. Persistent disruptive behaviour was the most common reason, accounting for 48% of all reasons given for suspension and 39% for exclusion. The 2022/23 summer term alone saw 275,000 suspensions and 3,200 exclusions - record figures for a single term. Suspended pupils must stay out of school for a fixed period, while those excluded are banned from their school permanently. Education Minister Stephen Morgan said the ""shocking"" figures were a ""wake-up call about the problems that have grown in our schools in recent years"". The education system was ""failing to meet the needs of children with additional needs"".  And the new government was ""determined to get to grips"" with the issue, through measures such mental-health specialists in schools, free breakfast clubs and earlier interventions for pupils with special educational needs. Staff at a school, in Boston, Lincs, went on strike earlier this year over claims about bad behaviour. And Aušra Marcinkevičiūtė, who withdrew her daughter from the school at the end of 2023 summer term, says the problems are worsening nationally because ""students do whatever they want"". ""Of course it's worrying, schools should be a safe place for our children,"" she says. Association of School and College Leaders general secretary Pepe Di'Iasio said the new data reflected the ""increasingly complex needs and challenging behaviour"" in schools and across wider society. ""Early intervention is key to solving this issue - but schools lack the resources to offer specialist support and local services have become overwhelmed by the increased demand,"" he said. Centre for Social Justice education lead Beth Prescott said there was a ""tidal wave of challenges hitting children, families and schools"". ""This has resulted in an increasing number of children struggling to fully engage with their education, with potentially catastrophic and lifelong consequences for their lives, for wider society and for the economy,"" she said. Children's charity Chance UK chief executive Vanessa Longley said its recent report suggested 90% of those excluded at primary school failed to pass GCSE English and maths. ""When you have children as young as five and six being excluded, then something is going very seriously wrong,"" she said. ""We need to support teachers and schools as well as children and families, so that children can be supported and get the extra help they need."" National Association of Head Teachers general secretary Paul Whiteman said the numbers ""should be a deep concern to everyone involved in education"". They were partly down to ""wider social issues"", such as child poverty, mental health and special education needs, which had ""increasingly gone unchecked over the last decade"", and were ""another stark reminder to the new government of the scale of the task ahead of them""."
safe haven demand,‘I grew up in care alone - then discovered I had siblings’,2024-09-15,2022-01-26,By Ashley John-Baptiste,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-60075421,"Ashley John-Baptiste grew up in care believing he was an only child. Then, out of the blue, he received a message from a brother he never knew he had. He set out to explore what being split from siblings means to those who have been in the care system.  As a toddler, I was placed in the care system. By 18, I had been moved between four foster families and a residential care home in south-east London.  It's really hard to describe what it was like growing up in so many different homes. It felt like being under a cloud of rejection - no sense of family, no sense of belonging. I did meet my birth mum when I was 10, but never met my dad. I always wondered why I wasn't adopted - was it ever a possibility?   Living in that residential home with other children gave me my first taste of brotherhood, but we had no control over our relationships in the long term. We would be moved, and disappear from each other's lives.  Children who are placed in care are given ""life story"" sessions by their local authority - this is where a social worker tells a child what they know about their family background and history. I was around seven when I had mine, and I was told I was an only child. So it was a huge shock when, in my mid-20s, a man messaged me on Facebook to tell me he was my older brother. I can still remember the visceral sense of confusion I felt when I first saw his message. I had to re-read it several times.   It took me a while to respond, but when we spoke we established that we had the same dad but different mothers, that there were more siblings out there and - most overwhelming for me - that we lived in the same area. All this time, my brother had been living close by. You can watch Ashley John-Baptiste's documentary Split Up In Care: Life Without Siblings on BBC iPlayer Despite the intense curiosity of these initial conversations, we never made plans to meet in person. As much as I welcomed the messages from my new-found brother, I never felt ready to meet face-to-face. Eventually, four years ago, we stopped messaging each other. But then, in the spring of 2020, as I was taking my new-born baby for a hospital check-up, I bumped into him by chance. I was leaving the hospital, he was making his way in to visit a sick relative. I recognised him instantly.    I called out to him sheepishly and to my relief, he recognised me.    We spoke for what seemed like ages. Despite it being our first meeting, there was a natural ease to our conversation. It felt like we had known each other all along.    I introduced him to my baby daughter. She met her uncle. We took a photo together in an unexpected ""family"" moment.    Even though we haven't met since, that moment profoundly changed my life.    Meeting my brother made me think how things could have been different if I had been given the chance to get to know my siblings when I was younger. I now know that I've got at least four, all older than me.    Every time I moved home as a looked-after child, I was forced to assimilate into a new family, to integrate in a different community and make new friends. My sense of childhood identity was fragmented between the homes I lived in. No single person knew me across all of my moves.    Meeting my brother made me imagine how things could have been if I'd had regular contact with my siblings during all the twists and turns of care. Imagine if I'd had someone like that to talk to, someone to see me grow up, it would have been a lifeline.    Even a few meetings a year while I was in care could have been a foundation for a relationship in adulthood.     I left care at 18 and lived alone in a council flat, before starting university. Living independently, where I was forced to make ends meet, brought a sense of abandonment and isolation that I wasn't prepared for.    While I had incredible friends who eased the emotional intensity of leaving care, knowing my siblings at that stage of life might have given me a sense of family and belonging. Maybe there would have been a chance to spend Christmas with family, or have somewhere to go back to between terms at university.  During our meeting outside the hospital, my brother just seemed to understand everything I was saying. He had an implicit understanding of my journey and outlook. There was a connection. I am baffled that none of my social workers seemed to know about the existence of my siblings. When I spoke to my old social worker, Rosalyn Payne, who looked after me between the ages of 15-18, she was surprised to hear I had a brother. So why wasn't there any information about my family in my files?  Files and information gathering have come a long way, Rosalyn told me. ""Back in the day we had paper files, now we have electronic files."" But that wasn't the only issue, she says. ""Families don't always tell us what we want to know at the time, and that happens quite a lot, where family members withhold information.""   Then I asked her a question I had never dared ask before - was I ever considered for adoption?  She told me that I was indeed put up for adoption when I was very young, but the couple who had been planning to adopt me got pregnant and withdrew from the process.  It was shattering news - realising in that moment that my life could have been completely different. However tough such questions are, I think they're important. Everybody wants to know who they are, and who they're connected to.  For the documentary we wanted to get a national perspective on the state of sibling relationships in the care system, but there is a lack of data.  The BBC sent more than 200 Freedom of Information requests to UK councils - out of all the authorities approached, nearly three-quarters responded. Based on these responses, nearly half of sibling groups in care are split up (45%) with more than 12,000 children separated from at least one of their siblings. And it can have a life-long impact.  I met Saskia, 24, from Manchester who was taken into care with her two brothers after being rescued from their birth family. They were adopted, but their new home was no safe haven.   Saskia and her brothers suffered physical abuse and neglect for a decade in the adoptive home. When the adoption broke down, they went back into council care, where they were soon split up across different placements, in different areas. Saskia was 11 at the time and contact with her brothers broke down altogether a few years later. She told me that being away from them made her feel like she was ""not strong any more"".  ""I lost such a key part of myself,"" she says. ""It was us three against the world, it always has been. Sometimes siblings are all you have left. If you take those away, you're taking away the last bit of someone's identity."" Saskia has now trained as a social worker, which has given her a new perspective. In hindsight, she feels they should have been allowed to stay together.  Her younger brother Toby really struggled and even spent time in prison. Although he has a job now, he told me his childhood experiences have made him into quite a resentful person. ""Even if life's going good, I'll still find some way to be negative in it."" Since they left care, they have been able to rebuild their relationships. ""My brothers are still in my life. I'm lucky. I see myself as very blessed,"" Saskia says.  According to the law across all parts of the UK, siblings should be kept together when it is possible and safe to do so. But with a rise in the number of children in care there simply aren't enough foster carers - especially now children need a room of their own. All of this means councils are struggling.  I spoke to the director of children's social care at Derby City Council, Suanne Lim, who told me that she doesn't have enough resources to fully support the children in her authority's care - even though the government did provide extra funding for vulnerable families during the pandemic.  ""We are very, very stretched. There have been year-on-year cuts to services that we are delivering and yet demand is rising,"" she said. ""Local authorities are close to the bone."" During the pandemic, Derby City council pioneered a rapid response team to support vulnerable families and prevent even more children from entering the system. Over the past 15 months the team say they have helped 60 families to stay together - and prevented 50 sibling groups from being split up. It's clear that social workers are under huge pressure. But at the same time, so many looked-after children are separated from their brothers and sisters and don't have the information about their families that they deserve.  In Scotland, the law has recently been changed to give siblings more control over their relationships. The Star Initiative in Fife hosts reunions for split-up sibling groups in care who get the chance to meet on the farm every few months, to hang out and rebuild their bonds. ""They've been through enough. Let's be a lifeline,"" says Karen Morrison, the foster carer who runs the charity. ""We're not only making a difference now, fast forward to when they leave the care system."" The Children's Commissioner for England, Dame Rachel de Souza, told the BBC that she would support a new law to keep siblings together. She has today published a new report based on the views of 6,000 children in care.  An independent review of the England care system is currently underway, with findings and recommendations expected to be published later this year.  For me, I have been able to answer more of the questions I had about who I am and where I come from. Even though I didn't grow up with my siblings, I now have the chance to get to know them. But perhaps most significantly, I can tell my daughter she has an uncle.

safe haven demand,Draft framework for Afghan peace 'agreed',2024-09-15,2019-01-28,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-47028177,"US and Taliban negotiators have agreed on a draft framework for a peace deal seeking to put an end to the 17-year conflict in Afghanistan, Washington's top negotiator has said. US negotiators held six days of talks with the Taliban in Qatar last week.  The Afghan president has made a new call for direct talks with the Islamist group, but they have so far refused, dismissing the government as ""puppets"". The group ruled the country from 1996-2001 and remain a top insurgent force. Their rule ended when the US invaded Afghanistan after al-Qaeda - which had used the country as a base - carried out the 9/11 attacks in the US. Analysts say it could be years before a substantive peace deal is reached. Zalmay Khalilzad, the US Special Representative for Afghanistan Reconciliation, was in Kabul to brief the Afghan government about the talks.  ""We have a draft of the framework that has to be fleshed out before it becomes an agreement,"" he told The New York Times in an interview, adding that as part of the proposed deal the Taliban would vow to prevent Afghanistan being used as a hub for terrorism. The Trump administration's strategy has been to put pressure on the Taliban to negotiate with the Afghan government. It is exploring a full withdrawal of US troops - in return for a ceasefire and a commitment by the Taliban to these direct talks. The Taliban say they will only begin negotiations with the government once a firm date for troop withdrawal has been agreed. The 17-year conflict has caused huge loss of life. According to UN figures, between 6,000 and 11,000 civilians have been killed every year since 2009. In the New York Times interview, Mr Khalilzad said the Taliban had pledged not to give terrorist groups like al-Qaeda safe haven - a key demand from Washington if it pulls out troops. ""The Taliban have committed, to our satisfaction, to do what is necessary that would prevent Afghanistan from ever becoming a platform for international terrorist groups or individuals,"" he said. Until the interview, the US envoy had only released a series of tweets about the talks - saying ""significant progress"" had been made but without providing details. The discussions clearly remain at a provisional stage - and a long way from agreement on the broader issues required for lasting peace in Afghanistan - but after years of stalemate, it's welcome progress, says the BBC's South Asia editor Jill McGivering. A senior Taliban official who attended the talks told the BBC over the weekend that both sides had agreed to form two committees to draw up detailed plans on how to implement agreements in principle on two key issues:  The Taliban official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the committees would ""identify routes for the withdrawal, and how much time is needed. We suggested six months, but are flexible"". By Jonathan Marcus, BBC Defence and Diplomatic correspondent It is often said that there is no military solution for the US and its allies in Afghanistan. The US approach is largely to convince the Taliban that they cannot win either.  But is this strategy succeeding? At one level the progress in the current talks would suggest it is. But the reality is that the Taliban are speaking from a position of relative strength.  Losses amongst the Afghan security forces are dramatic. The government only controls or influences territory containing some two-thirds of the population.  Nobody imagines that the Afghan military can be self-supporting any time soon.  Accurate metrics of the true security situation are hard to find. A huge amount of spin comes from US military sources. Now President Trump is signalling that he wants some, and eventually all, US troops out. But the strategy underpinning US withdrawal remains both uncertain and unclear. On Monday, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani issued a fresh plea to the Taliban to talk directly to his government.  He alluded to fears that freedoms could be lost if the Taliban were to share power. Women's rights activists have expressed particular concern due to the militants' brutal treatment of women when they ran the country. ""We are committed to ensuring peace,"" he said. ""But there are values which are non-negotiable, for example national unity, national sovereignty, territorial integrity, a powerful and competent central government and basic rights of the citizens of the country."" According to Mr Ghani's office, in a meeting on Sunday, Mr Khalilzad denied that there had been any discussions with the Taliban about future governance arrangements in Kabul. The Taliban's power and reach have surged since foreign combat troops left Afghanistan in 2014. Thousands of Nato-led troops remain in training, support and counter-terrorism roles.  The US has the largest contingent, with 14,000. US President Donald Trump is reportedly considering withdrawing half of these. About 8,000 from another 38 countries are also present. On Friday, Mr Ghani said more than 45,000 members of the country's security forces had been killed since he became leader in 2014. It is estimated that about 15 million people - half the Afghan population - are living in areas either controlled by the Taliban or where the militants are openly present and regularly mount attacks."
safe haven demand,Tree-planting driving up rural land prices,2024-09-15,2022-04-12,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-61068730,"Land values in Scotland are booming because investors are putting cash into forestry and tree-planting to offset carbon emissions, a new report says. The Scottish Land Commission said exceptionally high demand and low supply meant prices had risen sharply. The report said there was more demand for smaller farms because of the lifestyle attractions. And more corporate money - often from overseas - was looking for environmental investments. The Scottish Land Commission (SLC) is a Scottish government agency which looks at the concentration of land ownership and its effective use. Hamish Trench, from the SLC, said the report showed that demand for rural land from different types of buyer had increased significantly and was raising prices. The report found a growing number of non-farming investors who were influenced by long-term investment potential as well as ESG (environmental, social and governance) considerations, which promote a more sustainable corporate approach.  It said farmland values had risen by 31.2% in Scotland in 2021 compared with 6.2% across UK. The Scottish government has a target of 18,000 hectares (44,500 acres) of new woodland each year by 2024/25 in an attempt to offset the effects of climate change. Land reform campaigners have warned of businesses buying up land in Scotland to offset their carbon emissions rather than reducing what they emit. Green laird is a term that has been used to describe a business buying thousands of acres of land to plant with trees to help it achieve net zero - a balance between the carbon emitted into the atmosphere, and the carbon removed from it. Scottish Land & Estates, which represents rural land-based businesses, said it was unsurprising that potential buyers were responding to clear government signals to plant more trees. Land ownership is politically sensitive, in Scotland and in many countries around the world. That's partly because we all use it, but also because it has cultural, environmental and economic heft. Yet for all the hopes of radical land reform when the Scottish Parliament started work in 1999, there remains little to discourage secretive corporate and foreign money from buying up large chunks of Scotland and doing, quite often, not much with it of any use to the wider community. The legislated land reform we've seen is aimed at support for communities to get at least the opportunity to buy land when it comes on the market. But today's report points to a sharp increase in off-market deals, which give those communities no chance of putting their case and their finance together. There are several reasons for doing deals without transparency, in addition to subversion of that legal intent; it works for brokers to shift assets on their books to known investors on their books: some farmers don't want their neighbours to know they are ""selling out"" for forestry, which carries social disapproval in some farming circles. The buyers of estates used to want prestige and private lodges with bounteous space for hunting, shooting and fishing. Such owners tend to hang on to their land for a long time, and across generations.  Demand for property far outstrips supply, which is the simple explanation for prices soaring. However, this report suggests that there is ""declining social acceptability of driven grouse shooting"". Investors in the 2020s, typically younger, are more focused on land as a means of getting to net zero - as investment for forestry planting or existing woodland, either of these mean owners can offset their carbon emitting activities elsewhere. That's why a company such as Brewdog and its ""punk"" equity investors own a Highland estate, and new investment vehicles are joining it.  With land, the company or investor can get a certified store of carbon roughly equal, it is claimed, to the emissions from burning natural gas in the process of brewing beer in Ellon. This follows the policy of Westminster and Holyrood governments to boost tree planting on a massive scale. And it helps that the poor quality of land across much of Scotland is of much higher value for forestry than for grouse moor and sheep grazing. As the prices for upland farms rise relative to more productive agricultural land further down the strath, upland hill farmers can sell up to rich investors, and buy a smaller holding with which to change the way they farm. Part of the demand for Scottish farms is also coming from English farmers selling up at higher values and with tax advantages from doing so. This could have profound implications for rural Scotland. A rapid shift in the market that could bring major changes in the way Scotland looks, and in the type of jobs to be found in rural Scotland. One of the challenges is for communities, and the agencies that represent them, to engage with new owners to ensure there is a social dimension to their investing, which engages local people. The other challenge is to those who set policy on land ownership, notably at Holyrood: how much are they letting this shift in the market determine the future of Scottish land, ownership and farming? And what more do they need to do to have the policies, financial incentives and laws in place to achieve a broad mix of ownership and the best possible environmental and social outcomes for the nation? The report recognises that there is an element of speculation in the land market as investors look for a safe haven in a turbulent global economy and gamble on future carbon values rising.  Strong growth in land values is expected to continue due to continued low supply and high demand driven by the long-term policy on climate change and increasing pressure on the global timber market. In the Scottish estates market there was an estimated 87% increase on prices paid in 2020, and last year two estates sold for more than £20m, while five sold for between £10-£20 million.  About one third of buyers were from overseas. Mr Trench said: ""The way the land market functions is important to Scotland's ambitions such as net zero, nature restoration, repopulation, and community empowerment.   ""Being able to participate in the market shapes not just who owns Scotland's land, but who is able to make decisions and who benefits from land and its economic, social and environmental value."" Sarah-Jane Laing, chief executive of Scottish Land & Estates, which represents rural land-based businesses, said: ""It is unsurprising that potential buyers are responding to clear government signals to plant more trees and sequester more carbon as part of a global effort to tackle climate change.  ""Long-term investment in forestry is attractive to landowners and farmers as there is less volatility compared with some markets for farming produce.  ""However, as stated in the report, carbon is only the motivation for some buyers and it is clear that from this small sample of land sales that about half of buyers are acquiring estates and land for other reasons."""
safe haven demand,Kwarteng splurge meets unintended consequences,2024-09-15,2022-09-28,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-63066500,"Liz Truss wowed the Tory membership over the summer with a promise to cut tax and take on the ""abacus economics"" of the Treasury.  The abacus, as they've known since ancient times, is a useful tool for calculating numbers. But to the new prime minister, the idea that things should have to add up is one for the economic policy museum. So out went the orthodoxy, joined in the Whitehall skip by the top mandarin at the Treasury, Sir Tom Scholar. And in came Kwasi Kwarteng, a chancellor with a mini-budget that's had a maxi impact cutting tax, with a special emphasis on helping the highest earners and the most profitable companies. What was missing was the other side of the ledger. If there are not to be spending cuts on the same spectacular scale - and we're told last year's spending review will not be revisited - there will have to be borrowing. Lots of it. How much? We don't know, because the Office for Budget Responsibility was told not to publish any estimates based on the new tax, spend and borrowing decisions - at least for now. What we did get was the Treasury's estimate of how much borrowing might be required if it is successful in using tax cuts to boost growth. There's a catch there. Only Kwasi Kwarteng and his political fan club believe those growth rates are going to be achieved. Liz Truss probably thinks so too, because she put her name to an article about it for the Mail on Sunday. But since then, she's been oddly low key, to the point of being invisible.  Others tend to think the unintended consequences of the mini-budget will counteract any advantage to growth from taxpayers getting some money back next year, with which to boost spending. Those unintended consequences stem from a brief departure from the low-tax, high growth message in the prime minister's article: ""Our pursuit of growth will be reinforced by a responsible approach to the public finances,"" she said. ""We will set out our approach more fully in due course, including how we plan to get our national debt down over the medium term."" That ""due course"" has not run as expected. On Friday, financial markets were already giving the prime minister the thumbs down. Re-opening on Asia on Monday morning, they took the pound down to record lows against the US dollar. Sterling recovered a tad, but it remains weak and precariously close to the psychological tripwire of parity with the dollar. The US dollar has been strengthening against other currencies, as the safe haven when the economic storm clouds are gathering. And they are gathering.   The OECD developed nations economic club issued a very downbeat assessment of the world economy on Monday, blaming most of it on Russia, and flagging up further concerns about the Chinese property bubble. Among other things, the report said: ""Fiscal support can help cushion the impact of high energy costs on households and companies, but should be concentrated on aiding the most vulnerable and preserve incentives to reduce energy consumption."" ""Fiscal actions to cushion living standards must avoid persistent stimulus at a time of high inflation. Means-tested transfers to households broadly meet this criteria."" All those conditions are the precise opposite of what the new Liz Truss administration had chosen to do. Its measures to mitigate energy price rises - indiscriminately fired at all businesses and households at much higher cost than similar countries - not only mask the incentive to cut energy demand. They also add fuel to the inflationary fire following the tax-cutting mini-budget. All at just the wrong moment for the global economy. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) offered its commentary along similar lines, on Tuesday evening, UK-time. Not usually given to such strong criticism, at least of developed economies, its choice to become involved implied that Britain could be a problem for precarious financial markets more widely, and could carry the risk of contagion. The IMF used to be seen as the global force for neo-liberal privatisation and de-regulation, yet it told Britain that the inequality in its choice of fiscal measures is not just a social problem but an economic one. Moody's, one of the big three credit ratings agencies, joined in the criticism with similar stinging comment, as have financial commentators in Britain and around the world. There is incredulity about the mini-budget's lack of any discernible fiscal discipline to reassure investors that there is a limit to this borrowing splurge. The very people you might expect to cheer a tax cut to boost growth - which includes removing the cap on financial sector bonuses - are among the most scathing. The choreography of statements from the Bank of England and from the UK government, with further comment from central bank officials, suggest Treasury ministers have been put in an arm-lock. They emphasised that their dash for growth must be sustainable (in an economic sense at least), and that markets can be reassured that they will get an independent assessment of what this means for growth, inflation and borrowing from the Office for Budget Responsibility. That pledge was secured from the Treasury on Monday, promising that fiscal plans will be set out on 23 November - nearly two months away. Markets usually aren't that patient. Wednesday brought a private warning from the insurance industry that it faces solvency difficulties from having insured others against rising interest rates. That's why the Bank of England plunged into the market, to buy long-dated UK government bonds, thus helping to push down interest rates. It might help to explain, so here goes. The UK borrows by selling bonds to institutional investors, including banks, who pay with the money we then use for public services and so on. These bonds ('gilts' because the Bank of England used to issue them with a gold edging) are a promise to deliver a coupon, or an interest payment each year, and they run for a set number of years, which differs from one bond issue to the next. There are more than two trillion pounds-worth of such promises out there, and once issued, they are traded. If they are attractive to enough investors, as with any commodity, more demand means the price goes up. When that happens, the yield, or interest payment, becomes less valuable relative to the price being paid. That means interest rates automatically fall. And vice versa. If investors don't like the look of UK government bonds, they sell them. If enough traders do so, that lowers the price, and the interest rate on that bond automatically goes up. That's what we've seen happening. UK government bonds have been dumped, so the price goes down and interest rates up. It meant that pension funds, holding a lot of these bonds, were seeing the value of their portfolios fall rapidly, pushing them into serious difficulties.  With that growing systemic risk, the Bank of England has stepped in to buy a lot of UK government bonds to raise the price and lower the interest rate on them. It's doing so at an urgent pace, through to 14 October, and will be carried out ""on whatever scale is necessary"".  And if you're finding this a bit confusing, you're not alone. The central bank's announcement sent the value of the pound sharply up, very briefly, before going sharply down. Getting stuck into bond-buying has already taken the interest rate on a 30-year government bond from 5% interest to around 4%. And that feeds through the wholesale market to the mortgage lenders, who are seeking to price the cost of money before they commit to lending. Many of them have temporarily withdrawn from the market, to await developments, but with the certainty that when they will return, their interest rates will be higher.  And while these may look similar to the rates being paid before the 2008 financial crash - since when, interest rates have been exceptionally low - the gearing of loans has changed a lot. Property prices have risen faster than incomes, the ratio of loan-to-income is also up, so servicing a bigger mortgage than in past decades at even 4 or 5% feels like a much heavier burden than it used to do.  Will it affect the housing market? Certainly. But we don't yet know how. It's a reasonable bet that recent rapid inflation in the price of a home will at least slow up. Some lenders are war-gaming a significant fall in prices. That's the story so far. There's lots of it still to go. The price to Britain's economic credibility won't become clear for some time. And there's the fall-out politically for a prime minister and chancellor whose term in office looks to have started very, very badly."
safe haven demand,Would you accept a loss to keep your money safe?,2024-09-15,2019-08-19,By Dan Ascher,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-49398538,"Some of the world's biggest investors are so worried about the future of the global economy that they have taken the extraordinary step of paying for governments to look after their cash. They are nervous about a no-deal Brexit and the ongoing trade war between the US and China, as well as signs of a slump in demand in Germany, Europe's economic powerhouse. In times of crisis, investors usually flock to so-called safe-haven assets like gold, government bonds or good old fashioned cash. But for big investors, like pension funds, cash isn't practical and gold is considered risky. That has driven them toward government bonds and, unusually, investors are paying to hold them. In order to raise cash - to pay for everything from big infrastructure projects to covering the cost of their own debt - governments borrow money. One of the ways they do that is to issue fixed-term bonds, under which companies and individuals lend a set amount of money to the government, which promises to pay interest every year until it returns the total amount borrowed on a pre-agreed date in the future. Or, at least, that how it's supposed to work. Countries that are considered to be good borrowers, like Germany, will pay less interest than risky debtors, like Argentina, which is considered more likely to renege on its IOU (I owe you). Some big investors, such as pension funds, are limited to how much money they can put into riskier assets, which - twinned with a negative interest rate in Europe - has made bonds issued by the likes of Germany, France, Switzerland and Japan a very attractive purchase. For example, the overwhelming demand has sent the interest paid on 10-year German bonds crashing to minus 0.65%, meaning investors will make a loss if they lend money to Berlin. In effect, investors are paying governments to borrow their money - and that does not bode well for those hoping for economic growth. It means that people who make a living from predicting what economies will do in the future, are betting on interest rates remaining negative for at least ten years. And, worse, the 0.14% yield on 30-year German bonds suggests that investors are expecting interest rates to stay in the red for the next three decades. Tristan Hanson, who invests in bonds for M&G, says the current German bond price shows a ""high degree of risk aversion"" in Europe, where investors would rather accept a loss on holding their money than buy an apartment or invest it in stock markets. ""They are saying: 'I'd rather have a guaranteed small loss than risk a big loss in some other asset class',"" Mr Hanson explained For big institutional investors, cash is costly because they can't just put it under the mattress, according to Hargreaves Lansdown analyst, Laith Khalaf. ""I could build a massive secure basement and keep all my cash in that,"" he said. ""But actually that's quite expensive and if interest rates return to normal, I'm going to have an empty basement."" Big investors don't tend to keep their assets in a bank in case that bank fails, he added. ""If institutional investors are putting £30m in a bank, it means they have a lot of risk if that goes under,"" Mr Khalaf said. Big investors also like to hedge liabilities by buying bonds, he said. A pension fund that knows its pensions in 20 years will cost a certain amount will buy bonds that it expects will let it meet those obligations. He said the negative bond yields reflected broader economic woes. Will Hobbs from Barclays' investment arm believes investors' worries are overblown, saying the economy ""doesn't look that bad"". He said the fortunes of the global economy were tied to the US, which ""looks healthy"". ""All economies are perfectly capable of starting a fight in an empty room. ""But the big recessions they tend to be driven by the US economy and what happens there,"" he said. He said the negative bond yields had driven some investors to buy up gold, pushing prices to a six-year high. But the investment boss warned people to be careful of buying the precious metal. He said it's ""very difficult to value"", adding, ""there's a huge amount of emotion invested in the price""."
safe haven demand,The Channel beaches that host a lethal trade in human hope,2024-09-15,2021-11-27,By Lucy Williamson & William McLennan,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-59419963,"The brutal journeys migrants make across the Channel are book-ended with beaches that tell the story of the crisis: from guerrilla-style smuggling operations among the French dunes to streams of soaking passengers washing ashore in Kent. Hidden in the scrubby sand of the dunes of northern France are the calling cards of an international criminal industry: a discarded life-jacket, a rucksack, a petrol canister.  It is an industry that is sophisticated enough to commission specially-made boats and transport them across EU borders, but crude enough to hide clients for hours in scrubland before packing them on board. On Wednesday, 27 people were confirmed dead after their inflatable boat capsized - by far the worst tragedy since these crossings began. But the very next morning, more vessels left France's northern shores for England, packed with people undeterred by the horror of what had happened the day before. New arrivals in the camps here are given tips on how to find their people-smuggler. One young man, who had recently made it from Afghanistan, was told to look for ""the Kurdish man"" hanging around during food distribution twice a week. No-one the BBC spoke to had any problems finding someone to take them across. The smuggling networks often use migrants themselves to manage logistics on the ground. These are one-time residents of the camps in northern France who've grown disillusioned with the challenge of getting out, and are simply looking to make some money, or who still hold out hope of leaving, and need to earn their place on a boat. They serve as look-outs, hidden at intervals along the coast, sometimes for days in advance of a crossing. They note down the movements of security forces and alert their smuggler colleagues when it's time for passengers to break out of hiding and run down the beach to the sea.   Those hiding would have been told earlier that day to leave their camp. They would then usually have met at a secret rendezvous point before making a long walk to the coast - during which, migrants say, there are strict rules on behaviour, talking and mobile phones - and finally enduring a long wait concealed in the dunes. These hiding places are scattered all along this coast - not just in the dunes, but also in patches of woodland and in the concrete bunkers left over from World War Two. They are littered with the belongings previous passengers have left behind. On Friday at Plage du Braek, a popular departure point between Calais and Dunkirk on a windswept and industrial section of the coastline, signs of life were everywhere. Sheets of tarpaulin. A pink trainer, half buried in the sand. And nestled among the dunes, an abandoned tent, surrounded by plastic juice bottles. One man, who has worked for the smugglers in the past - let us call him David - explained that each smuggler has his favourite hiding places. ""They wait until the last minute, then bring the passengers one by one towards the beach, and hide them behind rocks or trees."" Boats and passengers are kept separate until the very last moment, David says, not to protect the people, but to preserve the boat in case they're spotted by police, who could confiscate or destroy it. The crafts themselves are often brought in from Germany or Belgium, to help avoid scrutiny from French police. Many networks here are said to count EU residents among their members, who can easily drive equipment across the border into France. Police say the boats are often specially commissioned - long and basic inflatable craft, built to hold as many people as possible. Their simple structure makes them especially dangerous. Separating inflatable vessels into compartments would help limit any damage and loss of air if the shell was punctured. And smugglers often don't bother, either, to reinforce the bottom of the boat with solid boards, meaning that the boats crumple when deflated, as one French minister said, like ""a child's paddling pool"". Everyone knows the risks. Many in the camps are glued to an app on their phones that predicts the weather conditions in the Channel each day. Waves over a metre high spell real danger. But few are deterred, and those that are find themselves confronted with a dilemma. The networks want to be paid, and there are reports of them threatening customers if they change their minds. There are several networks, with links to different communities and camps. And they're often in fierce competition with each other. Turf wars have become so vicious in the past year, one local mayor told the BBC, that some smugglers have started carrying guns.  And David says there is a shadowy side to the pricing system.   ""Some will demand sex from women who want to cross."" And poorer migrants, who can only scrape together a fraction of the asking price, will be put on old, over-crowded boats at the end of the good weather season, when the risks of crossing rise.   The stakes have only grown as French security forces have increased their patrols. The government here now says it's stopping more than half of all crossing attempts. But patrols are carried out by different teams depending on the area and the timing: gendarmes and police; reservists and professional soldiers. Finger-pointing between them is a regular feature of policing here. The BBC has been on patrol with units who walk through the dunes talking, laughing and waving bright torches around, but also with those who are silent, disciplined and focused.  But they're facing larger groups of migrants than before - up to 80 or 90 at a time, one security chief told us - and they're frequently more aggressive too. The smugglers know that patrols cannot intervene in a crossing if it would put lives in danger.  ""Just get into the water,"" they tell their passengers, ""and you're basically in the UK."" Some patrols on land will wade into shallow water to pull boats back to shore, but once at sea, vessels that are not in danger are simply monitored by French coastguards as they drift towards British waters. The French authorities offer rescue to anyone in distress, but the UK Border Force union has told the BBC that migrants are often reluctant to accept assistance while in French waters, for fear of being taken back to French soil.  Once over the mid-Channel dividing line, migrants are typically happy to be rescued. The coastguard in Dover takes control, typically despatching Border Force vessels and RNLI lifeboats. Migrants are helped to clamber on to deck, huddling beneath blankets and beanie hats for the final leg of their journey to England.  On busier days, however, British fishermen are often inadvertently the first on the scene.  ""It's a daily occurrence,"" says Jerry Oiller, who has run a charter fishing boat from the Kent coast for more than three decades. Earlier this year, he found two men in an inflatable canoe about four miles from the shore. ""The boat turned over and we had a job to get them back up, but we managed to pull them out,"" he said. ""It was like a kiddie's inflatable,"" he said. ""They didn't have anything with them, only two little pink paddles.""  The men, from French Guiana, told Mr Oiller they had been at sea for more than 24 hours.  After tethering the canoe alongside his boat Fairchance, he called the coastguard and made cups of sweet, black coffee for the pair, while waiting for a Border Force vessel to turn up. The majority of the 37,000 or so migrants that have made it to UK waters since 2018 have been intercepted at sea and dropped off directly at a secure area at the Port of Dover - known as the Tug Haven. Largely obscured from public sight, this collection of marquees and temporary buildings was only ever supposed to house people for a few hours, but inspectors have found migrants are increasingly forced to stay there overnight. It is here that most make their asylum application, before being dispersed around the country awaiting a full assessment and decision.  Some dinghies, however, run aground on British beaches unaided. About 1,600 boats have reached UK waters in the past two years, with dozens landing along a stretch of coastline from Joss Bay near Margate in the east, to Hastings in the west.  The majority make landfall at Dungeness - the most southerly tip of Kent. This nose-shaped headland that juts out into the Channel has been built up by the sea over thousands of years and will be the closest point on the horizon for any boat blown west of Dover. Mr Oiller's family have fished at Dungeness for generations. From the door of his cluttered hut, which is plastered with washed-up treasures combed from the beach, he can see the impact on local lifeboat crews. ""They were out seven times one day last week,"" he said. The shifting pattern of arrivals is also making the task more difficult and dangerous, he said. Where dinghies would once arrive by mid-morning, now they are turning up throughout the day, as boats push off from France later and later.  The size of the boats have also increased, often reaching lengths of up to 30ft (9 metres) or more, he said.  BBC analysis of Home Office data has found that the average number of people on each boat has risen sharply. In 2020, each vessel carried an average of 13 people. That figure more than doubled to 28 this year. Put another way, while the count of boats reaching British waters has risen by 47%, the number of people making it to the UK has risen by more than 200%. Mr Oiller believes the risks are rising too. ""If you stack a lot of people on, if there is an accident, it is more likely to be a big accident,"" he said.  Those that make it to Dungeness are greeted by a steep stone bank sloping to the foreshore. The water on a calm day can look like a mirrored mill pond. But the weather can deteriorate dramatically here.  ""It is a land of extremes,"" says local artist Helen Gillilan. ""We are sticking out at sea, if we get the wind, we get tremendous wind. Nature is so powerful here. You really feel these things."" The spartan landscape of shingle and scrub is home to two nuclear power stations, but also hosts a vast, insect-rich nature reserve. ""They must wonder where on earth they are when they land here,"" she said. ""It's like nowhere else in this country, it's not very British."" From her studio window, Ms Gillilan can see the ""now familiar line of people trudging up the long shingled walk to the lifeboat station"". Despite the frequency, she has not been desensitised. ""It really strikes me that they arrive with nothing,"" she said. ""It's just awful."" Residents have grown accustomed to the sight of dozens of wet and windswept people - often including young children - waiting outside by the lifeboat station for a hastily-arranged coach to take them to a Home Office facility in Dover or elsewhere in Kent. On a sunny day earlier this year, one resident told the BBC, she had been greeted by an arresting sight: on one side of the road, a group of migrants, waiting with Border Force for their transport, on the other, a coachload of children on a school field trip.  The stark scenery has attracted many artists, among them the late film director Derek Jarman, who, like the nuclear reactors, has become almost synonymous with Dungeness. Decades after his death, busloads of devotees still travel to his former home at Prospect Cottage. This year, however, many of the coaches leaving Dungeness carry a different sort of visitor, who, in a desperate search for a better life, have risked their lives overcoming Europe's borders.

safe haven demand,Coronavirus fears wipe £200bn off UK firms' value,2024-09-15,2020-02-28,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51681620,"London's FTSE 100 share index has seen one of its worst weeks since the depths of the financial crisis in 2008 as markets continue to reel from the impact of the coronavirus.  Shares have shed almost 13% of their value, wiping £210bn from the value of companies on the index. Investors are worried after a surge in the number of companies warning about the impact of the outbreak on firms. US markets are also in the red, with markets around the globe in retreat. ""The panic mode is full on,"" said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank. ""The coronavirus outbreak has certainly hit businesses, and it might have a longer-than-expected negative impact on company earnings and global growth,"" she added. Globally, the dismal week on stock markets has so far wiped about $5 trillion from the value of listed companies around the world, according to Capital Economics' chief economist Neil Shearing. He said that affected the value of pension pots and could make it more difficult to borrow money if banks become more fearful of taking risks. Big shifts in the stock market are often in the news, whether they are booms in the US or falls due to the coronavirus or the financial crisis. As companies grow, they issue shares. The largest companies in the UK have shares which are bought and sold on the London Stock Exchange. There are good reasons why this performance affects your life and finances. Millions have pensions - either private or through work - who will see their savings (in what is known as a defined contribution pension) invested by pension schemes. The value of their savings pot is influenced by the performance of these investments. Pension savers mostly let experts choose where to invest this money to help it grow. Widespread falls in share prices are likely to be bad news for pension savers. Read more here. Investors are selling shares over fears that consumers will spend less if the virus continues to spread in the UK, Mr Shearing said. Instead, he said, investors are putting their money into government bonds, which are considered a safer investment. ""The markets are essentially betting on the fact that growth is going to slow the central bank is going to cut interest rates,"" he said. And it could be a safe bet. In an interview with Sky News, Bank of England governor Mark Carney warned that the coronavirus outbreak could lead to a downgrade of the UK's economic growth prospects. One of the firms selling some shares to buy government bonds is Bowmore Asset Management. ""We've gone from risk assets into more safe-haven assets,"" the wealth manager's client director Charles Incledon said. The company said that more than 130 listed firms in the UK had warned about the effects of the coronavirus on their business. Those firms range from travel companies to drinks makers, with both British Airways owner, IAG, and Diageo, which makes Guinness, warning that the demand had been affected by the outbreak. But Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said that the reaction of investors to the announcements by companies was becoming increasingly irrational. ""Yes, the outbreak is frightening. Yes, it's unquantifiable. But is it as bad as a traditional influenza season in the West? No."" He said it had killed fewer people in Europe than the French heatwave last year. ""I don't want to sound macabre or unconcerned about it, but it shows how stock market sentiment has shifted from being over-exuberant to having no fear at all to now having reassessed things in a more sober fashion."""
safe haven demand,Cyber gang issues ultimatum to mass hack victims,2024-09-15,2023-06-07,By Joe Tidy,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-65829726,"A prolific cyber crime gang thought to be based in Russia has issued an ultimatum to victims of a hack that has hit organisations around the world.  The Clop group posted a notice on the dark web warning firms affected by the MOVEit hack to email them before 14 June or stolen data will be published. More than 100,000 staff at the BBC, British Airways and Boots have been told payroll data may have been taken. Employers are being urged not to pay up if the hackers demand a ransom. Cyber security research previously suggested Clop could be responsible for the hack which was first announced last week. The criminals found a way to break into a piece of popular business software called MOVEit and were then able to use that access to get into the databases of potentially hundreds of other companies. Analysts at Microsoft said on Monday they believed Clop was to blame, based on the techniques used in the hack. It has now been confirmed in a long blog post written in broken English. The post, seen by the BBC, reads: ""This is announcement to educate companies who use Progress MOVEit product that chance is that we download a lot of your data as part of exceptional exploit."" The post goes on to urge victim organisations to send an email to the gang to begin a negotiation on the crew's darknet portal. This is an unusual tactic as normally ransom demands are emailed to victim organisations by the hackers, but here they are demanding that victims get in touch. This could be because Clop itself can't keep up with the scale of the hack which is still being processed around the world. ""My take is that they just have so much data that it is difficult for them to get on top of it all. They're betting that if you know then you will contact them,"" says SOS Intelligence CEO Amir Hadžipasić. MOVEit is supplied by Progress Software in the US for many businesses to securely move files around company systems. Payroll services provider Zellis, which is based in the UK, was one of its users. Zellis has confirmed that eight UK organisations have had data stolen as a result, including home addresses, national insurance numbers and, in some cases, bank details. Not all firms have had the same data exposed. Zellis customers which has been breached include: Nova Scotia Government and the University of Rochester is also warning staff that data may have been stolen through the MOVEit vulnerability. Advice from experts is for individuals not to panic, and for organisations to carry out security checks issued by authorities like the Cyber Security and Infrastructure Authority in the US. Clop claims on its leak site that it has deleted any data from government, city or police services. ""Do not worry, we erased your data you do not need to contact us. We have no interest to expose such information,"" it reads. However, researchers say the criminals are not to be trusted. ""Clop's claim to have deleted information relating to public sector organisations should be taken with a pinch of salt. If the information has monetary value or could be used for phishing, it's unlikely that they will simply have disposed it,"" said Brett Callow, threat researcher from Emsisoft. Cyber security experts have long tracked the exploits of Clop, which is thought to be based in Russia as it mainly operates on Russian speaking forums. Russia has long been accused of being a safe haven to ransomware gangs - which it denies. However, Clop runs as a ""ransomware as a service"" group, which means hackers can rent their tools to carry out attacks from anywhere. In 2021, alleged Clop hackers were arrested in Ukraine in a joint operation between Ukraine, US and South Korea. At the time, authorities claimed to have taken down the group which they said was responsible for extorting $500m from victims around the world. But Clop has continued to be a persistent threat."
safe haven demand,Kwarteng splurge meets unintended consequences,2024-09-15,2022-09-28,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-63066500,"Liz Truss wowed the Tory membership over the summer with a promise to cut tax and take on the ""abacus economics"" of the Treasury.  The abacus, as they've known since ancient times, is a useful tool for calculating numbers. But to the new prime minister, the idea that things should have to add up is one for the economic policy museum. So out went the orthodoxy, joined in the Whitehall skip by the top mandarin at the Treasury, Sir Tom Scholar. And in came Kwasi Kwarteng, a chancellor with a mini-budget that's had a maxi impact cutting tax, with a special emphasis on helping the highest earners and the most profitable companies. What was missing was the other side of the ledger. If there are not to be spending cuts on the same spectacular scale - and we're told last year's spending review will not be revisited - there will have to be borrowing. Lots of it. How much? We don't know, because the Office for Budget Responsibility was told not to publish any estimates based on the new tax, spend and borrowing decisions - at least for now. What we did get was the Treasury's estimate of how much borrowing might be required if it is successful in using tax cuts to boost growth. There's a catch there. Only Kwasi Kwarteng and his political fan club believe those growth rates are going to be achieved. Liz Truss probably thinks so too, because she put her name to an article about it for the Mail on Sunday. But since then, she's been oddly low key, to the point of being invisible.  Others tend to think the unintended consequences of the mini-budget will counteract any advantage to growth from taxpayers getting some money back next year, with which to boost spending. Those unintended consequences stem from a brief departure from the low-tax, high growth message in the prime minister's article: ""Our pursuit of growth will be reinforced by a responsible approach to the public finances,"" she said. ""We will set out our approach more fully in due course, including how we plan to get our national debt down over the medium term."" That ""due course"" has not run as expected. On Friday, financial markets were already giving the prime minister the thumbs down. Re-opening on Asia on Monday morning, they took the pound down to record lows against the US dollar. Sterling recovered a tad, but it remains weak and precariously close to the psychological tripwire of parity with the dollar. The US dollar has been strengthening against other currencies, as the safe haven when the economic storm clouds are gathering. And they are gathering.   The OECD developed nations economic club issued a very downbeat assessment of the world economy on Monday, blaming most of it on Russia, and flagging up further concerns about the Chinese property bubble. Among other things, the report said: ""Fiscal support can help cushion the impact of high energy costs on households and companies, but should be concentrated on aiding the most vulnerable and preserve incentives to reduce energy consumption."" ""Fiscal actions to cushion living standards must avoid persistent stimulus at a time of high inflation. Means-tested transfers to households broadly meet this criteria."" All those conditions are the precise opposite of what the new Liz Truss administration had chosen to do. Its measures to mitigate energy price rises - indiscriminately fired at all businesses and households at much higher cost than similar countries - not only mask the incentive to cut energy demand. They also add fuel to the inflationary fire following the tax-cutting mini-budget. All at just the wrong moment for the global economy. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) offered its commentary along similar lines, on Tuesday evening, UK-time. Not usually given to such strong criticism, at least of developed economies, its choice to become involved implied that Britain could be a problem for precarious financial markets more widely, and could carry the risk of contagion. The IMF used to be seen as the global force for neo-liberal privatisation and de-regulation, yet it told Britain that the inequality in its choice of fiscal measures is not just a social problem but an economic one. Moody's, one of the big three credit ratings agencies, joined in the criticism with similar stinging comment, as have financial commentators in Britain and around the world. There is incredulity about the mini-budget's lack of any discernible fiscal discipline to reassure investors that there is a limit to this borrowing splurge. The very people you might expect to cheer a tax cut to boost growth - which includes removing the cap on financial sector bonuses - are among the most scathing. The choreography of statements from the Bank of England and from the UK government, with further comment from central bank officials, suggest Treasury ministers have been put in an arm-lock. They emphasised that their dash for growth must be sustainable (in an economic sense at least), and that markets can be reassured that they will get an independent assessment of what this means for growth, inflation and borrowing from the Office for Budget Responsibility. That pledge was secured from the Treasury on Monday, promising that fiscal plans will be set out on 23 November - nearly two months away. Markets usually aren't that patient. Wednesday brought a private warning from the insurance industry that it faces solvency difficulties from having insured others against rising interest rates. That's why the Bank of England plunged into the market, to buy long-dated UK government bonds, thus helping to push down interest rates. It might help to explain, so here goes. The UK borrows by selling bonds to institutional investors, including banks, who pay with the money we then use for public services and so on. These bonds ('gilts' because the Bank of England used to issue them with a gold edging) are a promise to deliver a coupon, or an interest payment each year, and they run for a set number of years, which differs from one bond issue to the next. There are more than two trillion pounds-worth of such promises out there, and once issued, they are traded. If they are attractive to enough investors, as with any commodity, more demand means the price goes up. When that happens, the yield, or interest payment, becomes less valuable relative to the price being paid. That means interest rates automatically fall. And vice versa. If investors don't like the look of UK government bonds, they sell them. If enough traders do so, that lowers the price, and the interest rate on that bond automatically goes up. That's what we've seen happening. UK government bonds have been dumped, so the price goes down and interest rates up. It meant that pension funds, holding a lot of these bonds, were seeing the value of their portfolios fall rapidly, pushing them into serious difficulties.  With that growing systemic risk, the Bank of England has stepped in to buy a lot of UK government bonds to raise the price and lower the interest rate on them. It's doing so at an urgent pace, through to 14 October, and will be carried out ""on whatever scale is necessary"".  And if you're finding this a bit confusing, you're not alone. The central bank's announcement sent the value of the pound sharply up, very briefly, before going sharply down. Getting stuck into bond-buying has already taken the interest rate on a 30-year government bond from 5% interest to around 4%. And that feeds through the wholesale market to the mortgage lenders, who are seeking to price the cost of money before they commit to lending. Many of them have temporarily withdrawn from the market, to await developments, but with the certainty that when they will return, their interest rates will be higher.  And while these may look similar to the rates being paid before the 2008 financial crash - since when, interest rates have been exceptionally low - the gearing of loans has changed a lot. Property prices have risen faster than incomes, the ratio of loan-to-income is also up, so servicing a bigger mortgage than in past decades at even 4 or 5% feels like a much heavier burden than it used to do.  Will it affect the housing market? Certainly. But we don't yet know how. It's a reasonable bet that recent rapid inflation in the price of a home will at least slow up. Some lenders are war-gaming a significant fall in prices. That's the story so far. There's lots of it still to go. The price to Britain's economic credibility won't become clear for some time. And there's the fall-out politically for a prime minister and chancellor whose term in office looks to have started very, very badly."

safe haven demand,Draft framework for Afghan peace 'agreed',2024-09-15,2019-01-28,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-47028177,"US and Taliban negotiators have agreed on a draft framework for a peace deal seeking to put an end to the 17-year conflict in Afghanistan, Washington's top negotiator has said. US negotiators held six days of talks with the Taliban in Qatar last week.  The Afghan president has made a new call for direct talks with the Islamist group, but they have so far refused, dismissing the government as ""puppets"". The group ruled the country from 1996-2001 and remain a top insurgent force. Their rule ended when the US invaded Afghanistan after al-Qaeda - which had used the country as a base - carried out the 9/11 attacks in the US. Analysts say it could be years before a substantive peace deal is reached. Zalmay Khalilzad, the US Special Representative for Afghanistan Reconciliation, was in Kabul to brief the Afghan government about the talks.  ""We have a draft of the framework that has to be fleshed out before it becomes an agreement,"" he told The New York Times in an interview, adding that as part of the proposed deal the Taliban would vow to prevent Afghanistan being used as a hub for terrorism. The Trump administration's strategy has been to put pressure on the Taliban to negotiate with the Afghan government. It is exploring a full withdrawal of US troops - in return for a ceasefire and a commitment by the Taliban to these direct talks. The Taliban say they will only begin negotiations with the government once a firm date for troop withdrawal has been agreed. The 17-year conflict has caused huge loss of life. According to UN figures, between 6,000 and 11,000 civilians have been killed every year since 2009. In the New York Times interview, Mr Khalilzad said the Taliban had pledged not to give terrorist groups like al-Qaeda safe haven - a key demand from Washington if it pulls out troops. ""The Taliban have committed, to our satisfaction, to do what is necessary that would prevent Afghanistan from ever becoming a platform for international terrorist groups or individuals,"" he said. Until the interview, the US envoy had only released a series of tweets about the talks - saying ""significant progress"" had been made but without providing details. The discussions clearly remain at a provisional stage - and a long way from agreement on the broader issues required for lasting peace in Afghanistan - but after years of stalemate, it's welcome progress, says the BBC's South Asia editor Jill McGivering. A senior Taliban official who attended the talks told the BBC over the weekend that both sides had agreed to form two committees to draw up detailed plans on how to implement agreements in principle on two key issues:  The Taliban official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the committees would ""identify routes for the withdrawal, and how much time is needed. We suggested six months, but are flexible"". By Jonathan Marcus, BBC Defence and Diplomatic correspondent It is often said that there is no military solution for the US and its allies in Afghanistan. The US approach is largely to convince the Taliban that they cannot win either.  But is this strategy succeeding? At one level the progress in the current talks would suggest it is. But the reality is that the Taliban are speaking from a position of relative strength.  Losses amongst the Afghan security forces are dramatic. The government only controls or influences territory containing some two-thirds of the population.  Nobody imagines that the Afghan military can be self-supporting any time soon.  Accurate metrics of the true security situation are hard to find. A huge amount of spin comes from US military sources. Now President Trump is signalling that he wants some, and eventually all, US troops out. But the strategy underpinning US withdrawal remains both uncertain and unclear. On Monday, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani issued a fresh plea to the Taliban to talk directly to his government.  He alluded to fears that freedoms could be lost if the Taliban were to share power. Women's rights activists have expressed particular concern due to the militants' brutal treatment of women when they ran the country. ""We are committed to ensuring peace,"" he said. ""But there are values which are non-negotiable, for example national unity, national sovereignty, territorial integrity, a powerful and competent central government and basic rights of the citizens of the country."" According to Mr Ghani's office, in a meeting on Sunday, Mr Khalilzad denied that there had been any discussions with the Taliban about future governance arrangements in Kabul. The Taliban's power and reach have surged since foreign combat troops left Afghanistan in 2014. Thousands of Nato-led troops remain in training, support and counter-terrorism roles.  The US has the largest contingent, with 14,000. US President Donald Trump is reportedly considering withdrawing half of these. About 8,000 from another 38 countries are also present. On Friday, Mr Ghani said more than 45,000 members of the country's security forces had been killed since he became leader in 2014. It is estimated that about 15 million people - half the Afghan population - are living in areas either controlled by the Taliban or where the militants are openly present and regularly mount attacks."
safe haven demand,Staycation boom 'to stay' despite travel rule ease,2024-09-15,2022-02-07,By George Herd,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-60293159,"Holidaymakers still want a staycation this year - despite many pandemic restrictions easing, tourism leaders have said. One major holiday park destination in Wales said it was already fully booked ahead of its opening week in March. Tourism bosses across Snowdonia said demand was buoyant - with bookings expected to exceed last summer. But the sector said managing to recruit enough staff to meet holidaymakers' expectations was challenging. ""Already in our early bookings, our park is full,"" said Denise Bossons, the general manager overseeing operations at Hafan y Môr in Pwllheli. The park on Gwynedd's Llŷn peninsula is one of the largest in the Haven holiday group's portfolio, and for more than 40 years was known as Butlin's Pwllheli. At the height of the holiday season, the park now employs about 650 people - the vast majority local to the area. In November, a £15m redevelopment programme for the park was approved by planners, reflecting the company's confidence in the staycation market. The staycation confidence is echoed by the Snowdonia 360 partnership, which brings together and promotes about 30 visitor destinations around the national park and north Wales coast. It said there had already been a surge in advance bookings for this year - and also next year. ""The figures are looking very promising,"" said Sian Pritchard at Snowdonia 360. ""Some of our accommodation providers are fully booked for February half-term, some also fully booked over Easter, and we are also finding people want to come to the area now, which is out of season."" She said staycations in north Wales were ""here to stay"" for this year and next year, with many of the visitors making a return journey, after enjoying experiences on their doorstep during the pandemic. ""Those with families especially, and those who have invested in having their pets over lockdown, they are looking for dog-friendly, family friendly holidays, and I think north Wales is the perfect destination for that,"" she added.  But demand to holiday closer to home, alongside the pandemic, has brought other challenges - especially when it comes to recruiting hospitality staff. The Italianate village of Portmeirion near Porthmadog is expecting to cater for up to 3,000 visitors a day, alongside a thriving hotel business on the site made famous by the cult 1960s television show The Prisoner. Location manager Meurig Jones said they would had to be creative in how they deal with that demand, and would be holding job fairs at the attraction in the coming weeks. ""I think there are less people around, and the tourism industry isn't the easiest to work in,"" he said, adding: ""It's long hours, and it can be long nights."" Back at Hafan y Môr, the teams there need to recruit 350 new staff working across its entire operations, from catering and bar staff, to running site supermarkets and cleaning teams. In the kitchens of its main Coast House restaurant, it has come up with a new approach to tackling the shortage in chefs and cooks - and that is to train them from scratch. This year, about 25 new recruits, some without any catering experience, are being taught at Haven's inhouse chef academy. One of those putting them through their paces is chef Billy Butcher: ""We've got a lot variety of people among the new recruits, with a lot of different levels of where they are at - some of them don't even know how to cook an egg. ""Through this training process they are starting to learn skills they never thought they never thought they'd be able to learn,"" he added.  By the end of February, the trainees will begin a guaranteed 18 month placement, finding themselves working in live kitchens, and ready to serve up food for real holidaymakers at Hafan y Mor, and other Haven parks across the UK. But have firms such as Haven put all their eggs - and bacon in this case - in one basket, banking on another bumper staycation summer? Travel agent Gwen Elen Morgan does not think so. Based at independent travel firm Nico Travel in the Conwy Valley town of Llanrwst, she said while they are seeing the return of the international traveller, holidaying near to home remains popular. ""I think people are definitely enjoying staycations this year,"" she said. ""It's a win-win for us, because we can offer both - it's great for everybody."""
safe haven demand,The threat of al-Qaeda haunts Afghanistan pull-out,2024-09-15,2021-07-06,By Frank Gardner,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-57738731,"Western intelligence chiefs are worried. They have good reason to be.  The hurried departure this month of the remaining Western forces from Afghanistan, decreed by US President Joe Biden, has emboldened Taliban insurgents. In recent days they have seized one district after another, overrunning bases where demoralised government troops have often surrendered or fled. Now, say observers, the spectre of international terrorism is making an unwelcome return. ""The Biden withdrawal from Afghanistan makes a Taliban takeover inevitable and gives al-Qaeda the opportunity to rebuild its network, to the point where it could once again plot attacks around the world,"" Dr Sajjan Gohel, a security and terrorism analyst, told the BBC. That is certainly at the more pessimistic end of the spectrum but two things are certain here.  Firstly, the Taliban - the hardline Islamists who ruled Afghanistan from 1996-2001 with a rod of iron - are coming back in some form. For now, they say they have no ambition to take Kabul, the capital, by force. But in large parts of the country they are already the dominant force and they have never dropped their demand to make the country an Islamic Emirate according to their own strict guidelines. Secondly, al-Qaeda and its rival, the Islamic State in Khurasan Province (IS-KP), will be looking to profit from the departure of Western forces to expand their operations in Afghanistan. Al-Qaeda and IS are already in Afghanistan. The country is simply too mountainous, the terrain too rugged, for there not to be numerous remote hiding places for these internationally proscribed terror groups to hide away in. But up until now the Afghan government intelligence service, the NDS, working closely with US and other special forces, has been able to partly contain the threat.  Attacks and bombings have still taken place, but on countless occasions that we rarely hear about in public, tipoffs by human informants or an intercepted mobile phone call have resulted in swift and effective action by Afghan and Western special forces. Operating from bases inside Afghanistan, they have often been able to react within minutes, landing by helicopter, sometime in the dead of night, catching their enemy by surprise. That is now coming to an end. The Taliban have made it clear this week that they expect any Western forces left behind - even those guarding Kabul airport or the US embassy - to be a violation of the Doha deal that commits all US forces to departing by 11 September. They have vowed to attack any such remaining forces. Yet this week UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to chair a meeting of his government's secretive National Security Council (NSC) to discuss just what military assistance Britain should be leaving in place.  The former chief of the Secret Intelligence Service, Sir Alex Younger, told Sky News that ""the terror threat to Britain will grow if the West abandons Afghanistan"". But here's the dilemma: leave behind a few dozen SAS or other Special Forces operatives in the country, without the protective shield of US military bases and close air support, and they risk being hunted down by a resurgent Taliban. Pull them out, as the Taliban have demanded, and the West has no means to react quickly to intelligence on terrorist activity. So what exactly is the relationship between the Taliban and al-Qaeda?  Does a Taliban return to power in some form inevitably mean a return of al-Qaeda, with all its bases, its terror training camps and its hideous poison-gas experiments on dogs? In short, the very things the US-led invasion of 2001 was intended to close down forever. This question has been vexing Western intelligence chiefs for years. Twice now, in 2008 and again this year, classified British government assessments have been carelessly left lying around in public places, revealing to anyone who cared to read them how concerned the UK was about the link between the two groups. Dr Gohel, who has been studying extremist groups in the region for years, was in no doubt. ""The Taliban is inseparable from al-Qaeda, with cultural, familial and political obligations from which it will remain unable to fully abandon, even were its leadership sincere in seeking to do so,"" Dr Gohel of the Asia Pacific Foundation said. From the time that the al-Qaeda leader, Osama bin Laden, moved his operations from Sudan back to Afghanistan in 1996 up until 2001, the Taliban provided a safe haven for him.  Saudi Arabia, one of only three countries to recognise the Taliban government at the time, sent its intelligence chief, Prince Turki al-Faisal, to try to persuade the Taliban to hand over bin Laden. They refused and it was from al-Qaeda's Afghan base that the devastating 9/11 attacks were planned and directed. But the UK's Chief of Defence Staff, General Sir Nick Carter, who served several command tours in Afghanistan, believes the Taliban leadership may have learnt from their earlier mistakes.  He maintained that if the Taliban expect to share power, or seize it, then they will not want to be seen as international pariahs this time around. And here lies the difficulty. Wiser heads among the Taliban, especially those who have tasted the good life in the air-conditioned shopping malls of Doha during the recent peace negotiations, may well argue for a clean break with al-Qaeda in order to secure international acceptance.  But in a vast, thinly governed country like Afghanistan, it is by no means certain that even a future Taliban government could contain al-Qaeda, which could easily embed its cells unseen within villages and remote valleys. Ultimately what both al-Qaeda and the Islamic State group need to thrive is a chaotic, unstable situation. All the signs indicate that in Afghanistan, they are about to get it."
safe haven demand,Why is the US dollar falling?,2024-09-15,2017-08-11,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-40853840,"The US dollar, long a symbol of American economic might, has fallen steadily this year.  The value of the dollar index, which tracks the dollar against six major global currencies, has fallen about 10% since January.  It pushed lower on Friday, even as demand for other safe-haven assets - typically a category that includes the US dollar - rose amid sabre-rattling between the US and North Korea.  The dollar, which surged in 2014 as the US economy gained strength, is hardly in danger territory. The index is running just a bit lower than it was a year ago. But key US economic data was weaker last year. So what's behind this year's decline? In some ways, this is a good news story, driven by a better economy in Europe. The euro lost ground against the dollar in 2014, when central bankers adopted a stimulus program, while the US started to move away from stimulus policies. Now, as the Eurozone economy improves and the European Central Bank eyes an end to the stimulus, the currencies are starting to move closer together. The election of pro-EU Emmanuel Macron in France in June contributed to confidence in the Euro. The Euro's gain is the dollar's loss. A Euro is now worth more than $1.17, up more than 10 cents since the end of last year. But this isn't just a European story. The dollar has lost ground against many other currencies, including the Japanese Yen, the Mexican peso and the Swedish Krona. Even the British pound, which plunged after the Brexit vote, has regained some of its power against the dollar in recent months. (It's now valued at about $1.30, up from $1.22 in March.) ""This type of broad based decline shows you that it's really people moving away from the dollar, rather than just moving towards these other currencies,"" says Sameer Samana, a global quantitative and technical strategist at Wells Fargo based in St. Louis, Missouri. One reason? Donald Trump. Analysts trace the dollar's surge in the final months of 2016 to his win, which fuelled expectations of tax cuts or infrastructure investment - spending expected to drive demand for the dollar. Now they say the retreat shows traders recalculating, as Mr Trump's economic agenda stalls. An ongoing investigation into ties between Russia and the Trump campaign has cast a shadow over his administration. And alarm over Mr Trump's erratic statements and foreign policy clashes - including with North Korea this week - has also increased. ""If people feel like there's greater political uncertainty ... they kind of vote with their dollar,"" says Mr Samana says.  Rising interest rates are traditionally linked to stronger currencies, since higher rates attract investment. The US central bank has raised interest rates four times since December 2015, and conventional wisdom calls for another in December. But Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said recently that even supposing future hikes, interest rates are likely to remain historically low for some time. The steady ascent of Janet Yellen IMF cuts forecasts for US economic growth US markets are rising - so why are some people worried? Her caution in part reflects American economic growth that remains humdrum, with inflation and wage growth lagging.  ""What's going on now is an expectation that the Fed will continue to be relatively loose in its monetary policy, while the [European Central Bank] starts to tighten,"" says Jeffry Frieden, a professor of government at Harvard University and the author of ""Currency Politics"". ""That is roughly analogous to saying there are expectations that the US will not grow as rapidly as anticipated."" It's tough to know where the dollar is headed next, since at the moment it's neither strongly over- or under-valued, says Jeffrey Frankel, a professor of economics at the Harvard Kennedy School.  Richard Marston, a professor of finance at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton Business School, says he doesn't read too much into the decline, pointing to US stocks over the same period, which soared to new records. ""It's not a question of confidence in the US and the US government because that would also affect the equity markets,"" he says.  But Mr Frieden says he thinks there is a risk of a free-fall, given disarray in Washington and uncertainty about the Federal Reserve. Ms Yellen's term ends in February and it's not clear whom Mr Trump will name to replace her. ""If [the dollar] started really declining in a continual way that seems not to be just random or small fluctuations ... that would indicate a real loss of confidence in the US economy, a real loss of confidence in the US government,"" says Mr Frieden.  ""That would be a very bad thing and that would be something that the government had to respond to."" Mr Frankel says he used to predict the dollar would lose its status as an international currency, because of rising national debt and other factors. But that forecast was confounded when investors flocked to the dollar during the economic turmoil of 2008 - even though America was the source of many of the problems. ""I finally stopped making that prediction and I'm not ready to switch back,"" he says. ""I think the dollar is still - in some ways even more so - the number one international currency."" Mr Trump isn't worried either.  In a recent interview with the Wall Street Journal, Mr Trump said he liked a dollar that's ""not too strong"". ""Frankly, other than the fact that it sounds good, lots of bad things happen with a strong dollar,"" he said. As an official presidential position, it was a radical statement, since for US consumers - who buy a lot from overseas - a weaker dollar means reduced spending power. The same is true for US manufacturers who rely on parts produced abroad. ""The weaker the dollar is, the poorer Americans are on average,"" says Mr Frieden. ""That's not just rhetoric. That's the reality."" But Mr Trump's pro-business administration has focused on reinvigorating US manufacturing and exports, which become cheaper and therefore more competitive globally if the dollar weakens. US firms with global operations also get a boost to their bottom line, as the business overseas becomes more valuable. (That effect contributed to the stock market's rise this year.) Eventually, economic theory predicts a cycle, as more expensive foreign goods increase prices and inflation in the US, prompting the Fed to raise rates - which ultimately boosts the dollar.  ""As a tourist, of course I want the dollar to be as strong as possible,"" says Mr Marston. ""As someone who watches the American economy, it's good news."""
safe haven demand,Oil on stormy market waters,2024-09-15,2020-05-19,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-52718928,"Tuesday 19 May: pencilled in to my diary as a day to watch for oil market chaos. I'll have to focus on the new job figures instead, because the oil market is on the up. The warning of chaos came a month ago, when the US benchmark price went negative. Global supply was vastly outstripping demand. Storage tanks at Cushing, Oklahoma - the hub for storing the region's oil - were either filling up, or booked up. And in a quirk of America's oil market, the monthly closure of delivery contracts arrived with a lot of traders unable to store the black stuff. So they had to pay to offload it. With even more supply and even less storage by mid-May, things were set fair for more of the same mayhem. But things have changed. The price of West Texas Intermediate benchmark crude has risen from below $20, when the mayhem subsided a month ago, to nearly $33 per barrel, surging 12% for good measure on Monday. Brent crude, the North Sea cocktail that serves as a benchmark for the rest of the world, was also up by nearly 8%, trading around $35. The last time they were close to these levels was mid-March, on a rapid descent because Opec had failed to agree with Russia on cutting production, and both Europe and North America were heading towards lockdown. What things have changed? There's more demand than there was. China and its neighbours have fired up their economies to some extent. Europe and North America are beginning to do so. Monday's stock markets were also buoyed by a more positive vibe from eased lockdown and a supportive US Fed. Supply has been cut. The eventual agreement between the Opec oil exporter cartel and non-member Russia was not enough last month, but Saudis added a further tranche of production cuts. There's still an imbalance, and the price is still lower than producers want or need it to be. But it looks stabilised for now. One of the most significant parts of the supply cut was in the US. America doesn't have an autocrat's power to turn the taps. A historic quirk of the Texas oil industry is that it's regulated by the Texas Railroad Commission. It met early this month, and opted not to impose any restraints. That's because the price was restraining enough. Fracking is a boom and bust technology. In March, production was very strong. The USA had become the world's biggest oil producer. But by the middle of this month, it had lost two-thirds of the temporary drilling rigs used to frack for oil and gas, and counted weekly by industry data specialist Baker Hughes. That is going to hurt those who invested in the US boom, but it's good news for other producers who needed prices to rise.  Effectively, it means the US has become the swing producer. Instead of the Saudi-led Opec cartel controlling the taps and therefore the price, the price has become the mechanism for Texan and Dakotan drillers to match demand with supply. There is one other element worth noting about the decreased volatility from last month. Industry analysts explain much of the plunge into negative prices by reference to speculative flows of investment funds. There are moves afoot to limit the ability of investors to move US markets that way - though they were also afoot 12 years ago, when speculators drove the price up to a $145 spike. That matters because volatility directly affects investment decisions by oil companies, and that feeds through to jobs. A lot of jobs. President Trump is aware of that in an election year. He performed an impressive contortion last week, with a Tweet that welcomed both rising crude prices - meaning jobs, and low fuel costs, which has felt like a tax cut. It also matters because speculators can disrupt markets for other commodities that are important to the world economy. That could include food, which saw a period of global market volatility during the financial crisis in 2008, and left a lot of people hungry. One commodity that is always there at times of crisis, as a safe haven in an investment storm, is gold. It doesn't earn you anything, but it's rare and it doesn't corrode. It's been on the rise in recent weeks, now trading at its highest levels since 2012, above $1.750 per ounce."
safe haven demand,How selling citizenship is now big business,2024-09-15,2019-10-09,By Sarah Treanor and Vivienne Nunis,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-49958628,"You can be born into it, you can earn it, and you can lose it. Increasingly, you can also invest your way into it. The ""it"" is citizenship of a particular country, and it is a more fluid concept than ever before. Go back 50 years, and it was uncommon for countries to allow dual citizenship, but it is now almost universal. More than half of the world's nations now have citizenship-through-investment programmes. According to one expert, Swiss lawyer Christian Kalin, it is now a global industry worth $25bn (£20bn) a year. Mr Kalin, who has been dubbed ""Mr Passport"", is the chairman of Henley & Partners, one of the world's biggest players in this rapidly growing market. His global business helps wealthy individuals and their families acquire residency or citizenship in other countries. He says that our traditional notions of citizenship are ""outdated"". ""This is one of the few things left in the world that is tied to blood lines, or where you are born,"" he says. He argues that a rethink is very much due. ""It's super unfair,"" he says, explaining that where we are born is by no means down to our own skill or talent, but instead ""pure luck"". ""What is wrong with regarding citizenship like a membership,"" he adds. ""And what is wrong with admitting talented people who will contribute?"" There are those who support his argument. But for many, the idea that passports, so tied to identity, are in some way a commodity, doesn't sit well. We followed the citizenship trail to the tiny Pacific island nation of Vanuatu.  Since the country introduced its new citizenship scheme four years ago, it's seen an explosion of interest. Passports now provide the biggest source of its government's revenues.  For many aspiring Vanuatu passport holders, the biggest draw is visa-free travel throughout Europe.  Most foreign recipients of Vanuatu passports never even step foot in the country. Instead they apply for their citizenship in offices overseas, like the licensed Vanuatu citizenship broker PRG Consulting, based in Hong Kong.  Hong Kong is one of the world's biggest citizenship marketplaces. In a cafe at Hong Kong airport, we met the citizenship agent MJ, a private businessman who helps an increasing number of mainland Chinese obtain a second or even third passport.  ""They don't feel safe [in China],"" he says of his clients. ""They want access to Europe to open a bank account, to buy property or to start businesses."" Citizenship is a competitive global market, and for many small and island nations, notably in the Caribbean - the price for a passport is around $150,000. The cost of a Vanuatu passport is said to be around the same level. A Vanuatu passport, MJ explains, is ""so fast"" to arrange (you can get one in just 30 days), and that helps make it a popular choice. But Mr Kalin and others caution that Vanuatu has a reputation for corruption. As a result, Henley & Partners and others do not deal with the Vanuatu citizenship programme. However, this doesn't stop the interest from China. A few years ago Hong Kong television channels aired catchy TV advertisements promoting Vanuatu citizenship, aimed at the territory's steady flow of visitors from the mainland. So how many Chinese clients actually visit Vanuatu, after receiving citizenship? Maybe one in 10, guesses MJ.   Port Vila is the capital of Vanuatu, and a city of contrasts. The roads are often flooded and scarred with potholes. There's not a single set of traffic lights, but congestion is worsening thanks to the growing number of shiny four-wheel drives. It's a tax haven, and recently rejoined the EU's ""blacklist"" of countries, over transparency and corruption issues.  The country's people - known as Ni Vanuatu - were only officially recognised as citizens themselves in 1980, when the country achieved independence. Previously it was an Anglo-French condominium called the New Hebrides, and the people are scattered over a daisy chain of more than 80 islands. Less than 40 years ago, they were stateless. A fact not lost on former Prime Minister Barak Sope.  ""I didn't have a passport until 1980,"" he says, sitting in a hotel and casino on Port Vila's main road. ""I had to travel with a piece of paper the British and the French gave to me. It was humiliating.""  Mr Sope says it is a ""betrayal"" for Vanuatu to sell its citizenship, and points to the flood of Chinese investment in the region. ""The Chinese have so much more money than us,"" he says exasperated. The Chinese investment is criticised by locals such as Mr Sope, who complain that the Chinese companies keep all the money, and only employ Chinese labour. Vanuatu's all male government, one of only three countries in the world where women are entirely excluded from politics, was not keen to speak to us about its citizenship scheme. But we tracked down a government appointed citizenship agent, Bill Bani, who explains his take on the initiative. ""We have to look at Vanuatu on a global scale,"" he says. ""Other countries sell passports to make their living, we don't have a lot of natural resources.  It's bringing in a lot of money to Vanuatu."" But for the mainly rural population the policy has been highly controversial since its inception in 2015.  Anne Pakoa, a community leader, shows us around a typical village made up of corrugated iron shacks. It's just 10 minutes' drive down a dirt road from the shops and restaurants of the capital but feels a world away. Anne says that local communities aren't seeing the money from the passport sales, despite promises that the scheme would rebuild infrastructure and homes after the devastating Cyclone Pam in 2015.  ""Our ancestors died for our freedom. Now people are carrying the same green passport I carry? For $150,000? Where is the money? I think this has to stop,"" she says. Susan, another woman from the same village, shows us a dirty well. ""I want the government to provide a running tap, so that the children can have a shower, and drink clean and safe water,"" she says.  More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade: With demand from the Chinese market booming, Dan McGarry, who runs the local newspaper, says it will be hard to imagine a change in policy anytime soon.  Passport sales now account for more than 30% of the country's revenue, according to Dan. ""For a tiny country like ours this is a big deal. But we have to ask ourselves, is this what we fought for? Is this right? Is it right to sell our hard won sovereignty to the highest bidder?""  It's a question that many countries, not just Vanuatu, will have to grapple with in an increasingly globalised world. But as Mr Kalin, from Henley & Partners, says: ""Citizenship through investment, and investment migration programmes, are nothing but a reflection of a world where everything has become more fluid.""  Two radio documentaries that accompany this story are available on the BBC World Service - How To Buy Your Own Country and Passport To Paradise."
safe haven demand,Why is the US dollar so strong?,2024-09-15,2022-09-28,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63040797,"The US dollar is the strongest it's been for two decades, compared with other major currencies. This means it's more expensive to buy dollars, and dollars buy more pounds, euros or yen.  This affects businesses and households across the world.  The dollar index (DXY) - which measures the US dollar against an average of six other major currencies, including the euro, pound and yen - has risen 15% in 2022. By this measure, the dollar is at a 20-year high. The US central bank has increased interest rates several times this year to try and tackle rising prices.  This has pushed up the returns offered by financial products which use dollars such as US government bonds.  Bonds are a way for governments (and companies) to borrow money, which they promise to repay with interest in the future. Government bonds are generally considered very safe.  Investors from across the world have recently been buying billions of dollars of US bonds. They have to spend dollars to purchase these bonds, and the extra demand has pushed up the dollar's value.  When investors sell other currencies to buy dollars, they drop in value.  Investors also tend to buy dollars when the global economy is under pressure, because the size of the US makes its currency a ""safe haven"". That also puts the price up. Many economies in Europe and Asia are struggling as a result of soaring gas prices caused by the conflict in Ukraine.  The US hasn't been hit as hard by rising energy prices. Although its economy has shrunk in the last six months, businesses are still taking on staff, which is seen as a sign of continuing confidence.   The pound hit a record low against the dollar on 26 September, falling to $1.03. It has since recovered a little. It has fallen by 20% in value against the US dollar since start of the year. The pound's biggest slump followed a mini-budget in which the Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng outlined a £45bn package of tax cuts, as well as energy subsidies for businesses and households. He also indicated there would be more tax cuts to come.  Many investors sold UK government bonds, and other UK financial assets, because of fears the chancellor's measures would cause government borrowing to surge to unsustainable levels. This made the pound drop in value. Like Sterling, the Japanese yen has fallen 20% in value against the dollar, while the euro has fallen by 15%.  Countries with weaker currencies can benefit from a strong dollar because it makes the goods and services they sell to the US cheaper, which boosts exports.  However, it also means goods imported from the States become more expensive. Since oil is priced in US dollars, petrol now costs more in many countries around the globe. In Britain, for example, the average price of a litre of petrol has increased from £1.46 to £1.67 since the start of the year - a rise of 15%.  It peaked at £1.91 in July.  Governments and firms in many countries also often borrow money in US dollars rather than their own currencies because it tends to be more stable.  As the dollar increases in value, it becomes more expensive to repay those debts with local currency. Argentina's government has been hit particularly hard by the stronger dollar.  It has temporarily banned various imported goods, including yachts and whisky to try to protect its financial reserves.  Many countries around the world are trying to boost the value of their own currencies by putting up interest rates. The UK has increased its main rate by 2 percentage points, so far. The Bank of England says that further rises are likely, with many analysts predicting interest rates could rise as high as 6 percent.   The European Central Bank has increased its interest rate by 1.25 percentage points.  Raising interest rates helps to hold down rising prices, but also makes it more expensive for businesses and households to borrow money.  This helps hold down rising prices, but it also means that firms struggle to stay profitable, and may lay off staff. Families may also cut back on spending.  In turn, this can cause countries to slip into recession, meaning the economy shrinks.  Even before the recent drop in the value of the pound, the Bank of England had warned that the UK may already be in recession. "
safe haven demand,Oil on stormy market waters,2024-09-15,2020-05-19,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-52718928,"Tuesday 19 May: pencilled in to my diary as a day to watch for oil market chaos. I'll have to focus on the new job figures instead, because the oil market is on the up. The warning of chaos came a month ago, when the US benchmark price went negative. Global supply was vastly outstripping demand. Storage tanks at Cushing, Oklahoma - the hub for storing the region's oil - were either filling up, or booked up. And in a quirk of America's oil market, the monthly closure of delivery contracts arrived with a lot of traders unable to store the black stuff. So they had to pay to offload it. With even more supply and even less storage by mid-May, things were set fair for more of the same mayhem. But things have changed. The price of West Texas Intermediate benchmark crude has risen from below $20, when the mayhem subsided a month ago, to nearly $33 per barrel, surging 12% for good measure on Monday. Brent crude, the North Sea cocktail that serves as a benchmark for the rest of the world, was also up by nearly 8%, trading around $35. The last time they were close to these levels was mid-March, on a rapid descent because Opec had failed to agree with Russia on cutting production, and both Europe and North America were heading towards lockdown. What things have changed? There's more demand than there was. China and its neighbours have fired up their economies to some extent. Europe and North America are beginning to do so. Monday's stock markets were also buoyed by a more positive vibe from eased lockdown and a supportive US Fed. Supply has been cut. The eventual agreement between the Opec oil exporter cartel and non-member Russia was not enough last month, but Saudis added a further tranche of production cuts. There's still an imbalance, and the price is still lower than producers want or need it to be. But it looks stabilised for now. One of the most significant parts of the supply cut was in the US. America doesn't have an autocrat's power to turn the taps. A historic quirk of the Texas oil industry is that it's regulated by the Texas Railroad Commission. It met early this month, and opted not to impose any restraints. That's because the price was restraining enough. Fracking is a boom and bust technology. In March, production was very strong. The USA had become the world's biggest oil producer. But by the middle of this month, it had lost two-thirds of the temporary drilling rigs used to frack for oil and gas, and counted weekly by industry data specialist Baker Hughes. That is going to hurt those who invested in the US boom, but it's good news for other producers who needed prices to rise.  Effectively, it means the US has become the swing producer. Instead of the Saudi-led Opec cartel controlling the taps and therefore the price, the price has become the mechanism for Texan and Dakotan drillers to match demand with supply. There is one other element worth noting about the decreased volatility from last month. Industry analysts explain much of the plunge into negative prices by reference to speculative flows of investment funds. There are moves afoot to limit the ability of investors to move US markets that way - though they were also afoot 12 years ago, when speculators drove the price up to a $145 spike. That matters because volatility directly affects investment decisions by oil companies, and that feeds through to jobs. A lot of jobs. President Trump is aware of that in an election year. He performed an impressive contortion last week, with a Tweet that welcomed both rising crude prices - meaning jobs, and low fuel costs, which has felt like a tax cut. It also matters because speculators can disrupt markets for other commodities that are important to the world economy. That could include food, which saw a period of global market volatility during the financial crisis in 2008, and left a lot of people hungry. One commodity that is always there at times of crisis, as a safe haven in an investment storm, is gold. It doesn't earn you anything, but it's rare and it doesn't corrode. It's been on the rise in recent weeks, now trading at its highest levels since 2012, above $1.750 per ounce."
safe haven demand,The effect of war on food prices,2024-09-15,2022-03-07,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-60644376,"The prospect of an oil embargo on Russia, at least for its US and European customers, has sent the price soaring once more. Four months ago, the price of Brent crude was below $70 per barrel. Last week, it rose 21%. As the new week's trading began in Australia, the price of benchmark Brent crude surged 10%, hitting $130 per barrel. Traders are reported saying it could surge through the $147.50 record price set in the turmoil of 2008. A lot of that can be explained by comments on Sunday made by Antony Blinken, the US Secretary of State, saying in an NBC interview: ""We are now in very active discussions with our European partners about banning the import of Russian oil to our countries, while of course, at the same time, maintaining a steady global supply of oil"". The discomfort of imposing sanctions while continuing to send $1bn per day to Russia to pay for its oil and gas (Russia supplies 8% of US oil demand) is turning the tide towards sanctions that could bite very hard in fuel prices for Europe, the US and beyond. The concern in Europe is about losing the supply of Russia's natural gas.  Its price ended last week on a spectacular surge, beating the record set in December, and getting very close to £5 per therm. Its trend level before it began to rise in the middle of last year was around 40p. But it's not just energy. Where raw materials are treated and traded as global commodities, war in Ukraine has sent other prices sharply up, and stock markets down. Reuters reports that last week saw nickel rise 19%, aluminium by 15%, zinc was up 12%, and copper increased 8%. In precious metals too, gold is up, partly because investors see it as a safe haven. And palladium is one to watch.  Russia has 40% of global production. The rare metal, at more than $3,000 per ounce, has catalytic uses in car engines and industry. Prices last week were up 25%. The one to watch for all of us, even in the world's poorer households where they have little concern about the price of gas for heating or oil for cars, is food. Securing a futures contract to supply wheat saw a 60% surge last week, and corn was up 15%. Russia and Ukraine together account for around 30% of internationally traded wheat. Not much comes to Europe, instead going from Black Sea ports to the Middle East and Africa.  However, several ports are shut due to the war, and Ukraine's land infrastructure is being pounded by Russian shells. As a globally traded commodity, that supply disruption means the price goes up for everyone. Conflict in Ukraine is far from being the only pressure on food prices. They were rising anyway.  Extreme weather has disrupted crop growth with torrential rain in Germany, excessive heat in Canada and drought in parts of South America. Climate modellers are telling us to get used to that, and to plan agriculture to meet the growing challenge. It is pointed out that lower harvests hit prices, and therefore affect poorest households first. Those modellers forecast a reversal in the falling number of people, over recent decades, who are unable to afford sufficient food energy to avoid malnutrition, affecting as many as 80 million people. Food prices have been affected by Covid. Some produce has lacked the migrant farm labour to harvest it, from Malaysian palm oil to Scottish berries. Easing of infection restrictions has seen demand come back, and that pushes up prices. Supply chains have been disrupted, linked to much higher costs of sea-going freight. Machinery costs have been rising steeply, where the chip shortage affecting car production has also extended to increasingly sophisticated tractors. Rising energy prices have fed through to higher transport costs of reaching market, and much higher fertilizer prices. Natural gas is a necessary input for ammonia and nitrates. These are not costs that farmers can easily pass on to customers.  The market sets the price. But if fertilizer becomes more expensive, less is used, yields fall, so that total supply falls too, and after some time, prices go up. Global food prices are tracked by the United Nations' farming division, the Food and Agriculture Organisation. The monthly figures just published show sugar was the only major farm produce to see a fall in price between January and February, though it is up 10% on February 2021. The inflation of other prices was picking up pace, and most of the data was collected before Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine. The FAO food price index was up 20.7% on February last year, and nearly 4% in one month. Meat was up 15% in the year, driven by increased demand for beef and pork. Dairy rose by 25%, aided by lower than expected milk supply in Western Europe and Oceania. Neither is thought to reflect disruption by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. But while tensions built on the border, cereal prices were rising by 3% between January and February, and by 15% over the preceding year. And as Russia produces around 80% of the world's vegetable oils, that helps explain an 8.5% rise in one month, according to the FAO, and 37% over the year. Next months' figures will include the impact on prices from a hot war starting, and traders adjusting to the disruption of supply of Ukrainian and Russian farm produce, as well as shipping. But consumers don't need to wait. They can already see prices rising.  Britain's consumer price inflation rate has already hit 5.5%. War has uprated economists' predictions of where it will peak, to forecasts north of 8% and even as high as 10%. The US is already well ahead, with inflation in the year to January at 7.5%, the highest for 40 years. The February figure is issued on Thursday, and the US Fed, America's central bank, is expected to raise interest rates a week later. Inflation has become a highly salient political issue for President Joe Biden in his mid-term election year, not least for the cost of filling a car with gasoline. The price of a gallon is up, on average, 45% since last year, according to the American Automobile Association, and 11% in the past week to $4 (£3.03). In the UK, transport fuel costs were already higher, due to tax. And due to tax, they don't increase at the same pace as the crude oil price. However, the cost of a litre of unleaded it's hitting record prices every day, and the shock to the system of the Ukraine invasion won't be felt for some weeks. More politically salient, at least for now, is the rising cost of household energy, up 54% in April and by another whopping increase in October, when the price cap is adjusted. Perhaps if it went up incrementally, it would be less noticeable and less awkward for the government. The rising cost of food will also bring the Ukraine war into every household budget, and put pressure on governments to respond."
safe haven demand,NZ to allow in pregnant reporter helped by Taliban,2024-09-15,2022-02-01,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-60211703,"A pregnant New Zealand journalist who said she turned to the Taliban for help after being unable to return home has been granted re-entry after an outcry. Charlotte Bellis said she had flown to Afghanistan after being unable to get an entry spot under New Zealand's strict Covid border rules. Her story highlighted Wellington's tough border measures which are designed to keep out the coronavirus. But others took issue with her privileged connections to the Taliban. The Taliban has been regularly criticised for brutally clamping down on women's rights in recent months. They have been accused of arresting, torturing and even killing activists and campaigners.  On Tuesday, following significant public attention around the case, the New Zealand government said they had offered a quarantine spot to Ms Bellis and set up flight arrangements. ""There is a place in managed isolation and quarantine for Ms Bellis and I urge her to take it up,"" Deputy Prime Minister Grant Robertson told reporters at a daily Covid briefing. He denied that the action had come as a result of the attention on her case, saying staff dealt daily with emergency applications.  ""They always try to make contact with people and try to make arrangements work."" The New Zealand government had previously said it had twice offered consular assistance to Ms Bellis, who wrote about her experience in a national newspaper on Saturday. In her column for the New Zealand Herald, Ms Bellis said the government had last week rejected her application to return home to give birth.  Currently, Wellington allows citizens and permanent residents to enter, but only if they spend 10 days isolating in quarantine hotels.  As there is high demand for such facilities and a limited number of spots, many New Zealanders wishing to return have effectively been shut out of their country for about two years now. She compared that experience to the way she was treated by the Taliban, whom she had contacted to ask if she would be welcome in Afghanistan as an unmarried pregnant woman. When she spoke to senior Taliban officials, Ms Bellis was in Belgium with her partner, a Belgian photojournalist. However, the time on her visa was running out as she was not a resident there. Afghanistan was the only place she and her partner had visas for, as they had been in Afghanistan last year covering the withdrawal of US troops.  ""You can come and you won't have a problem. Just tell people you're married and if it escalates, call us,"" Ms Bellis quoted the unnamed officials as saying in response to her request. ""When the Taliban offers you - a pregnant, unmarried woman - safe haven, you know your situation is messed up,"" she wrote.  Single Afghan mothers have reported being frequently harassed by Taliban officials, pressured to give up their children, and having their custodial rights threatened. After Ms Bellis' letter was published, there were calls for New Zealand authorities to adjust the emergency quarantine allocation criteria to specifically cater for pregnant women.  Authorities defended the policy on Monday, saying the system had ""served New Zealand exceptionally well, saved lives and hospital admissions and kept our health system from being swamped"". The government also said Ms Bellis had been advised to apply for a visa again under a separate emergency category. It's unclear if that took place, or if she has now been granted entry under her original application. Ms Bellis had said that she had also been offered asylum in another unnamed country since going public with her struggle.  However, her story has been criticised by some observers, rights activists and Afghans themselves.  ""The story is just a continuation of how non-Afghans are treated differently by the Taliban ... than Afghans,"" tweeted Austrian-Afghan journalist Emran Feroz.  ""Journalists who were seen as Afghans often faced threats, beatings, torture and murder while non-Afghans ... had tons of privileges and were welcomed and treated softly by all sides,"" he added.  Most recently, there have been calls for the Taliban to release a number of women's rights activists who have not been seen after their homes were raided and they were arrested."
safe haven demand,HK suspends controversial extradition bill,2024-09-15,2019-06-15,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-48645342,"The Hong Kong government has suspended its highly controversial plan to allow extraditions to mainland China, Chief Executive Carrie Lam has announced. She had previously refused to scrap the bill despite mass protests from Hong Kong residents. ""I feel deep sorrow and regret that deficiencies in our work – and various other factors – have stirred up substantial controversies,"" she said. Protesters expressed concern at increased Chinese influence.  Ms Lam said she had heard the calls for her government to ""pause and think"". She also admitted that the ""explanation and communication"" of the bill had not been adequate. She said her goal was ""the greatest interests of Hong Kong"", which involved first restoring peace and order. The government had argued the proposed extradition bill would ""plug the loopholes"" so that the city would not be a safe haven for criminals, following a murder case in Taiwan. Ms Lam said that the urgency felt to pass the bill before the legislative year ends ""perhaps no longer exists"". No date has been set for ""the next step forward"", she said. Hundreds of thousands of people have protested against the bill and further demonstrations were planned for Sunday. Critics have said the legislation would expose people in Hong Kong to China's deeply flawed justice system and lead to further erosion of the city's judicial independence. Protest leaders said that despite Ms Lam's announcement, they would continue their demonstrations until the bill was cancelled, not just delayed. Analysis by Helier Cheung, BBC News, Hong Kong It was a striking U-turn from a leader who previously struck a defiant tone. Mere days ago, Ms Lam had vowed to press ahead with the unpopular legislation – now she has promised to ""listen to different views from society"". But for many protesters, the damage has already been done, and the move to delay - but not cancel - the legislation is unlikely to assuage their concerns. One protester told me he believed the government was ""trying to divert attention away until opposition calms down - and then they'll try to re-do the whole process again"". Others said they would still take part in a march against the proposal planned for Sunday. ""Our final goal is to cancel the law, not to pause it. I think there will still be many people coming out tomorrow,"" a student leader told me.   Hong Kong is a former British colony, but was returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a ""one country, two systems"" deal that guarantees it a level of autonomy. China's foreign ministry publicly backed Ms Lam after her announcement. ""The Chinese Central Government expresses its support, respect and understanding for the [Hong Kong] government's decision,"" spokesman Geng Shuang said in a statement. Amid the international debate on Hong Kong, he also warned that its ""affairs are purely China's internal affairs that brook no interference from any country, organization or individual"". Conversely, Britain's Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt applauded the Hong Kong government for ""heeding concerns of the brave citizens"" who objected to the changes. The changes would allow for criminal extradition requests from authorities in mainland China, Taiwan and Macau - decided on a case-by-case basis by Hong Kong courts. Hong Kong officials, including Ms Lam, say the bill is necessary to protect the city against criminals. But many fear the law could be used to target political opponents of the Chinese state. Opposition activists also cite the alleged use of torture, arbitrary detentions and forced confessions in mainland China. It comes after a high-profile case where a Hong Kong man was accused of murdering his girlfriend on holiday in Taiwan but could not be extradited. Yet Taiwanese officials are against the changes - due to their own concerns about the impact they could have.  Taiwan is in effect independent, but China considers it a breakaway province. The government there has even said it would not accept the extradition of the accused man if it was under the proposed new rules. ""I'm deeply upset by the assault on freedom and human rights in Hong Kong,"" Taiwan's Foreign Minister, Joseph Wu, tweeted. ""Chief Executive Carrie Lam must listen to the people and take full responsibility. Blaming Taiwan is immoral, shameful and unacceptable. Embrace democracy and stand on the right side of history!"" A large-scale march, which organisers said drew more than one million people, was held last Sunday. Then on Wednesday tens of thousands gathered to blockade streets around government headquarters to try to stop the second reading, or debate, of the extradition bill. Tensions boiled over and 22 police and 60 protesters were injured. Authorities say 11 people were arrested. The police, who used tear gas and rubber bullets, have been accused of excessive force by some rights groups.  Until Saturday's announcement, Ms Lam had not spoken publicly since she labelled the protests ""organised riots"" during a tearful address. Hong Kong was a British colony from 1841, when China ceded the island to the British after the First Opium War - which had erupted over British traders smuggling opium into China. It remained a colony until sovereignty was returned to China in 1997.  It is now part of China under a ""one country, two systems"" principle, which ensures that it keeps its own judicial independence, its own legislature and economic system. It is what China calls a special administrative region - enjoying a great deal of autonomy that has made it a key business and media hub in the region. But it remains subject to pressure from mainland China, and Beijing remains responsible for defence and foreign affairs. People in Hong Kong are worried that the extradition bill could bring Hong Kong more decisively under China's control. Hong Kong officials had said its courts would have the final say whether to grant extradition requests. Ms Lam's government had also said suspects accused of political and religious crimes would not be extradited, insisting legally binding human rights safeguards would also be in place."
safe haven demand,Trade war fears send shudder through stock markets,2024-09-15,2019-08-05,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-49234068,"Fears of a US-China trade war sent shudders through US and European stock markets on Monday, with Wall Street recording its worst day of 2019. The Dow Jones and S&P 500 fell 3%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq shed 3.5%. It followed comments from President Donald Trump who accused Beijing of currency manipulation. The Chinese yuan passed the seven-per-dollar level for the first time since 2008 - which surprised traders as Beijing usually supports the currency. In Europe, the FTSE 100 closed 2.5% lower, while the main markets in Germany and France dropped around 2%. Major exporters such as construction equipment maker Caterpillar and plane manufacturer Boeing fell 2.5%, while Apple was among the biggest casualties, sinking 5.2%.  Few sectors were left unscathed, with Nike and Macy's both seeing their respective share prices drop by around 3% each. Gold was trading at more than a six-year high on Monday, as investors put money into so-called safe haven assets. The Japanese yen and government bonds also rose as investors sought to cut back on risk. The VIX volatility index, the so-called fear measure among investors, jumped 36%. ""Any hopes of a quick resolution with China are fading quickly,"" said Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist at LPL Financial. Harry Tchilinguirian, global oil strategist at BNP Paribas, added: ""The escalation of trade measures only reinforces concerns over global economic growth."" Crude oil prices fell - Brent crude was down 2.5% to $60.36 per barrel, while US West Texas Intermediate fell 1.7%, to $54.69. The market moves come amid rising trade tension between the US and China. Chinese authorities said on Friday that they would fight back against Mr Trump's decision to impose 10% tariffs on $300bn of Chinese imports. Mr Trump's move brought an end to a month-long trade truce, which he cemented on Monday when the president started tweeting about the yuan's move. He tweeted it was ""currency manipulation"" which would ""greatly weaken China"". The US Treasury department defines currency manipulation as when ""countries manipulate the rate of exchange between their currency and the United States dollar for purposes of preventing effective balance of payments adjustment or gaining unfair competitive advantage in international trade"". No country has officially been named a currency manipulator by the US since Bill Clinton's administration did so to China in 1994. China's central bank said it was not using its yuan currency as a tool to cope with external disturbances such as trade disputes.  The yuan's exchange rate now was at an appropriate level in line with China's economic fundamentals and market demand and supply, it added. In offshore markets, the yuan fell to its weakest since international trading in the Chinese currency began.  It now takes 7.0835 yuan to buy a dollar. The currency, down 1.5% in offshore markets, is heading for its biggest one-day drop in four years. There are two yuan markets. The offshore one - based in places such as Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, and London - doesn't fluctuate within a tight band like the onshore yuan market and is free of Beijing's control in that respect. ""The fallout has been most evident in the Asia region,"" MUFG analyst Derek Halpenny said.  ""We certainly expect to see general FX volatility increase in the coming days, with daily PBOC [People's Bank of China] yuan fixes an important focus each day.""  While other Asian currencies such as the South Korean won were hit, falling 1.4% against the dollar, it also spurred demand for safe-haven currencies such as the Swiss franc and Japanese yen. The breaching of the seven-per-dollar limit could lead to a flight out of domestic assets. In the last decade, there have been two periods of yuan weakness, in 2010 and a slower contraction between 2014 and 2016. Those incidents precipitated bursts of capital flight that distorted the Chinese economy and forced the authorities to prop up the currency by using capital controls and purchases by state-run banks. Meanwhile, Chinese seed and food company shares and rare-earth firms were boosted on hopes that Beijing will not buy more from the US."
safe haven demand,TSB offers safe spaces for domestic abuse victims,2024-09-15,2021-05-11,By Simon Read,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-57077945,"Domestic abuse victims will be able to use ""safe spaces"" in nearly 300 TSB branches to get specialist support, the bank has said. People will be able to get help as lockdown restrictions ease, TSB said. The scheme has been trialled in branches in Worcestershire, Herefordshire and Shropshire. The initiative, run by domestic abuse charity Hestia, is already in place in more than 5,300 pharmacies across the country. The Safe Spaces scheme gives victims somewhere to phone a helpline, contact a support service or talk to a friend or family member. People can also speak to a trained staff member or contact the local police if necessary. ""Businesses have a unique role in breaking the silence around domestic abuse,"" said Sue Harper, head of domestic abuse prevention at Hestia. ""By providing a safe space in their banks, TSB will help us reach many more victims of domestic abuse, ensuring they get the specialist help and advice they need."" TSB workers have been given specialist training to increase their confidence in responding to disclosures of domestic abuse. The national rollout of the scheme follows a six-month pilot. ""During lockdown victims of domestic abuse have had fewer opportunities to seek help safely,"" said Carol Anderson, director of TSB's branch network.  ""For some, going into their local bank will be one of the few connections they have with the wider community."" The Safe Spaces scheme was launched by Hestia in the middle of lockdown last May after it realised victims needed a way to get to specialist support. It was first launched in partnership with Boots and, with the addition of TSB, is now available in more than 5,600 locations across the UK. Major brands such as Superdrug, Morrisons and Well pharmacies, as well as local independent pharmacists, are involved. ""The last year has been extremely difficult for everyone, but even more so for domestic abuse victims who have often been trapped in lockdown for months on end with perpetrators,"" said Domestic Abuse Commissioner, Nicole Jacobs.  ""Getting help has been nigh on impossible for many but some of the survivors were offered a lifeline by the Safe Spaces scheme."" Last year, at the height of lockdown in June, calls and contacts to Refuge's National Domestic Abuse Helpline were nearly 80% higher than usual. When lockdown measures started to tighten in November, Hestia said it saw a 30% increase in demand for its services. It said the majority of the Safe Spaces set up at pharmacies across the country have been used by victims. ""Women or men who have been 'forced' to be indoors with an abusive partner or family member really need a safe haven where they can retreat to collect their thoughts and get support,"" said Sara (not her real name), a survivor of domestic abuse.  ""Sometimes getting out of that bubble of abuse, that you are in at home, helps you to realise that help is out there.  ""An abuser wouldn't really think that their victim could access help at their local bank or pharmacy so being able to contact a domestic violence helpline in this way will be life changing for many."" If you or someone you know need support, you can visit https://www.bright-sky.org.uk/ to find your nearest local support or download the Bright Sky app to your phone.  To find your nearest Safe Space locations go to https://uksaysnomore.org/safespaces/  Refuge's National Domestic Abuse Helpline is on 0808 2000 247 and is available 24 hours a day seven days a week for free, confidential specialist support.

safe haven demand,Everyone wrong on Afghanistan - UK military chief,2024-09-15,2021-09-05,By Francesca Gillett,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-58453258,"""Everybody got it wrong"" on how quickly the Taliban would take over Afghanistan, the head of Britain's armed forces has said. Gen Sir Nick Carter told the BBC: ""It was the pace of it that surprised us and I don't think we realised quite what the Taliban were up to."" Asked whether military intelligence was wrong, he said the government received intelligence from a variety of sources. ""It's not purely about military intelligence,"" he said.  The last British and US troops left Afghanistan a week ago, bringing their 20-year military campaign in the country to an end. There has been criticism of the way the West withdrew from Afghanistan, with questions over how the Taliban was able to seize control of the country at such speed.   Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told MPs last week the intelligence assessment had been that there would be a ""steady deterioration"" in the security situation in August but it was ""unlikely Kabul would fall this year"". However, the Taliban took over Kabul in mid-August. Speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr show on Sunday, Sir Nick was asked how the predictions had been wrong. ""I think everybody got it wrong is the straight answer,"" he said. ""Even the Taliban didn't expect things to change as quickly as they did."" The chief of the defence staff said: ""I don't think what anybody predicted was how fragile that Afghan government was and how fragile it was in relation to the command of its armed forces."" The Taliban is expected to announce a new government in the coming days, meaning foreign powers will have to adapt to the prospect of dealing with a Taliban administration. Sir Nick said it was too early to say how the Taliban would govern, but there was a possibility the militant group would be less repressive than it was in the past.  ""On the face of it, it doesn't look good at the moment. But let's see what happens. It may well change,"" he said. ""I also think they're not stupid enough to [not] know the Afghan people have changed and they want a slightly different sort of governance."" On Sunday, the Taliban was accused of murdering a female police officer. The killing comes amid reports the group is escalating its repression of women. Sir Nick said it was now down to the international community to encourage the Taliban to govern in a different way, he added. ""They're going to need a bit of help to run a modern state effectively,"" he said. ""If they behave, perhaps they'll get some help."" Asked whether military intelligence was wrong, Sir Nick said: ""No... many of the assessments suggested it wouldn't last the course of the year and, of course, that's proven to be correct."" He said: ""It's a much broader thing than just strictly military intelligence. ""The way it works in this country is we have the joint intelligence committee which sits inside the Cabinet Office. So what they do is pull together the sources from the Ministry of Defence, the Foreign Office, the inter-agencies and the secret intelligence services and wider open source material."" Currently, Taliban soldiers are fighting resistance groups in Panjshir Valley, the last remaining part of Afghanistan which the Taliban does not yet control. On Saturday, the top US general said that civil war was likely to erupt in Afghanistan, and those conditions could lead to a resurgence of terrorist groups there. Gen Mark Milley told Fox News: ""The conditions are very likely that you could see a resurgence of terrorism coming out of that general region within 12, 24, 36 months."" Sir Nick told the BBC the risk of terrorism will depend on whether an effective government can be formed in Afghanistan.  Labour's shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy said there was a strong possibility that Britain may now be less safe because of the events in Afghanistan. ""The urgent task for the government... is to make sure Afghanistan doesn't collapse once again into a haven of terrorism,"" she said. She called on the UK to work with other countries - not just its allies - to take a common approach towards the Taliban, and use their leverage to demand rights for women and girls living in Afghanistan. Earlier, former MI6 chief Sir Alex Younger, who stepped down from his role last year, told Times Radio that having no physical presence in Afghanistan would be a ""blow"" to intelligence networks.  And he added that ""turning our back"" on a place like Afghanistan ""leads inexorably to an increase in the threat to our country""."
safe haven demand,Why has the pound tumbled?,2024-09-15,2019-08-02,By Tom Edgington,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-49179234,"The value of the pound has fallen to a record low against the dollar. It has also fallen against the euro. It comes after the UK government announced large tax cuts, to be paid for by borrowing billions of pounds.  The pound's value affects everyone - from shoppers to business owners and investors.  This is because when the pound is worth less, the cost of goods imported from overseas goes up. For example: Even things made in the UK can cost more if parts are bought from other countries. And the pound's value has an impact when you travel abroad. If it buys less of the local currency, then things will be more expensive. Overall, the falling pound could increase the cost of living by 0.5 percentage points next year, according to Samuel Tombs of research firm Pantheon Economics. A weak pound can, however, boost businesses which export to other countries as their goods become cheaper and more attractive to foreign buyers. Investors around the world buy and sell huge amounts of foreign currency. The aim is to profit by buying a currency that goes up in value more than the one sold. The pound plummeted on Friday after the government announced huge tax cuts in its mini-budget.  It then plunged again in on Monday, reaching $1.04 - the lowest level the pound has ever been against the dollar. The cause is investors selling the pound because they have doubts about the government's plans, said Jane Foley, of Rabobank. ""They're worried that some of these tax cuts that have been announced aren't going to be fully funded,"" she said.  These same concerns have also pushed up the cost of government borrowing. The interest on 10-year bonds - which governments sell to investors - has risen from just over 1% in January, to more than 4% now. Some investors believe the government's tax cuts will lead to people spending more, which will push up prices. So in an effort to limit price rises, the Bank would raise interest rates sooner and faster.    However, raising rates could leave people with less money, as mortgages and loans become more expensive. ""The markets have decided that [Mr] Kwarteng's tax cuts will lead to higher interest rates and that a deterioration in the public finances will undermine the UK's long-term growth prospects"", said Paul Dales from Capital Economics. The Bank of England isn't set to hold its next interest rate meeting until November, but there is speculation it could act sooner.  In a statement on Twitter, the Bank said it was monitoring developments and would ""not hesitate to change interest rates by as much as needed to return inflation to the 2% target"". The dollar has also performed well against other countries' currencies. Only 24 have outperformed it since the start of the year. However, the pound has fallen more than 20% against the dollar this year, putting it among the 20 worst performing currencies. Among the currencies that have performed worse are the Argentine peso (-27%) and the Turkish lira (-29%). The euro has also fallen against the dollar, by 15% over the same period - the two currencies had the same value this year for the first time in over two decades.  The pound is down against the euro over the same period. Compared with India's rupee, the pound is down by 13% since the start of the year. The fall in the pound comes after a surge in the US dollar's value; Part of the reason is down to the US being less exposed to high energy prices caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine.  As such, the US is considered more of a safe haven for investors. Exchange rates -the rates at which currencies are bought and sold - change constantly. They are affected by lots of things, including: What is GDP and how does it affect me? Has your business been affected by the falling value of the pound?

safe haven demand,How solar may save a nuclear wasteland,2024-09-15,2017-01-30,Peter Ray Allison,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20170127-how-solar-may-save-ukraines-nuclear-wasteland,"The Ukrainian government wants to turn part of the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone into a solar farm. Could the site of the world's worst nuclear accident get a new lease of life? In April 1986, the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant suffered a catastrophic meltdown. The resulting explosion released some of the reactor core into the atmosphere, creating the worst nuclear accident in history. The subsequent radioactive fallout – some of which fell as far as Wales – resulted in the Exclusion Zone being formed around Chernobyl. The Chernobyl Exclusion Zone today covers an area of 1,000 square miles (2,600 sq km), including an area that was once home to 120,000 people, most of whom lived in the now abandoned cities of Pripyat and Chernobyl. The Exclusion Zone remains in effect, as the area is considered too contaminated for residential or agricultural use. Despite the meltdown in Reactor 4, Reactors 1-3 of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant continued to be operated, because Ukraine needed the energy. Reactor 3 was only decommissioned in December 2000.  Apart from a handful of radiation hot-spots, the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone has become a comparatively safe area to visit, as long as you’re staying for only a short time. Due to significant interest in the area, as well as the unique biodiversity there, the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone was officially declared a tourist attraction in 2011. And with the successful installation of the new sarcophagus, which will seal in the damaged reactor for 100 years, the disaster site is about to see renewed activity. Earlier this year Ostap Semerak, the minister for ecology and natural resources in Ukraine, announced plans to build a large-scale solar farm in Chernobyl’s Exclusion Zone. “The first phase will install solar panels with a total capacity of one gigawatt,” says a ministry spokesperson. “In the future [there] are plans for capacity increase.” A large field of 25 acres, filled with solar panels, generates approximately 5MW. To put this into perspective, the football pitch at Manchester United’s Old Trafford ground is 1.75 acres and would only generate 0.35MW. So, for a solar farm to generate a gigawatt of power, it will need an area of 5,000 acres, which is nearly eight square miles. There is, fortunately, a lot of available land in the Exclusion Zone. The idea of building a solar farm in the Exclusion Zone has merit. “The decision is based on the presence of a network of electric power lines, which are hardly loaded, and their proximity makes it possible to connect to the power grid at minimal cost,” says a spokesperson from the ministry. Along with the existing high-voltage infrastructure, there is an existing population trained in power plant operation, and the area can’t be used for agriculture because of the residual fallout. Solar panels generate electricity from the Sun’s photons, storing electrons within a top layer of silicon that then flow to another silicon layer on the bottom, generating an electric current. “Solar panels are relatively complex in their manufacture but are relatively simple in their form and resistance to interference or deterioration,” says Alan Thomson, the global head of energy for Arup. This makes solar panels ideal for power generation in remote or hard-to-reach areas. There are over 40 different types of solar panel technology available, and whilst they operate in effectively the same way, some are more efficient. In cases such as the Exclusion Zone, where there is lots of space, the Ukrainian government will most likely be seeking cost-effective methods for using the most durable types of solar panel technology. The exact solution will be determined once the feasibility study is completed. The Chernobyl Exclusion Zone lies on approximately the same latitude as southern England. This location offers excellent solar power generation during the summer months, but less so during winter. Building a solar farm capable of generating 1GW in the Exclusion Zone will present a series of engineering challenges, however. The first key point will be determining where exactly to build the solar farm. There are various points that will need to be considered, the primary issue being the need to avoid any radiation hot spots. These radiation hot spots are already quite reliably mapped out. Although solar panels will not be affected, there is always the possibility that workers could be exposed to high radiation levels during installation or subsequent maintenance, either onsite or travelling within the zone. Since radioactive isotopes from the Chernobyl accident have now seeped into the soil, engineers must avoid disturbing the ground as much as they can. “Screw-piles, which are giant corkscrews which provide the foundation, rather than digging a hole for a big lump of concrete” could be one way to install the panels without disturbing too much soil, says Thomson. Another issue will be keeping the solar panels clean so they work as efficiently as possible. Given the environment, solar panels will need to be installed at a 30-degree angle so they can shed snow, which will also have a cleaning effect as it slides off. Many solar panels also use special coatings that make dust collection less of an issue than it was in the past. The solar farm will also need a transformer to “step-up” the electrical output from the farm to the 750V used by the Ukrainian energy grid.  “The output from the nuclear power plant would not be comparable to the solar panels,” says Thomson. “You will need to put in some form of substation to step-up transforming capability.” However, building a new substation may involve digging foundations, which could then potentially disturb the ground contaminants. There would also be environmental considerations, as there has been significant interest in the area’s biodiversity as it recovers from the 1986 accident. Since the disaster, when tens of thousands of residents were evacuated, the Exclusion Zone has become a haven for wildlife.  Existing animal populations have flourished and some rare species, such as Przewalski's horses, have returned. “You would want to be careful to not be encountering environmental objections because you are interfering with something that people did not want in the first place, but they are quite interested now that it is there,” says Thomson. One of the key advantages of solar farms is that they can be monitored remotely, meaning the on-site personnel will not be required to perform inspections. Solar panels can be checked off-site to assess their performance. Once a certain number of solar panels need to be replaced, a maintenance team can be sent with precise details of which panels are to be replaced and where they can be found, minimising their time spent in the Exclusion Zone. One of the greatest problems of solar panels is that they only generate energy during the day, which is naturally far less during the winter months. This could be offset by storing any excess energy generated during the day. One such way this could be achieved is through using the pump storage hydro scheme located in the nearby city of Dniester, which is expected to be finished in 2017. Pump storage hydro is used to store energy using the gravitational potential energy of water. Excess energy within the grid is used to pump water into the upper reservoir. During periods of high demand, the stored water is released, powering turbines to produce hydro-electric power. Looking to the future, it would not be surprising if other forms of renewable energy are employed. “The implementation of solar energy projects is one of the development priorities of the Exclusion Zone,” says the ministry’s spokesperson, “but not excluding other forms if they are attractive to investors, [such as] wind power and biofuels.” “At some stage, they will want to look at a mix, in terms of getting that diversity,” says Thomson.  “Wind farms can generate electricity when solar farms cannot, such as night.” However, wind farms present their own problems, most notably the invasive foundations which need to be built – a no-go in the radioactive Exclusion Zone. The Ukrainian government is currently at the “pre-study and preparation phase”, and are in talks with investment firms and energy developers in order to secure financing. “The Exclusion Zone could resurface, 30 years after the accident, [to] become the centre of the Ukrainian energy sector,” says the ministry’s spokesperson. With the development of this colossal solar farm, Chernobyl will reclaim its place as the foundation for Ukraine’s energy supply – but this time in a safer and more environmentally-conscious form.

safe haven demand,Taking sides in the property wars,2024-09-15,2014-11-03,Andrea Murad,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20130612-taking-sides-in-the-property-wars,"The London, Hong Kong, Sydney and New York real estate markets are hot, fuelled by low interest rates and demand by foreign investors looking for safe places to park their cash — or quick returns from flipping properties in markets where prices seem to only be going up. Investors like these markets for their geography, educational institutions, lifestyle and economic activity, according to Knight Frank, a global real estate consultancy. New York and London were the top contenders in the Association of Foreign Investors in Real State’s (AFIRE) 2013 survey, with the United States and United Kingdom providing the best opportunities for capital appreciation. What’s more, the US, UK and Australian markets were ranked as having the most stable and secure real estate investments, with China ranked as one of the top emerging markets. “Global property is a safe haven” amid political and economic uncertainty, said Gráinne Gilmore, head of residential research at London-based Knight Frank. “You can touch and see your assets.” But as foreign investors pile in, owning has become an expensive proposition for local residents, even as some local governments — worried about overheated housing markets — take measures to cool prices. That presents a host of questions for people who simply want to live in the city where they work, from how long the price run-up will last to whether they should buy, rent or sell to the highest bidder. In these four cities, among others, the inventory of homes for sale has failed to keep up with demand. Local residents bid for what they can find but, especially at the high end of the market, they find themselves competing with all-cash offers from foreign investors who are more concerned about their portfolio than about living someplace. Contributing to the housing price increases had been a housing shortage fuelled in part by a slowdown in new construction in recent recessions. Housing in these cities tends to be expensive to begin with because of land costs and zoning restrictions. While construction is ramping up again, new housing won’t be completed for a few years and the new supply may have little impact on home prices overall because demand will still outstrip supply, said Adam Challis, head of residential research at Jones Lang LaSalle, a financial firm specialising in commercial real estate services and investment management based in London. In London for instance, Challis said that new building “represents less than 1% of stock and around 11% of transactions currently,” he wrote in an email. A look at what is driving prices, how governments are responding and how regular buyers and sellers should position themselves in London, Hong Kong, Sydney and New York:   Cityscapes and price controls While some countries have high taxes for foreigners purchasing real estate, others go out of their way to encourage foreign investment. Australia recently introduced changes to its capital investment requirement for residency and now, a AUS$5 million ($4.71 million) real estate purchase will fast track a visa application, said Ruth Stroppiana, chief international economist at Moody's Analytics in Sydney. “Sydney hasn’t experienced a sharp correction like other highly developed countries but it certainly stagnated after growing strongly,” said Stroppiana. The real increase in housing market activity has been above AUS$1 million ($942,200) with all-cash purchases by overseas buyers. Home prices increased 3.6% year-over-year in the first quarter of 2013, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Meanwhile, home prices in Hong Kong have doubled since 2008. “When the market’s moving, houses get flipped daily, sometimes two to three times in a day,” said Dennis Ma, local director of Greater Pearl River Delta Research at Jones Lang LaSalle in Hong Kong. To cool its market, the Hong Kong government instituted higher duties, or taxes, on properties valued at over HK$2 million ($257,610) and lower loan-to-value thresholds for mortgage lending. A special stamp duty hold, introduced in November 2010 was extended from two to three years in October 2012. There is a duty of 20% of the sale price if the seller owns the home six months or less, 15% for homes held between six and 12 months, and 10% for homes held between 12 and 36 months. To break even, home prices have to appreciate above these amounts within these periods. These measures appear to be working in Hong Kong’s luxury market. Even though taxes are surmountable by most international wealth, after introducing a 15% stamp duty on non-resident purchases, the portion of buyers from mainland China has dropped from about 30% in October 2012 to 9% in January 2013, according to Knight Frank. London has made a similar change by raising the stamp duty to 15% for properties valued above £2 million ($3.1 million) that are purchased through a company structure, a tactic that helps wealthy buyers achieve anonymity and avoid capital gains and inheritance taxes. But prices in London are on the rise. The average asking price for homes is above £500,000 ($778,600) for the first time ever, according to UK property website Rightmove. In the US, a decline in real estate prices has turned around and in cities like New York, foreign buyers are helping to drive luxury home prices well into the millions of dollars. Although no organization tracks foreign real estate investment sales in US cities, nationally, the average sale price of all homes was $212,000 in 2012, but for sales to international buyers, the average price was $400,000, according to the National Association of Realtors. “In some respects, the US is the most desired market because of the way capital can flow and the regulatory environment is more conducive to capitalism than most other countries,” said Doug Bibby, president at the National Multi Housing Council, which represents the interests of prominent US apartment firms and advocates their interest on legislative and regulatory issues.   Implications for buyers and renters In the US market, even though foreign buyers are most interested in the high end, this demand trickles down, said Michael Corbett, of Trulia, a residential real estate website. When there are 100 people willing to buy $68 million properties, “there are a thousand people buying at $3 million,” Corbett said. This drives prices up and reduces inventory in housing markets, said Corbett. “When all the $3 million homes are gone, houses that cost $2.5 million now cost $3 million.” This type of home price appreciation is good for homeowners building wealth or looking to sell, but also makes buying a challenge: houses cost more, mortgages require higher down payments and local buyers have to compete with all-cash offers. In New York, rising home prices in the city will likely push more people to move outside the five boroughs and further into the suburbs, said Andres Carbacho-Burgos, senior economist at Moody's Analytics in Philadelphia. Renting can be just as difficult. Average rents in Manhattan were $3,815 and vacancy rates were an almost non-existent 1.58% as of April 2013, according to Douglas Elliman, a real estate brokerage. Hong Kong has started to zone more land for development which could help ease supply in three to four years, but in the meantime, renting and buying are equally expensive, said Ma. With the limited supply now, selling a home while simultaneously buying is nearly impossible, he said. To scoop up a new home, a buyer might have to purchase quickly, even if his or her sale has not gone through. In Hong Kong, that means this buyer would be classified as an investor for purchasing a second home, triggering a larger down payment. What’s more, “the upside in prices is going to be limited,” Ma said.  Experts say that a correction of between 10% and 15% is possible as US interest rates begin to rise, according to Jones Lange LaSalle. Previous down-cycles have seen residential prices correct by 30% to 40%. Sydney, on the other hand, is earlier in its “green shoots” recovery, said Stroppiana of Moody’s. Despite a supply shortfall, there’s strong immigration growth, low interest rates and a tight rental market, which are both driving price increases and demand. The low interest rates have also helped make even pricier properties more affordable. Even so, experts say double-digit price increases are unlikely, making Sydney a more stable market for average buyers. “Buying a second house and renting it out is quite attractive,” Stroppiana said.

safe haven demand,The best public pools around the world,2024-09-15,2022-08-02,Dominic Lutyens,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20220729-the-best-public-swimming-pools-around-the-world,"From Bondi to Berlin and Copenhagen to Cornwall, swimming pools – particularly outdoor ones – are always in demand. Dominic Lutyens dives in and explores the pool's past, present and future. In countries as far afield as Iceland, Denmark and the UK, and in cities such as Los Angeles, Sydney, Berlin and Beijing, public swimming pools have historically been democratic palaces of leisure. In the UK, many public pools and outdoor lidos have long lain neglected; yet they are now experiencing a revival, as people increasingly rediscover the invigorating pleasures of swimming, especially outdoors. With a growing number of community groups and councils recognising the value of lidos (outdoor swimming pools) and pools to local communities, many are being restored and modernised to meet 21st-Century requirements. More like this: -          The downsides of a 'wipe-clean world' -          What the Nordics can teach us about fun -          Why the tiny house is perfect for now ""A lot of work advocating the return of the lido was done in the noughties,"" says Michael Wood, assistant professor in sport management at the department of health and life sciences, Northumbria University. ""Over the years, I started to dig deeper to understand why we had so few pools in the UK when they were so loved by the public."" The golden age of lidos in the UK was in the 1930s, when outdoor swimming became popular, and 169 were built across the country as recreational facilities. This continued into the 1940s and 50s. ""Their designs were grand, and developed a strong sense of place for the communities,"" says Wood. ""But, from the 1960s, fewer people flocked to lidos, due partly to the 1960 Wolfenden report on sport and community, which recommended that public pools be housed indoors. A 1968 Sports Council report, Planning for Sport, stressed the seasonal nature of lidos, deeming them poor value for money. By the 1960s, outdoor pools received less funding and were falling into disrepair."" Accelerating their decline, says Wood, was the increase in foreign travel.""UK lidos compared less well to countries with warmer climates that people were starting to holiday in."" But unpredictable British weather can't really be blamed for precipitating the lido's demise: ""Countries such as the Netherlands, Germany, Finland, Sweden and Iceland – with similar weather – have maintained outdoor pools and their vibrant cultures,"" says Wood. Architecturally splendid, intact interwar and postwar pools in Reykjavik, Iceland, include Sundhöll (which means swimming palace), a modernist building featuring a 25m-long pool, designed by Guðjón Samúelsson, and completed in 1937. Icelandic pools are currently celebrated in an exhibition called Bathing Culture at the Museum of Design and Applied Art in Reykjavik. By the 1960s, the exhibition shows, lidos went ludic, emphasising play over sport, with the addition of hot tubs and gigantic slides. In Los Angeles, there's the ocean-facing Annenberg Community Beach House, built in the 1920s for actress Marion Davies by her lover, William Randolph Hearst. Incorporating a heated pool that flanks Santa Monica Beach, it was restored and opened to the public in 2009. ""The State of California bought the property in 1959,"" says Jan Dyer, principal of Studio-MLA, the practice that refurbished it. ""The City of Santa Monica took over operations in the 1990s, and invited the public to reimagine its future after the 1994 Northridge earthquake damaged all its structures. Funding from the Annenberg Foundation allowed the City to realise its vision of a year-round public beach house. The original pool was intact but carefully restored, its marble tiles either cleaned or replaced, if damaged, while hand-painted decorative fish motifs on the bottom of the pool were repaired. Studio-MLA designed the children's play area and surrounding new structures, and introduced sustainable strategies to reduce light pollution and energy use."" In the UK, a renewed interest in lidos began in the 2000s with the publication of books such as Liquid Assets: The Lidos and Open Air Swimming Pools of Britain by Janet Smith, and The Lido Guide by Emma Pusill and Janet Wilkinson. ""Several old lidos are scheduled to re-open this year in the UK, such as Cleveland Pools in Bath, Britain's oldest example,"" says Wood. ""Another in Hull should follow in 2023 and we can expect to see 20-30 new public outdoor pools by 2030, bringing the number of public lidos in Britain from around 130 to 160."" Municipal pools, such as Moseley Road Baths, a handsome, Edwardian building lined with glazed brickwork in Balsall Heath, Birmingham, built in 1907, and Art Deco seawater lido Jubilee Pool in Penzance, Cornwall – so-called because it was opened in 1935 to celebrate the Silver Jubilee celebrations of King George V – were once impressive, large-scale amenities until they fell into disrepair. The former is being renovated; the latter has been fully refurbished. Moseley Road Baths, an ornate building designed by William Hale and Son, almost closed a few years ago because costs to repair it were so exorbitant. The building had once served various practical functions including laundry washing and individual bathing at a time when many homes didn't have bathrooms. Over time, condensation and air-borne chemicals had caused decay in the cast-iron arches spanning the width of its largest bathing area – the 75ft by 35ft Gala Pool. However, they have been recently renovated by conservation architects Donald Insall Associates (also responsible for restoring the Ancient Roman thermal springs and Cleveland Pools, both in Bath). ""Friends of Moseley Road Baths was set up following a public outcry over plans to close the building,"" says Matthew Vaughan, the project's lead architect. ""They formed a coalition with Historic England, World Monuments Fund and Birmingham City Council, which jointly funded the repairs."" The baths now offer activities serving the local community, including therapeutic-movement classes, yoga, language lessons, tai chi and crafts exhibitions. The baths have also been used for some time by the LGBTQ+ swimming group, Moseley Shoals. Balconies flanking the pool have been repaired: ""The Roman baths we restored also had balconies,"" says Vaughan. ""At Moseley Road Baths these would have been used to spectate swimming competitions… and supervise swimming classes later in the 20th Century."" Pointing out the origins of public bathing, he adds: ""In his Ten Books on Architecture, [Roman architect] Vitruvius wrote about public baths in Ancient Rome. The Romans constructed buildings that took advantage of natural hot springs and mastered the artificial engineering of water. Public bathing was common in Britain during the Roman occupation, for example at the baths in Bath."" A bigger splash Now the Romans' water-heating techniques are being adopted afresh in our environmentally conscious times, notably at Cornwall's Jubilee Pool, one of the largest seawater lidos in the UK: ""The drive to refurbish it was instigated in 2014 by Friends of the Jubilee Pool, a charity set up by locals, who raised £1.8m towards its renovation, with support from Cornwall Council, Penzance Council and EU funding,"" says Alex Scott-Whitby, director of Scott Whitby Studio, the architects behind the refurbishment. ""The original pool's remarkable sweeping walls break the waves, but it had suffered from being exposed to gales over 80 years,"" says Scott-Whitby. ""The Deco pool has a classic, seagull-wing shape and juts into the sea,"" says Susan Stuart, the Jubilee Pool's director. ""Old shelters on the Victorian promenade, on to which the pool was built, were utilised for kiosks, storage and a café kitchen. We wanted to keep that simplicity but desperately needed to modernise the lido and create more space. New glass buildings link the shelters in a light-touch, modern way, neither competing with nor seeking to ape the Art Deco form."" The restoration of the lido – and extension of its café and bar and addition of a community hall offering facilities such as art shows and fitness classes – are reviving its fortunes. ""Part of the pool is geothermally heated by drilling deep into the ground and extracting warm water from it,"" says Scott-Whitby. The idea for this heating method was suggested by local graphic designer Martin Nixon and his brother, Charles. ""It's the second geothermally-heated pool created in Britain; the first was the Roman one in Bath. It can be heated up to 35°C, allowing it to be used all year round. A similar pool is Blue Lagoon in Iceland. Jubilee Pool is likely to trailblaze other geothermally-heated seawater pools. Penzance is one of the [UK's] most deprived communities, and the pool is now seen as a form of regeneration, attracting more tourists to the area."" Susan Stuart adds: ""Year-round opening and renewed interest in cold-water swimming is supporting off-season growth, reducing seasonality in the local economy and bolstering employment prospects.""    The attraction of Jubilee Pool has been reinforced, says Scott-Whitby, by ""a huge interest in swimming and feeling of optimism post-pandemic"". Wood agrees: ""The pandemic made us appreciate what is local to us. Lidos also appeal because people are pushing back against our digital age and appreciating the sensual, experiential qualities of swimming."" Another early 20th-Century seawater pool still in operation is Bondi Icebergs Club in Sydney, originally called The Icebergs Swimming Club and established in 1929 by lifeguards who wanted to maintain their fitness by swimming during the winter months. At the south end of Bondi Beach, it comprises a 50m-long adults' pool and a shallow, 25m-long childrens' pool (both unheated) – it's now open all year round. Other features include hot showers, a poolside restaurant, a sauna and a museum documenting its history.  In 1999, Icelandic practice Basalt Architects masterminded Blue Lagoon, a string of geothermally-heated pools integrated into a rugged, volcanic landscape, and in 2021 Guðlaug Baths, also in Iceland, which incorporates two pools, one heated geothermally by a hot spring. Another Icelandic practice, Úti og Inni Architects, created pool complex Árbæjarlaug Árbæja in 1993. ""This features an indoor pool – with a glazed dome that draws daylight in – which connects to an outdoor pool,"" says one of its architects, Baldur Ó Svavarsson. ""It also has a slide with water gushing down it, propelling those who ride it into a deep part of the pool to ensure no one is hurt. Another attraction is its hot tubs. Many people don't swim, and like to sit in the tubs and discuss politics."" Natural springs also feed into Barton Springs Pool, a three-acre, artificial bathing pool with a limestone base built in the channel of a creek in Austin, Texas. The surrounding landscape boasts grassy slopes where swimmers can dry off after swimming or find shade in the many trees surrounding the pool. There is also an abundance of open-air pools in Copenhagen. Architects Bjarke Ingels Group designed the city's Harbour Bath, completed in 2003. Boasting pools of different depths, including a diving pool, it accommodates 600 people, and simulates a beach setting with its piers and boardwalk-like decking. Another riverside pool is Berlin's Baderschiff, located in the East Harbour of the city's River Spree. The pool is contained within the hull of an old ship – hence its name, which means bathing ship. This keeps it separate from the river water, which is too polluted to swim in. It was originally conceived as an artwork by artist Suzanne Lorenz in collaboration with architects AMP and Gil Wilk. Open from 8am to midnight, it's also a popular nightspot with a bar and DJs. One architectural practice with a strong focus on public pools is London-based Studio Octopi, whose introduction to working with communities on new outdoor swimming facilities came with the launch of Thames Baths in 2013. This proposed an experience as close as possible to swimming in a river. ""Our idea of naturally filtered river-water pools shrouded in reeds and rushes caught the imagination of the world's press and a crowdfunding campaign raised £142,000. But a site for it is yet to be found,"" says director Chris Romer-Lee. One of the studio's proposed projects is Swimmobile, the recreation of an originally US concept envisioning lorries with open-top containers driving into areas without access to water, a collaboration with artist Amy Sharrocks. ""Swimmobile gestures towards lost rivers under city streets,"" says Sharrocks. ""The idea is for it to bring a joyous splash to streets. My work is centred on collaboration and exchange, and the Swimmobile is a strong collaborative platform, an incitement to joy and deeper thinking about water. We are facing drastic water economies, but water is our great connector and supporter. The Swimmobile could host a summer season of swimming across six months each year, from May to October, or longer given the current vogue for winter swimming."" Another proposal by Studio Octopi is to restore Grange Lido in Cumbria, an Art Deco, 50m-long seawater lido that closed in 1993. A community-led group, Save Grange Lido, is on the cusp of rescuing the site as a pool. If funds can be raised, it would be heated, and a new café, restaurant and community facilities would be incorporated within existing, extended pavilions. And, thanks to a 10-year-long campaign, community group Friends of Tarlair has secured a 99-year lease on the Art Deco pavilion at Tarlair Lido in a scenic coastal spot near Aberdeen, Scotland, where there is a seawater, tidal pool. Studio Octopi has been granted consent for the full restoration of its Deco pavilion, which will house a new café with community workshops. A poorly constructed, 1970s extension has been replaced with a green stone-clad extension whose form is inspired by the pool's curves and the colour of surrounding gorse and granite-covered cliffs. The project is due to be completed in the summer of 2023. Romer-Lee has written a book on 70 of the world's finest, man-made tidal pools, called Sea Pools, to be published next year by Batsford. ""The sheer variety and staggering beauty of this pool typology is relatively under-researched,"" he says, seeing it as the start of a wider plan to build more of these pools. ""Where long tides mean troublesome swimming at low tide or where the coast is particularly dangerous due to its geology, tidal pools provide a safe haven for communities to access water. A thread that runs through all our work is the fundamental right to access water.""

safe haven demand,Why has the pound tumbled?,2024-09-15,2019-08-02,By Tom Edgington,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-49179234,"The value of the pound has fallen to a record low against the dollar. It has also fallen against the euro. It comes after the UK government announced large tax cuts, to be paid for by borrowing billions of pounds.  The pound's value affects everyone - from shoppers to business owners and investors.  This is because when the pound is worth less, the cost of goods imported from overseas goes up. For example: Even things made in the UK can cost more if parts are bought from other countries. And the pound's value has an impact when you travel abroad. If it buys less of the local currency, then things will be more expensive. Overall, the falling pound could increase the cost of living by 0.5 percentage points next year, according to Samuel Tombs of research firm Pantheon Economics. A weak pound can, however, boost businesses which export to other countries as their goods become cheaper and more attractive to foreign buyers. Investors around the world buy and sell huge amounts of foreign currency. The aim is to profit by buying a currency that goes up in value more than the one sold. The pound plummeted on Friday after the government announced huge tax cuts in its mini-budget.  It then plunged again in on Monday, reaching $1.04 - the lowest level the pound has ever been against the dollar. The cause is investors selling the pound because they have doubts about the government's plans, said Jane Foley, of Rabobank. ""They're worried that some of these tax cuts that have been announced aren't going to be fully funded,"" she said.  These same concerns have also pushed up the cost of government borrowing. The interest on 10-year bonds - which governments sell to investors - has risen from just over 1% in January, to more than 4% now. Some investors believe the government's tax cuts will lead to people spending more, which will push up prices. So in an effort to limit price rises, the Bank would raise interest rates sooner and faster.    However, raising rates could leave people with less money, as mortgages and loans become more expensive. ""The markets have decided that [Mr] Kwarteng's tax cuts will lead to higher interest rates and that a deterioration in the public finances will undermine the UK's long-term growth prospects"", said Paul Dales from Capital Economics. The Bank of England isn't set to hold its next interest rate meeting until November, but there is speculation it could act sooner.  In a statement on Twitter, the Bank said it was monitoring developments and would ""not hesitate to change interest rates by as much as needed to return inflation to the 2% target"". The dollar has also performed well against other countries' currencies. Only 24 have outperformed it since the start of the year. However, the pound has fallen more than 20% against the dollar this year, putting it among the 20 worst performing currencies. Among the currencies that have performed worse are the Argentine peso (-27%) and the Turkish lira (-29%). The euro has also fallen against the dollar, by 15% over the same period - the two currencies had the same value this year for the first time in over two decades.  The pound is down against the euro over the same period. Compared with India's rupee, the pound is down by 13% since the start of the year. The fall in the pound comes after a surge in the US dollar's value; Part of the reason is down to the US being less exposed to high energy prices caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine.  As such, the US is considered more of a safe haven for investors. Exchange rates -the rates at which currencies are bought and sold - change constantly. They are affected by lots of things, including: What is GDP and how does it affect me? Has your business been affected by the falling value of the pound?

safe haven demand,"Bitcoin peaks at new high close to $20,000",2024-09-15,2020-12-01,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-55145444,"Bitcoin has traded at its highest value to date, reaching $19,920.53 (£14,821) according to data-provider Coindesk. It took the virtual currency nearly three years to top its previous record, when it peaked about $137 lower. Bitcoin has risen in value by more than 170% since the start of the year. Analysts suggest some investors have treated it as a ""safe haven asset"" at a time of uncertainty caused by the coronavirus pandemic, but others warn that it remains volatile. Bitcoin fell below $3,300 at one point after reaching its previous high. And even this Tuesday, it briefly dipped below $18,300 a couple of hours after setting its new record. Other factors that have supported its recent rise include PayPal allowing its platform to be used to buy and sell the virtual coins in October, and a number of large institutional investors declaring interest in buying into funds tied to the crypto-currency. These include Guggenheim Partners, a Wall Street firm that announced on Friday it might put as much as $530m into a Bitcoin-related investment trust. ""It seems that barely a day goes past when we don't read a headline about a mainstream fund or company expressing an intention to put some of their holdings into Bitcoin,"" said Rhian Lewis, author of The Cryptocurrency Revolution. ""Price predictions are notorious for being wrong, so it's entirely likely there will be more dips and volatility.  ""But this time it feels very different from the 2017 high - there seems to be more real demand, and the narrative is more measured."" She added that another factor was that investors are concerned that central bank efforts to deal with Covid-19 will fuel inflation. Gold and other precious metals are traditionally used to hedge against such a risk. But because in theory only a limited amount of Bitcoin can ever be created - it was designed to only let 21 million bitcoins be produced, of which about 18.6 million already exist - some favour it as an alternative. If it does climb higher there could be sudden drops in value, however, as some traders will have set automatic sell orders pegged to it reaching the $20,000 mark. One expert warned members of the public to be careful. ""Never invest money you can't afford to lose,"" said finance and economics writer Frances Coppola. ""Bitcoin is a speculative asset and has a history of sudden crashes. It's not worth risking your house or your life savings for it. ""And borrowing to invest in Bitcoin or other crypto-currencies is a bad idea unless you are a professional trader."" Bitcoin is often referred to as a new kind of currency. But it may be best to think of its units being virtual tokens rather than physical coins or notes. However, like all currencies its value is determined by how much people are willing to exchange it for. To process Bitcoin transactions, a procedure called ""mining"" must take place, which involves a computer solving a difficult mathematical problem with a 64-digit solution. For each problem solved, one block of Bitcoins is processed. In addition the miner is rewarded with new Bitcoins. This provides an incentive for people to provide computer processing power to solve the problems. To compensate for the growing power of computer chips, the difficulty of the puzzles is adjusted to ensure a steady stream of new Bitcoins are produced each day. To receive a Bitcoin, a user must have a Bitcoin address - a string of 27-34 letters and numbers - which acts as a kind of virtual post-box to and from which the Bitcoins are sent. Since there is no register of these addresses, people can use them to protect their anonymity when making a transaction. These addresses are in turn stored in Bitcoin wallets, which are used to manage savings. They operate like privately run bank accounts - with the proviso that if the data is lost, so are the Bitcoins owned."
safe haven demand,Charities with a mountain to climb as donors drop,2024-09-15,2022-12-20,By Kevin Peachey,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-64000793,"Charities are facing ""lacklustre"" festive donations as the soaring cost of living hits the finances of organisations and their sponsors. Fewer people are donating to charity compared with before the pandemic, according to a survey by the Charities Aid Foundation (CAF). Rising prices and bills mean the money that is donated does not go as far, while demand for services is rising. One charity boss says it is leading to choices that ""make me cry"". Lara Bundock, founder and chief executive of The Snowdrop Project, which supports survivors of human trafficking, said it was no longer possible to cover the travel costs of everyone who needed her charity as a safe haven. That left some people in need questioning whether they could afford the fare to visit Snowdrop, she said. ""The economic climate and cost of living crisis has hit harder than any of us could have imagined,"" she wrote in a message to supporters. ""For the first time in 10 years, I've had to make some hard decisions to keep the charity going."" She said the charity's outgoings had increased by £10,000 a year, with a sharp increase in the cost of heating and lighting their premises in Sheffield. The charity has cut some of its English language teaching and Ms Bundock, who has climbed Kilimanjaro to fundraise for the charity, said finances were stretched but she was determined to retain experienced, key staff. ""I'm aware, of course, that everyone is struggling. I hope that if you can't donate, then they can share information with others, or companies, who maybe can,"" she told the BBC. The CAF, an advisory group for the charitable sector, said this time of year - particularly November - was usually a key month for donations owing in part to national events such as Remembrance Day. However, its survey suggested people had fewer opportunities to donate during the pandemic and the number of people donating had failed to pick up this year. That was likely to be the result of the pressure of the rising cost of living, the CAF said. Some 36% of those asked had donated in the previous four weeks, CAF's November survey showed. This was slightly higher than same month in the previous two years, but down from a 43% average during November in the pre-pandemic years.  Those who were donating were giving more than four or six years ago, but that comes at a time when high inflation is eating away at the spending power of those donations. ""People cutting back on their donations during the Christmas period is understandable but it is a concern for the many charities that rely on festive fundraising, especially following two years of cancelled charitable events and appeals,"" said Neil Heslop, chief executive of the Charities Aid Foundation. ""Charities know more than most the pressures people are feeling as they try to provide for their families during this incredibly challenging time."" The CAF said that a third of charities had seen demand for their services increase significantly compared to last year, and people were more aware of those in need in their local communities. It said people could add to the coffers of charities by declaring their donation so Gift Aid is added. There were also tax-efficient ways of giving directly from pre-tax pay or pensions. It is also urging people to volunteer their time as an equally valuable way to help."
safe haven demand,Hong Kong protest 'largest in decades',2024-09-15,2019-06-16,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-48656471,"Nearly two million people have taken part in a mass protest in Hong Kong against a controversial extradition bill, organisers say. If confirmed, it would be the largest protest in Hong Kong's history. Police said turnout was 338,000 at its peak. The masses turned out despite the suspension of the bill - which would allow extradition from Hong Kong to mainland China - on Saturday. Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam on Sunday apologised for proposing the bill. Many protesters, who fear increased Chinese influence over Hong Kong, are calling on her to resign over the unrest. They are also demanding that the bill be scrapped, not just suspended. Meanwhile, supporters of Joshua Wong - the student leader who became the face of Hong Kong's  ""Umbrella Movement"" democracy protests five years ago - say he will be released from prison later on Monday. ""Today's march we had almost two million people,"" Jimmy Sham, from the Civil Human Rights Front protest group, told reporters late on Sunday evening. The protest was mainly peaceful, with police officers reportedly holding back to allow the throngs of people to slowly pass through the city. This contrasted to scenes at the last previous major demonstration on Wednesday, which saw clashes between protesters and police that injured dozens. The demonstration began early in the afternoon in Victoria Square, with many wearing black. Many held white flowers to mourn a protester who fell to his death on Saturday from a ledge, where hours earlier he had unfurled an anti-extradition banner. The progress of the march was slow, as the large numbers of people blocked many streets and crowded train stations. As darkness fell, protesters started to take over major roads and crossings and surrounded the legislative council building. They carried placards that read ""The students did not riot"", in response to police labelling last Wednesday's student protests a riot - an offence punishable by up to 10 years in jail.  There was scepticism among some protesters about Ms Lam's decision to suspend the bill.  ""Carrie Lam has ignored the feelings of Hong Kongers,"" Mr Ma, a 67-year-old protester, told the BBC. He said Ms Lam had ""acted like it was no big deal"" after a reported million people marched last week.  ""Secondly, we are marching for the students who were brutally treated by the police. We need to get justice for them.""  Chloe Yim, 20, who had joined the protests for the first time, said: ""If Carrie sees so many people come out, and still doesn't listen - she's being an autocrat who doesn't listen to people. Hong Kong people can't accept that."" Analysis by Helier Cheung, BBC News, Hong Kong The government had hoped to reduce public anger by announcing a pause in the legislation on Saturday. That has patently failed, as even bigger numbers - close to two million, according to the organisers, took to the streets. For the chief executive, the demonstrations will have taken on a particularly personal bent, as protesters chanted ""Carrie Lam - resign!"" throughout during the day.  The government is now trying to strike a conciliatory tone - in a statement, it said it understood the protesters' views ""have been made out of love and care for Hong Kong"". It promised the chief executive would adopt a more ""sincere and humble attitude"" towards public criticism. But this is too little, too late for many protesters, who insist they won't settle for anything less than the bill being completely withdrawn. The scenes are reminiscent of 2003 - when half a million people protested against proposed national security legislation. The unpopular chief executive at the time, Tung Chee-hwa, resigned months later. But even if Ms Lam resigns, there's no guarantee that protesters will be satisfied with whoever replaces her - especially as, under Hong Kong's political system, the leader is elected by a small panel filled with allies of the Beijing government.  Hong Kong is a former British colony, but was returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a ""one country, two systems"" deal that guarantees it a level of autonomy. The government had argued the proposed extradition bill would ""plug the loopholes"" so that the city would not be a safe haven for criminals, following a murder case in Taiwan. Critics have said the legislation would expose people in Hong Kong to China's deeply flawed justice system and lead to further erosion of the city's judicial independence. Many fear the law could be used to target political opponents of the Chinese state. A large-scale march, which organisers said drew more than one million people, was held last Sunday. On Wednesday tens of thousands gathered to blockade streets around government headquarters to try to stop the second reading, or debate, of the extradition bill. There were clashes and 22 police and 60 protesters were injured. Authorities say 11 people were arrested. The police have been accused by some rights groups of excessive force.  Much of the public anger has been directed at Ms Lam, the region's elected chief executive - who is firmly supported by Beijing. Part of that anger comes from a tearful address after Wednesday's violence in which she labelled the protests ""organised riots"" – a label rejected by the hundreds of thousands of peaceful protesters. Ms Lam remained hidden from public view for days, until her announcement on Saturday the she had heard the calls for her government to ""pause and think"". But she stopped short of saying the bill would be permanently shelved.  On Sunday, she followed this up with a statement apologising for ""her government's work that has led to substantial controversies and disputes in society, causing disappointment and grief among the people"". There has been speculation among analysts about Ms Lam's future amid the continued protests, but China's foreign ministry publicly backed her on Saturday. Hong Kong was a British colony from 1841, when China ceded the island to the British after the First Opium War - which had erupted over British traders smuggling opium into China. It remained a colony until sovereignty was returned to China in 1997.  It is now part of China under a ""one country, two systems"" principle, which ensures that it keeps its own judicial independence, its own legislature and economic system. It is what China calls a special administrative region - enjoying a great deal of autonomy that has made it a key business and media hub in the region. But it remains subject to pressure from mainland China, and Beijing remains responsible for defence and foreign affairs."
safe haven demand,MP urges NHS to abandon mental hospital,2024-09-15,2017-09-05,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-41163094,"NHS England has been urged to stop commissioning beds at a private mental health hospital in South Yorkshire due to concerns over patient safety. Labour MP Louise Haigh has written to the health secretary to demand an urgent meeting about the quality of care at Cygnet Hospital Sheffield. The Care Quality Commission (CQC) has rated the hospital ""inadequate"" on safety.  Cygnet said the health and wellbeing of patients was its ""absolute priority"".  The CQC has held inspections at the site three times in 13 months, two of which were prompted by serious incidents. In its most recent inspection, held in July and focused on the Haven ward, it identified a number of issues giving it ""significant concern for the health and wellbeing of patients"". Speaking in the House of Commons in July, Ms Haigh said a young woman was found with MRSA with open wounds on a ward. The CQC also found shortfalls in patient risk assessments, reporting of incidents and safeguarding procedures. It did find hospital management had started to provide additional training to tackle ""shortfalls in adherence to patient observations"". Since raising the issue of a national shortage of mental health beds during Prime Minister's Questions, Ms Haigh has written to NHS England, Jeremy Hunt and Cygnet Healthcare over a ""lack of learning"" from incidents at the hospital.  Ms Haigh, Sheffield Heeley MP, said the recent CQC report showed the facility was ""not fit for purpose"". ""It is simply unacceptable for vulnerable patients to be treated in a facility not rated as safe,"" she said. The independent hospital, on East Bank Road, has capacity for 55 patients across four wards and provides mental health services for women, children and adolescents. In a statement, the hospital said it took CQC feedback ""very seriously"". A spokesperson said: ""We have taken immediate steps to address the areas highlighted for improvement."" A further full CQC inspection was carried out at the hospital in mid-August, with the watchdog yet to publish its findings.  An NHS England spokesperson said: ""The service provider has developed a comprehensive action plan and we, together with the CQC, are regularly reviewing this to make sure that improvements are made."""

For the chief executive, the demonstrations will have taken on a particularly personal bent, as protesters chanted ""Carrie Lam - resign!"" throughout during the day.  The government is now trying to strike a conciliatory tone - in a statement, it said it understood the protesters views ""have been made out of love and core for Hong Kong"". It promised the chief executive would adopt a more ""sincere and humble attitude"" towards public criticism. But this is too little, too late for many protesters, who insist they won't settle for anything less than the bill being completely withdrawn.   The scenes are reminiscent of 2003 - when half a million people protested against proposed national security legislation. The unpopular chief executive at the time, Tung Chee-hwa, resigned months later. But even if Ms Lam resigns, there's no guarantee that protesters will be satisfied with whoever replaces her - especially as, under Hong Kong's political system, the leader is elected by a small panel filled with allies of the Beijing government.  Hong Kong is a former British colony, but was returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a ""one country, two systems"" deal that guarantees it a level of autonomy. The government had argued the proposed extradition bill would ""plug the loopholes"" so that the city would not be a safe haven for criminals, following a murder case in Taiwan. Critics have said the legislation would expose people in Hong Kong to China's deeply flawed justice system and lead to further erosion of the city's judicial independence. Many fear the law could be used to target political opponents of the Chinese state. A large-scale march, which organisers said drew more than one million people, was held last Sunday. On Wednesday tens of thousands gathered to blockade streets around government headquarters to try to stop the second reading, or debate, of the extradition bill. There were clashes and 22 police and 60 protesters were injured. Authorities say 11 people were arrested. The police have been accused by some rights groups of excessive force.  Much of the public anger has been directed at Ms Lam, the region's elected chief executive - who is firmly supported by Beijing. Part of that anger comes from a tearful address after Wednesday's violence in which she labelled the protests ""organised riots"" – a label rejected by the hundreds of thousands of peaceful protesters. Ms Lam remained hidden from public view for days, until her announcement on Saturday the she had heard the calls for her government to ""pause and think"". But she stopped short of saying the bill would be permanently shelved.  On Sunday, she followed this up with a statement apologising for ""her government's work that has led to substantial controversies and disputes in society, causing disappointment and grief among the people"". There has been speculation among analysts about Ms Lam's future amid the continued protests, but China's foreign ministry publicly backed her on Saturday. Hong Kong was a British colony from 1841, when China ceded the island to the British after the First Opium War - which had erupted over British traders smuggling opium into China. It remained a colony until sovereignty was returned to China in 1997.  It is now part of China under a ""one country, two systems"" principle, which ensures that it keeps its own judicial independence, its own legislature and economic system. It is what China calls a special administrative region - enjoying a great deal of autonomy that has made it a key business and media hub in the region. But it remains subject to pressure from mainland China, and Beijing remains responsible for defence and foreign affairs."
safe haven demand,A new order begins under Taliban rule,2024-09-15,2021-09-08,By Lyse Doucet,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-58495112,"The phrases have tripped off the tongues of Taliban for quite some time.   ""We're working to establish an inclusive government that represents all the people of Afghanistan,"" promised Taliban leader Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar when he recently arrived in Kabul to start talks aimed at forming a leadership to move the movement from guns to government.   ""We would like to live peacefully,"" vowed Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid at the first press conference in the capital after the Taliban suddenly swept into power on 15 August. ""We don't want any internal enemies and any external enemies.""  Judge them by their actions, not their words, has become the mantra of a fast-expanding league of Taliban watchers including Afghans, foreign governments, humanitarian chiefs and political pundits the world over.  But Afghans are watching most closely of all. They have to.   On a day when brave protesters with bold banners spilled into the streets of Kabul and other cities - Afghan women leading the charge to demand their rights, their representation, their roles in society - the new Taliban government was unveiled.    Was this more evidence of the media-savvy Taliban? It temporarily knocked news of Taliban firing guns in the air, wielding rifle butts and sticks to disperse protesters, out of the world's headlines.   But it was a modest ceremony, in the mundane setting of a press conference, for such a momentous, much-anticipated message. It electrified social media, and delivered a gut punch to those who had held fast to Taliban promises.   Far from being inclusive, it is exclusively Taliban. The old organigram of the Taliban movement, with its commissions, deputies, and the all-powerful Emir Hibatullah Akhundzada, has been transplanted into a cabinet with the same political architecture of governments everywhere.  Its makeup is overwhelmingly drawn from Pashtun tribes, with only one Tajik and one Uzbek, both Talibs. There's not a single woman, not even in deputy minister positions.  The reviled Ministry of Vice and Virtue is back; the Women's Affairs Ministry is out.  It's a government of the old guard, and the new generation of mullahs and military commanders: men in charge when the Taliban ruled in the 1990s who return, beards much lighter and longer; former Guantanamo Bay prisoners; current members of US and UN black lists; battle-hardened fighters who pressed forward on every front in recent months; self-styled peacemakers who sat around negotiating tables, and shuttled around regional capitals with promises of a new Taliban 2.0.   Some names stick out - some so far they can seem provocative.  The caretaker head of cabinet is the white-bearded Mullah Hasan Akhund, a founding member of the Taliban who's on the UN's sanctions list.  The caretaker Minister of the Interior is Sirajuddin Haqqani. His face has rarely been seen except in a photograph, partially obscured by a caramel-coloured shawl, in a FBI wanted poster announcing a big bounty of $5m that's also on his head. His more recent claim to fame was an op-ed in the New York Times in 2020 calling for peace which failed to mention that the Haqqani Network named after his family is held responsible for some of the worst attacks on Afghan civilians. The Haqqanis insist there's no such network; they say they're part of the Taliban now.   The caretaker Minister of Defence, Mullah Yaqoob, represented by a black silhouette, is the eldest son of the founding Emir of the Taliban, Mullah Omar.  But, wait, this is just a caretaker cabinet.   At the press conference in Kabul, as a raucous chorus of questions rose from journalists in the room, it was said more posts might be announced in time. ""We haven't announced all the ministries and deputies yet so it's possible this list could be extended,"" Ahmadullah Wasiq, deputy head of the cultural commission, told my colleague Secunder Kermani.   This may be the opening political salvo to reward and reassure their rank and file fighters, many of whom have been streaming into Kabul, to welcome the return of a ""pure Islamic system"".    It also appears as a carefully constructed compromise. Mullah Akhund suddenly emerged at the top, fixing in place rival political and military heavyweights including Mullah Baradar whom many predicted would take a leading role, instead of a deputy position.   Taliban leaders are said to have pushed back against calls to include political leaders from the past, especially those tainted by corruption, arguing they've already had their time at the top.   A phrase still rings in my ears from Taliban negotiator Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanikzai, who's now been appointed as deputy foreign minister, the same role he held the last time round.  When I asked him in February 2020, after the signing of the landmark US-Taliban deal, what he would say to Afghans who feared their return, he replied with great gusto: ""I tell them we will have a government acceptable to the majority."" The word majority was punctuated by a loud emphasis.  In other words, a government dominated by traditional values, not what they mock as Western ideas.   Those were heady days when Afghans dared to hope the worst of the war was over. Later that year, on the first day of formal Afghan talks in the Gulf state of Qatar, a buzz shot through the room when the Taliban hinted they would no longer be demanding an Islamic Emirate; they said they understood its sensitivity.   In talks with female negotiators, they reassured them women could play every role except president, including government ministers.   That was then. This is now. The Taliban are in charge. ""Those who do not pay attention to the social fabric of Afghanistan will face serious challenges,"" warns negotiator and former MP Fawzia Koofi, who heard many of those promises.   That challenge is already crystallising in protests on the streets, in statements from capitals around the world.   ""The world is watching closely,"" warned a statement from the US State Department. ""Little chance of international recognition of Taliban soon,"" declared an editorial in Russia's Nezavisimaya Gazeta.  And a challenge may even rise from within a younger generation of Taliban.   ""We must pay attention to the lessons of history,"" a young Talib recently reflected to me. He emphasised that if the Taliban tried to dominate again, they could be toppled again, as they were in 2001, as the last government just was. Another expressed unease that mullahs schooled only in religious matters were being given so many posts.  In a statement issued soon after the caretaker cabinet was announced, the Emir noted that ""all talented and professional people"" were desperately needed for their ""talents, guidance, and work.""    But in all his exhortations, it was also clear the bottom line was about strengthening ""the system,"" the re-established Islamic Emirate. This takes precedence above all else.   In recent days in Kabul, I've asked Taliban watchers of various ilk if they thought the leadership would harden over time, or open up.   Powerful winds could tilt them in many directions.  The world's major aid agencies, who provided around 80% of the old government's budget, are watching closely. ""They're in very, very dire straits,"" the UN's humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths told me as he ended a visit where he emphasised the centrality of humanitarian principles and values, including the inclusion of women and girls. Senior officials, he remarked, asked him for patience and advice.   Afghanistan's new leaders are also under the microscope of jihadi movements worldwide who've enthusiastically welcomed a new land of Islamic governance compliant with Islamic Sharia law.   Afghanistan is, to use the expression, ""too big to fail"". Warnings about a safe haven for extremist groups, worries about human rights and a deepening humanitarian crisis of hunger and hardship, will concentrate many minds on trying to find a way to work with leaders still finding their way, still rooted in their past, rather than, as yet, a different kind of future.   But that mantra will stick - actions, not words, matter most.  In the UK you can listen to Lyse Doucet's podcast, A Wish for Afghanistan, on BBC Sounds ."
safe haven demand,"Bitcoin peaks at new high close to $20,000",2024-09-15,2020-12-01,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-55145444,"Bitcoin has traded at its highest value to date, reaching $19,920.53 (£14,821) according to data-provider Coindesk. It took the virtual currency nearly three years to top its previous record, when it peaked about $137 lower. Bitcoin has risen in value by more than 170% since the start of the year. Analysts suggest some investors have treated it as a ""safe haven asset"" at a time of uncertainty caused by the coronavirus pandemic, but others warn that it remains volatile. Bitcoin fell below $3,300 at one point after reaching its previous high. And even this Tuesday, it briefly dipped below $18,300 a couple of hours after setting its new record. Other factors that have supported its recent rise include PayPal allowing its platform to be used to buy and sell the virtual coins in October, and a number of large institutional investors declaring interest in buying into funds tied to the crypto-currency. These include Guggenheim Partners, a Wall Street firm that announced on Friday it might put as much as $530m into a Bitcoin-related investment trust. ""It seems that barely a day goes past when we don't read a headline about a mainstream fund or company expressing an intention to put some of their holdings into Bitcoin,"" said Rhian Lewis, author of The Cryptocurrency Revolution. ""Price predictions are notorious for being wrong, so it's entirely likely there will be more dips and volatility.  ""But this time it feels very different from the 2017 high - there seems to be more real demand, and the narrative is more measured."" She added that another factor was that investors are concerned that central bank efforts to deal with Covid-19 will fuel inflation. Gold and other precious metals are traditionally used to hedge against such a risk. But because in theory only a limited amount of Bitcoin can ever be created - it was designed to only let 21 million bitcoins be produced, of which about 18.6 million already exist - some favour it as an alternative. If it does climb higher there could be sudden drops in value, however, as some traders will have set automatic sell orders pegged to it reaching the $20,000 mark. One expert warned members of the public to be careful. ""Never invest money you can't afford to lose,"" said finance and economics writer Frances Coppola. ""Bitcoin is a speculative asset and has a history of sudden crashes. It's not worth risking your house or your life savings for it. ""And borrowing to invest in Bitcoin or other crypto-currencies is a bad idea unless you are a professional trader."" Bitcoin is often referred to as a new kind of currency. But it may be best to think of its units being virtual tokens rather than physical coins or notes. However, like all currencies its value is determined by how much people are willing to exchange it for. To process Bitcoin transactions, a procedure called ""mining"" must take place, which involves a computer solving a difficult mathematical problem with a 64-digit solution. For each problem solved, one block of Bitcoins is processed. In addition the miner is rewarded with new Bitcoins. This provides an incentive for people to provide computer processing power to solve the problems. To compensate for the growing power of computer chips, the difficulty of the puzzles is adjusted to ensure a steady stream of new Bitcoins are produced each day. To receive a Bitcoin, a user must have a Bitcoin address - a string of 27-34 letters and numbers - which acts as a kind of virtual post-box to and from which the Bitcoins are sent. Since there is no register of these addresses, people can use them to protect their anonymity when making a transaction. These addresses are in turn stored in Bitcoin wallets, which are used to manage savings. They operate like privately run bank accounts - with the proviso that if the data is lost, so are the Bitcoins owned."
safe haven demand,Charities with a mountain to climb as donors drop,2024-09-15,2022-12-20,By Kevin Peachey,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-64000793,"Charities are facing ""lacklustre"" festive donations as the soaring cost of living hits the finances of organisations and their sponsors. Fewer people are donating to charity compared with before the pandemic, according to a survey by the Charities Aid Foundation (CAF). Rising prices and bills mean the money that is donated does not go as far, while demand for services is rising. One charity boss says it is leading to choices that ""make me cry"". Lara Bundock, founder and chief executive of The Snowdrop Project, which supports survivors of human trafficking, said it was no longer possible to cover the travel costs of everyone who needed her charity as a safe haven. That left some people in need questioning whether they could afford the fare to visit Snowdrop, she said. ""The economic climate and cost of living crisis has hit harder than any of us could have imagined,"" she wrote in a message to supporters. ""For the first time in 10 years, I've had to make some hard decisions to keep the charity going."" She said the charity's outgoings had increased by £10,000 a year, with a sharp increase in the cost of heating and lighting their premises in Sheffield. The charity has cut some of its English language teaching and Ms Bundock, who has climbed Kilimanjaro to fundraise for the charity, said finances were stretched but she was determined to retain experienced, key staff. ""I'm aware, of course, that everyone is struggling. I hope that if you can't donate, then they can share information with others, or companies, who maybe can,"" she told the BBC. The CAF, an advisory group for the charitable sector, said this time of year - particularly November - was usually a key month for donations owing in part to national events such as Remembrance Day. However, its survey suggested people had fewer opportunities to donate during the pandemic and the number of people donating had failed to pick up this year. That was likely to be the result of the pressure of the rising cost of living, the CAF said. Some 36% of those asked had donated in the previous four weeks, CAF's November survey showed. This was slightly higher than same month in the previous two years, but down from a 43% average during November in the pre-pandemic years.  Those who were donating were giving more than four or six years ago, but that comes at a time when high inflation is eating away at the spending power of those donations. ""People cutting back on their donations during the Christmas period is understandable but it is a concern for the many charities that rely on festive fundraising, especially following two years of cancelled charitable events and appeals,"" said Neil Heslop, chief executive of the Charities Aid Foundation. ""Charities know more than most the pressures people are feeling as they try to provide for their families during this incredibly challenging time."" The CAF said that a third of charities had seen demand for their services increase significantly compared to last year, and people were more aware of those in need in their local communities. It said people could add to the coffers of charities by declaring their donation so Gift Aid is added. There were also tax-efficient ways of giving directly from pre-tax pay or pensions. It is also urging people to volunteer their time as an equally valuable way to help."
safe haven demand,US labels Switzerland a currency manipulator,2024-09-15,2020-12-16,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-55337323,"The US has labelled Switzerland and Vietnam ""currency manipulators"", accusing the countries of intervening to limit the rise of their currencies against the dollar. It said Vietnam wanted to keep the cost of its exports low, while Switzerland's designation was due in part to its response to financial turmoil from the pandemic. Switzerland rejected the label. It said it remained ""willing to intervene more strongly"" in the market. ""Foreign exchange market interventions are necessary in Switzerland's monetary policy to ensure appropriate monetary conditions and therefore price stability,"" the country added. The designations came in the US Treasury Department's semi-annual report, which examines currency practices of major US trade partners.  The US said 10 other countries also warranted monitoring, including China, Japan, South Korea and Germany. It further added Taiwan, Thailand and India to the watch list. In making a determination, the US looks at how much a country intervenes in currency markets, the size of its trade surplus with the US, as well as a broader measure of trade that includes financial flows. In the case of Switzerland, the US said the country's trade surplus with the US surged over the 12 months through June, in part due to a rush of gold exports in the first half of 2020, as American investors spooked by the pandemic bought up what is considered to be a less risky asset. Swiss efforts to offset a spike in demand for the Swiss franc, likewise considered a ""safe haven currency"", also led to intervention in currency markets amounting to 14% of the country's economic output, the US said. The intervention was ""significantly larger than in previous periods,"" it added. The Swiss have maintained that a sudden spike in the value of the franc would hurt the country's economy, expressing commitment to their practices, which include buying large amounts of US stocks. But the US said Switzerland should use ""a more balanced"" policy mix to achieve its goals. The US said Vietnam - where many firms relocated to avoid tariffs the US put on Chinese goods in 2018 and 2019  - had stepped up its intervention in foreign currency markets over the 12 months through June 2020. It said officials wanted to limit appreciation of the dong as its trade with the US increased, thereby ""gaining unfair competitive advantage in international trade"". Vietnam did not comment. The US rarely names countries currency manipulators.  When it hit China with the label last year at the urging of President Donald Trump - a determination it quickly reversed - it was the first time it had made such a determination since the early 1990s. The finding, in theory, triggers talks mediated by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). It also allows the US to limit access to certain funds, such as procurement contracts. Under Mr Trump, US trade negotiators had already raised concerns about about the issue in talks with Vietnam, raising the prospect of tariffs. It is not clear how president-elect Joe Biden will approach the issue.  In a statement, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the US would push Vietnam and Switzerland to change their practices, arguing that they threatened to hurt American businesses and workers. ""The Treasury Department has taken a strong step today to safeguard economic growth and opportunity for American workers and businesses,"" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin added.  ""Treasury will follow up on its findings with respect to Vietnam and Switzerland to work toward eliminating practices that create unfair advantages for foreign competitors."""
safe haven demand,Gold hits record high as investor jitters spread,2024-09-15,2020-07-27,By Rebecca Marston,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-53555771,"Gold hit a record high on Monday as increasing numbers of nervous investors sought a safe place to put their money.  Rising political tensions between the US and China joined the ever-present worries over the continuing coronavirus pandemic to boost the spot price to $1,944.92 an ounce,  Covid-19 cases have risen to more than 16 million globally. Many investors shun gold as it does not pay dividends or earn interest, but its price tends to rise in troubled times,  Interest rates are currently near zero and dividend returns from companies are uncertain at best, with so many struggling. So far this year, gold prices have risen 28%. As well as lacking in returns, investing in gold brings costs. Adrian Ash, director of research at precious metals trader BullionVault, says storage costs (with insurance included) are 0.12% of the size of your investment per year.  Each bar weighs 400 Troy ounces (12.5kg) and is currently worth £600,000 at today's prices, so that would cost about £60 per month. It is trading in these large bars that creates the ""spot"" price.  The bars are how the wholesale industrial and investment gold markets move metal around, and any other form of gold you buy - whether a bracelet or a coin or the microchips in your smartphone - starts out in this larger form, adding costs at every stage of manufacture. However, Mr Ash says that if you fancy visiting your haul, you cannot. ""It's hard to over-state the level of security at professional bullion vaults, and for the vast majority of people, being shown a shiny yellow brick wouldn't prove much anyway."" He says his customers can take their metal out from the vault if they wish. ""We would arrange delivery, most usually in the form of smaller bars, although that necessarily triggers the extra manufacturing and shipping costs you otherwise avoid by owning wholesale bullion inside secure storage."" Unlike shares and bonds, investors in physical gold products do not get any return on their investment. There are no dividends or interest rates and no protection against inflation. Plus you pay to store it. The value simply rises and falls on investor demand.  A fall in the value of the dollar is another factor that boosts the price of gold, which is quoted in the US currency. It means that buyers using other currencies can, in fact, be paying the same for their gold, as they are able to buy more dollars for their money. The dollar index - which measures its value against a range of currencies - has fallen to its lowest since September 2018 following increasing tensions between the US and China. China took over the premises of the US consulate in the south western city of Chengdu. The move was in retaliation for the US closing down China's diplomatic base in Houston, Texas. Later this week, the US central bank, meets to decide on monetary policy. Mihir Kapadia, head of Sun Global Investments, thinks that could also help boost the gold price further. ""With eyes on the upcoming Fed policy meeting later this week and more concerns over geopolitical tensions, further gains can be expected with these factors likely to weigh heavily on the stock markets for a few more weeks to come."" The price of fellow precious metal silver was also higher. It rose more than 6% to $24.36 per ounce, its highest since September 2013."
safe haven demand,'It's our job to keep mothers and babies safe',2024-09-15,2020-10-26,By Anna Collinson,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-54385375,"""Women may be suicidal or want to die. They may have thoughts about harming their baby. It's our job to keep them safe until they can keep themselves safe,"" says Debbie Sells. She manages a mother-and-baby unit in Nottingham which supports a small group of new mothers and pregnant women with serious psychological problems.  It's one of 19 units across England which each year treat about 800 women with perinatal mental health problems like psychosis and severe depression. Clinicians say it is important to keep mothers and babies together to protect their relationship and the infant's development.  Units stayed open during lockdown, enforcing strict Covid-control measures to protect an already vulnerable community, but demand fell. The NHS says it is vital women seek support if it's needed. BBC News has been granted rare access to the unit. Kathryn Baughan needed treatment at the Nottingham unit after the birth of her son. ""I have never experienced mental health problems before, but I started experiencing postpartum psychosis symptoms shortly after I had my baby Ollie,"" she says. ""I had hallucinations and delusions, urges to do things I would never normally want to do.  ""I relived my birth, which was really traumatic. I also thought Ollie and I didn't survive labour. It was really hard working out what was real."" Kathryn, 31, and Ollie were admitted to the Margaret Oates Mother and Baby Unit, run by Nottinghamshire Healthcare, when Ollie was just five days old.  ""Being pregnant during the pandemic caused me a lot of anxiety because of all the changing rules,"" she says.  ""I'm also a teacher and was having to try and do my job from home. It was a very confusing time."" Kathryn believes uncertainty surrounding maternity services because of coronavirus restrictions also played a role in her becoming seriously ill. ""I was in labour on my own for 13 hours because my husband Chris was not allowed on the ward."" Chris says: ""It was extremely difficult. My wife was going through this horrible ordeal and I couldn't even hold her hand. Luckily I was able to be there for the birth, but after 90 minutes I had to leave again."" Aside from a few visits, Chris missed the first weeks of his son's life. ""At the start, there were lots of concerns. ""I didn't understand the illness. You're on a steep learning curve, but soon you start to see signs of improvement. ""It was really good when Kathryn and Ollie could come home. I know it's not over, but the worst bit is and now we're just focusing on getting back to normality."" Caring for new mums during the pandemic has brought new challenges for the MBU.  Covid rules mean women have to isolate in a bedroom with just a single bed and a cot for 24 hours after they are admitted while staff wait for results of a coronavirus test. Staff nurse George Kibaja says: ""While they wait for the all clear, it can be really difficult for mums being in these four walls with their baby. It makes them not want to come to hospital."" During the initial isolation period, the only human contact patients have is with staff dressed in full personal protective equipment (PPE). One woman, who didn't want to be identified, said: ""I was already paranoid, so it was really scary the first time I saw people in masks and aprons. It's kind of like being in a sci-fi film. ""It makes you feel like you have a sickness, like if they come near me they will catch my mental health issues."" Consultant perinatal psychiatrist Dr Zena Schofield says she and her team have to work much harder to build trust, especially while wearing PPE. ""This gear definitely interferes with our ability to build therapeutic relationships with our patients, and yet it's necessary because we don't want to spread the virus around patients and staff."" And patients do not always want to have a Covid test. Dr Schofield describes how one acutely unwell young mum, detained with her new baby under the Mental Health Act, had declined a Covid test. She had to be restrained and medicated for everyone's safety. ""Our patients are often very frightened and sometimes have beliefs that people aren't who they claim to be,"" she says, Perinatal mental health problems occur during pregnancy, or in the first year following the birth of a child. Figures suggest this can affect up to 20% of expectant and new mothers, and covers a wide range of conditions including depression, anxiety disorders and postpartum psychosis. The most extreme cases can receive intensive support at an MBU, and the majority of patients are there on a voluntary basis. While England has 19 units and Scotland two, there are currently none in Wales or Northern Ireland. Care includes a range of therapies and advice on things like breastfeeding. Mums can also take part in group activities like cooking and painting. After the drop in demand during lockdown, NHS England says admissions are now close to pre-Covid-19 levels. However, some women are turning down care because of strict measures put in place to protect patients and staff from the virus. While perinatal support in the community is available, manager Debbie Sells is concerned these women may not receive enough face-to-face contact. ""Things could escalate and get to a point where they need urgent help. The majority of these illnesses are recoverable. Early intervention is really important."" A particular deal-breaker for potential patients is the dramatically reduced visiting hours. Debbie's ward in Nottingham has had to switch from a family-friendly place to only allowing one visitor per patient twice a week.  Winter will bring about further challenges.  ""Currently visitors are not allowed on the unit, just in the garden,"" Debbie says. ""This worked during the summer, but we can't expect families to sit outside in the middle of winter.  ""We are now looking at how we can safely allow visiting on the ward, but are we going to restrict that to the bedrooms? Who will deep clean that? There's so much to think about."" And some clinicians fear there may soon be an increased demand for their services due to extra pressures pregnant women are facing during the pandemic.  ""We are hearing stories of women delivering on their own and not having the support of their partner, says Debbie.  ""A traumatic birth can lead on to other things. Now not only are women becoming seriously unwell with a baby, but it's happening within a pandemic"" NHS England says while it is understandable some women and their families may have felt uneasy about seeking help in the early stages of the outbreak, it is vital they ask for support if it is needed. Support and information on mental health is available on the BBC Action Line page."
safe haven demand,Eight things that have kept us going in lockdown,2024-09-15,2020-05-09,By Lucy Rodgers,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-52578358,"Coronavirus has forced people around the world to change the way they live their lives. In Britain we have been spending most of our time at home, attempting to educate our own children and leaving the house only for essential reasons. What has kept us going? Here are eight things British people have been doing to cope with life in lockdown. With almost half of Britons (48%) reporting that their wellbeing has been affected by the coronavirus crisis, according to the UK's Office for National Statistics (ONS), large numbers of us have been forced into finding new coping strategies. Probably unsurprisingly, top of the list of things people say are helping them is staying in touch with friends and family. Almost eight in 10 respondents (78%) cite contacting important people in their lives over the phone, social media or video conferencing as a key factor in coping while being at home, according to ONS survey data collected at the end of April. And individuals have also been flocking to a variety of platforms to stay in touch. Britons are spending more time on social media, with almost half (47%) doing so, according to polling from Ipsos Mori.  And video-conferencing tool Zoom and video-chat app Houseparty have seen huge rises in take-up. Zoom says its global daily users went from around 10 million in December last year to a massive 300 million in April, while Houseparty has revealed that its app has seen 50 million sign-ups. People have also been using the internet to continue with other social activities, such as taking part in virtual worship services. More than half of respondents (52%) to the ONS survey said they had used digital services in this way. However, with many of us now relying on the internet for work, social life and entertainment, charities have warned that lockdown has left some of the UK's poorest people shut out of such support networks. According to 2017 figures from Ofcom, only 47% of those on low incomes have broadband internet at home. The Addressing Poverty with Lived Experience (Aple) Collective, a grassroots network of people with experience of living in poverty, has asked the government to introduce free wi-fi for vulnerable low-income groups. The second most popular way Britons have been coping, according to ONS data, has been by viewing on screens. Almost six in 10 people (57%) say they are watching films or using streaming services to help ease the impact of the crisis, according to the ONS. Separate research by Ipsos Mori suggests households are watching more TV overall, with an average of five hours more each week being consumed than before lockdown. The same survey also reveals families are watching more TV together, with shared viewing up by 37% year-on-year since restrictions began. ""New routines and habits are emerging, with TV bringing households together to seek comfort in shared experiences,"" says Ben Page, chief executive of Ipsos Mori. More than half of Britons (54%) say spending more time with the people in their household has helped them cope, according to the ONS. But it is not only the closeness of those we live with that is easing the effects of the lockdown, some people have also found solace in their neighbourhoods. Community spirit has also grown, ONS data suggests, with eight in 10 adults (80%) saying they think people are doing more to help others than before the pandemic began. But while for some, spending more time with family is helping them survive, for others being in a confined space for long periods of time under high levels of stress is compounding existing problems. A report by MPs on the Home Affairs Select Committee has revealed a ""surge"" in violence in the weeks after lockdown was introduced, with a rise in killings and the number of calls to the National Domestic Abuse helpline run by Refuge up 49% after three weeks. The NSPCC, which has been awarded £1.6m in government funding, has also reported a spike in demand since the crisis began, with its helpline providing almost 3,000 counselling sessions linked to the outbreak of coronavirus between late January and mid-April.  About half of us (52%) find exercising outside helps us cope under the current conditions, while almost one in three of us (31%) find indoor workouts beneficial, ONS survey data suggests. There are also indications that some people might be exercising more than before, with separate Ipsos Mori polling finding that a quarter (25%) have upped their activity levels since restrictions were imposed. The popularity of virtual classes has soared.  Body Coach Joe Wicks claimed a Guinness World Record after one of his online fitness classes was watched by nearly a million people - the most viewers for a workout live-stream on YouTube. Such exercise is not only keeping people fit though, experts say, it can help us deal with the crisis itself. ""Exercise has a dramatic anti-depressive effect,"" explains David Linden, professor of neuroscience at Johns Hopkins University. ""It blunts the brain's response to physical and emotional stress."" More than four in 10 Britons are turning to cooking, gardening or reading (45%, 42%, 44%) - or all three - to help deal with current restrictions, according to the ONS. News that many of us have turned to baking may not come as a surprise, with supermarket shelves stripped of flour since March. British grocers saw a 92% increase in purchasing of flour in the four weeks to 22 March, according to consumer research company Kantar. That's an extra 2.1 million people who bought flour in those four weeks compared with the year before. There has been a surge in demand for baking ingredients overall, Kantar's analysts say, with sales of suet up by 115% and sugar by 46% in the month to 22 April. More than 40% of the consumers polled by the company say they are doing more home-baking now than before lockdown. But along with baking ingredients, people are also craving instruction. Demand for bread recipes rose dramatically on the BBC Good Food website in April, with all the top-10-viewed videos relating to baking or bread. Nine of the highest rising recipes were also bread-related, with traffic to ""easy soda bread"" increasing 2,700% on last year. ""The motion of stirring, beating and kneading can be meditative and the results are very rewarding, which is why we are seeing a surge in people wanting to learn new baking skills,"" suggests Lily Barclay, editor of bbcgoodfood.com. As well as cooking, gardening has also proved popular, with seed companies across the UK reporting huge spikes in sales at the beginning of lockdown, with some halting new orders altogether. Since then, the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) says it has seen hundreds of thousands more people use its gardening advice pages compared with last year.  Over the past few weeks, a third of a million Britons searched for tips on how to grow potatoes, tomatoes and strawberries at home, while traffic to compost pages has increased by nearly 500% on the previous year, the RHS says. With some Britons in lockdown now having more time on their hands, almost a third (32%) are using those extra hours to do DIY tasks and more than one in 10 (14%) are learning something new, according to the ONS. The internet is awash with guides on upskilling, from home improvements, languages and instruments to dance, crafts and coding. But other platforms awarding official qualifications have also reported a surge in enrolments, such as those providing ""massive open online courses"", or Moocs, such as edX, FutureLearn and Coursera. Many, including the World Economic Forum, believe this shift away from the classroom towards educational technology, or ""edtech"", among all ages could well have changed the way we all learn and educate ourselves forever. New lockdown routines mean Britons are also changing shopping habits, placing more importance on food and cooking at home. Figures from Kantar show shoppers spent £524m more on groceries in the month to 22 April than last year - despite the fact that the number of supermarket visits fell.  The rise is primarily down to changing habits, analysts say, as people adapt to a new way of living, with people eating fewer meals out of the house.   People are also turning to their local shops to buy essentials, with convenience stores seeing an almost 40% increase in sales, Kantar says. However, not everyone is able to afford the food they and their family need. The Trussell Trust reported an 81% increase in need for emergency food parcels from food banks during the last two weeks of March compared with the same period in 2019. It was the organisation's busiest period ever. As well as taking solace in food, there also are signs people have been purchasing comfort items - in a bid to create a safe haven within our own four walls, perhaps. For example, sales of scented candles and potpourri were up 36% in the four weeks to 22 March compared with last year, figures from Kantar show. Sales of logs and firelighters were also up by 36%, Kantar says, again suggesting creating a snug home environment has become a priority for many.  Such changes in behaviour and buying habits may be why, coming to the end of our seventh week living under restrictions, there are signs many of us may not actually want to go back to our old ways at all.  YouGov polling suggests fewer than one in 10 people (9%) actually want life to return to ""normal"" after the coronavirus outbreak is over.

safe haven demand,Family helps Ukraine refugees get their own home,2024-09-15,2022-11-08,By Paul Martin,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-63543291,"When Valeriya, Emad and their two boys needed refuge from Russian missiles, the Groves family were only too pleased to provide sanctuary. But months on from fleeing the war in Ukraine, the Sloz family wanted to find a place in the UK to call their own - but that is where it got tricky. Hosts were initially asked to provide refugees a roof for six months but what happens next has left some in limbo. The only way Valeriya's family got a UK home was their hosts being a guarantor. ""I give them the name of my second family,"" said Valeriya, who has said the Groves showed them ""real love"" since they arrived from Ukraine's capital Kyiv. She, husband Emad and their two sons Milan, 12, and five-year-old Adam were told they were welcome to stay with their hosts in west Wales as long as they liked. Jane, husband Nick and 16-year-old son Tristan had shown their visitors the stunning seaside near their home in Pembrokeshire, taken them kayaking and also to the zoo. After five months, Valeriya and her family wanted their own independence and to get their own place. ""Even if you love someone very much or have family, you need to find your own way in life,"" she told BBC Wales Live. ""It doesn't mean it changes something between us but I can start my way... I need to feel the owner of my life. I like to take responsibility, all of my life I have been independent."" The Sloz family fled Kyiv at the start of the war but stayed just inside the Ukraine border in the hope Russia would stop its assault.  But as the conflict intensified, they left in early March and stayed in Germany for a month. Valeriya saw the invitation to stay with Jane's family in west Wales on the internet, so wrote to her and the rest is history. ""When we first arrived, feelings were mixed between worries and not understanding what's going on,"" recalled Valeriya. ""But thanks to Jane, I became calm and impressed with their relationship to us. They were kind, they were trying to save us from worry. ""They covered us with real love. My children had many positive emotions."" Valeriya will never forget how Jane and Nick ""protected"" her family and even though they didn't want them to leave, she knew it was better that her family try to stand on their own feet in the UK. But with a large social housing demand in Wales and the fact Ukrainian refugees do not get their housing applications expedited, families leaving their hosts face a challenge. Of the more than 130,000 Ukrainian refugees in the UK, about 30,000 have been here for six months - the period hosts were initially asked to provide shelter. The BBC has spoken to a number of host families and refugees concerned about how and when permanent accommodation could be arranged.  Many hosts on the UK government's Homes For Ukraine scheme explained how difficult it had been to find suitable housing for their guests and were worried they would not find somewhere to move. Valeriya has a job as a translator and Emad works as a chef, but finding rental accommodation was still very difficult. Without a credit rating in the UK the only way they could secure a home in Cardiff - 100 miles (160km) to the east of their host family - was by Jane and Nick acting as guarantors for their rent. Being a guarantor involves making a legal commitment to pay a tenant's rent if they cannot, so carries significant financial risk. ""For me it is means that they believe in me and gave me a chance to start my independent life in UK,"" said Valeriya. Jane said their experience highlighted that it can be ""extraordinarily difficult"" for Ukrainian refugees to find permanent accommodation. She believes the fact they could ""vouch for Valeriya 100%"" encouraged the estate agent, but the ""bottom line"" was them being able to guarantee their rent. ""I think it's going to be dreadful for all concerned,"" said Jane. ""I'm not sure why Wales suggested it wanted to be a superhost when we have insufficient housing and insufficient hosts."" Neither host families nor Welsh government-sponsored ""welcome centres"" are meant to be long-term options, but there are big waiting lists for social housing and private rentals are too expensive for many. With the war making a return home impossible for many, the future for some Ukrainians here is unclear. The UK government said more than 100,000 people arrived on the Homes for Ukraine scheme and the ""majority"" of hosts wanted to continue beyond six months. ""All arrivals have access to benefits and employment from day one and we are working with councils to ensure Ukrainians are receiving the help they need to access housing,"" a government spokesman said. ""Councils have a duty to ensure families are not left without a roof over their heads and they receive funding per person to cover any additional costs.""  About 6,000 Ukrainians have come to Wales, sponsored either by host families or the Welsh government as a ""super sponsor."" A further 2,300 visas have also been issued to Ukrainians with a sponsor in Wales. A survey by the Office for National Statistics suggested about a quarter of hosts planned to leave the scheme after six months and the Welsh government has appealed for more hosts.  The administration in Cardiff Bay said it has spent more than £500m in 2022 on social housing and housing support services.   ""We recognise the extreme pressures facing local authority housing teams, not just to accommodate people fleeing the war in Ukraine but all those in housing need,"" it added. ""We continue to work closely with them and registered social landlords to make more housing available through our £65m transitional accommodation capital programme."" The organisation that represents Wales' 22 local authorities - which are tasked with rehoming Ukrainian refugees -  said demand for social hosing was ""huge"" and no-one got special treatment. The Welsh Local Government Association leader has said Ukrainian refugees may actually be ""at a bit of a disadvantage"" because of a lack of local connections which can give people priority. ""We are looking at what the opportunities are in social housing but mainly trying to work with families around making them independent,"" said chief Andrew Morgan."
safe haven demand,Loneliness fears over Covid Christmas uncertainty,2024-09-15,2021-12-10,By Nicola Bryan,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-59580047,"People fear having their Christmas plans scuppered for a second year amid concern over the Covid variant Omicron. Wales' coronavirus rules are now being reviewed weekly instead of every three weeks in response to the new variant. The organiser of a group Christmas Day lunch to combat loneliness said those attending would be ""devastated"" if it was cancelled by new restrictions. About 50 international students in Vale of Glamorgan who are unable to travel home will stay on campus for Christmas. Wales' Health Minister Eluned Morgan has said it is too early to say if there will be festive restrictions. But the Welsh government has urged people to take lateral flow tests before going shopping, to Christmas parties or visiting others, and extended guidance on mask-wearing to pubs and restaurants, when people are not eating. Last year, plans to relax Covid rules from 23 to 27 December to allow people to meet loved ones were scrapped with just a few days' notice. Instead, only two households were allowed to meet on Christmas Day only. While there is no official guidance telling people to cancel party plans, health officials at Cardiff and Vale University Health Board have urged people not to attend parties, after huge demand at A&E departments. Almuqtada Al-Yasiri, 17, from Iraq, is one of about 50 students at Atlantic College in Vale of Glamorgan who will spend Christmas on the St Donats campus because of the pandemic.  ""My plan was to go back home for this Christmas break,"" he said. ""I really miss my family and I want to spend time with them, but the fact is because of Covid I don't want to risk it. ""If I go back, we might have a lockdown... I have exams coming so I don't want to take that risk.""  He said playing piano and the college's peers listening programme were helping keep his spirits up: ""Whenever I'm having a bad time, I just talk with them and they make my day better."" Despite the disappointment he said he was looking forward to Christmas at the college and cooking with his fellow students  Since 2012, councillor Guy Woodham has run an annual Christmas Day lunch in Milford Haven, Pembrokeshire, for about 100 people who would otherwise spend the day alone. He was forced to cancel Christmas Together for the first time last year. This year the event is going ahead but with numbers reduced to 30 and all attending must be double-vaccinated, wear masks when not seated at the table and social distance where possible.  He said he had been convinced of the need to go ahead by those who wanted to attend: ""They would actually get in touch or, if I was out and about, would speak to me and say 'please go ahead with it' and tell me their individual stories - that was the real driver. ""It was realising from having those personal conversations that for some people, it was really important to try to do it."" He said some who had attended in previous years had decided ""despite being lonely they actually would feel safer just staying at home for Christmas"". He is hoping new restrictions will not be introduced that force him to cancel: ""It would be devastating if there was an announcement that we couldn't gather on Christmas Day, but we would have to respect that. ""It would be devastating for me, for those involved, and especially those people who made it clear that they don't want to be alone on Christmas Day for very valid personal reasons. ""It's not going to be the same as it has been previously, but hopefully what we do provide will give people some enjoyment on the day, rather than fear and unhappiness of being lonely."" Ammanford Evangelical Church in Carmarthenshire has put on an annual Christmas Day lunch for those who would otherwise be alone or unable to afford a traditional Christmas for more than 20 years.  Its in-person event is off for a second Christmas and volunteers will instead be delivering meals cooked by a local pub. Pastor Sammy Davies said: ""People are definitely missing out on spending time together. ""I've actually been surprised how many people have got in touch hoping and expecting it to be in-person again his year... wanting to see each other physically again... so I think that desire is there."" He said people receiving meals would still have some ""human contact"" on Christmas Day, and volunteers had been encouraged to take time to talk on people's doorsteps.  He said people had learnt to adapt: ""I think people have become robust and are just dealing with it and grasping opportunities when they come, and being grateful even for the small things that we can do for each other too."" Kimberly Dienes, a lecturer in clinical and health psychology at Swansea University, said it was important people communicated with loved ones about how they want to spend their Christmas in light of the new variant. ""You need to sit down and really talk,"" she said. ""Don't avoid it, have those difficult discussions about what you're going to do."" She said many had found the uncertainty of the past 21 months very difficult, but focusing on acceptance could help. ""We can't predict the future… we just have to tolerate ambiguity, to accept uncertainty... focus on things that we can know and the things that we can control,"" she said.  ""What you have to do is pay attention to what makes you happy."" Performer and loneliness campaigner Carys Eleri has spent much of the pandemic living with her mother in Upper Tumble, Carmarthenshire.  She has planned a small family Christmas and drinks with friends but has come to terms with the fact that the pandemic means plans do not always work out.  ""I tried to lower my expectations and just be quite relaxed about this and think of the bigger picture - I'm safe and healthy and my family are healthy,"" she said. She said she kept her spirits up by taking up running and spending more time in the countryside through the pandemic. She said at the moment people should try not to cancel plans they have made with others. ""Especially if they are alone, they might have been really building up to see you,"" she said. ""I'm a single person, people around you have massive families and if they cancel something their life is busy anyway.  ""I might be really looking forward to that interaction, so if you do cancel something, rearrange something quite quickly - just take care of each other, be really mindful of each other's situations."" She also urged everyone to send Christmas cards this year.  ""We're used to text messages, emails, social media, sending a couple of Christmas trees emojis on Facebook... but it doesn't give any connection with that person. ""When you see the handwriting that gives so much of that person to you. ""Phone calls and Christmas cards - please do those things."""
safe haven demand,A new order begins under Taliban rule,2024-09-15,2021-09-08,By Lyse Doucet,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-58495112,"The phrases have tripped off the tongues of Taliban for quite some time.   ""We're working to establish an inclusive government that represents all the people of Afghanistan,"" promised Taliban leader Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar when he recently arrived in Kabul to start talks aimed at forming a leadership to move the movement from guns to government.   ""We would like to live peacefully,"" vowed Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid at the first press conference in the capital after the Taliban suddenly swept into power on 15 August. ""We don't want any internal enemies and any external enemies.""  Judge them by their actions, not their words, has become the mantra of a fast-expanding league of Taliban watchers including Afghans, foreign governments, humanitarian chiefs and political pundits the world over.  But Afghans are watching most closely of all. They have to.   On a day when brave protesters with bold banners spilled into the streets of Kabul and other cities - Afghan women leading the charge to demand their rights, their representation, their roles in society - the new Taliban government was unveiled.    Was this more evidence of the media-savvy Taliban? It temporarily knocked news of Taliban firing guns in the air, wielding rifle butts and sticks to disperse protesters, out of the world's headlines.   But it was a modest ceremony, in the mundane setting of a press conference, for such a momentous, much-anticipated message. It electrified social media, and delivered a gut punch to those who had held fast to Taliban promises.   Far from being inclusive, it is exclusively Taliban. The old organigram of the Taliban movement, with its commissions, deputies, and the all-powerful Emir Hibatullah Akhundzada, has been transplanted into a cabinet with the same political architecture of governments everywhere.  Its makeup is overwhelmingly drawn from Pashtun tribes, with only one Tajik and one Uzbek, both Talibs. There's not a single woman, not even in deputy minister positions.  The reviled Ministry of Vice and Virtue is back; the Women's Affairs Ministry is out.  It's a government of the old guard, and the new generation of mullahs and military commanders: men in charge when the Taliban ruled in the 1990s who return, beards much lighter and longer; former Guantanamo Bay prisoners; current members of US and UN black lists; battle-hardened fighters who pressed forward on every front in recent months; self-styled peacemakers who sat around negotiating tables, and shuttled around regional capitals with promises of a new Taliban 2.0.   Some names stick out - some so far they can seem provocative.  The caretaker head of cabinet is the white-bearded Mullah Hasan Akhund, a founding member of the Taliban who's on the UN's sanctions list.  The caretaker Minister of the Interior is Sirajuddin Haqqani. His face has rarely been seen except in a photograph, partially obscured by a caramel-coloured shawl, in a FBI wanted poster announcing a big bounty of $5m that's also on his head. His more recent claim to fame was an op-ed in the New York Times in 2020 calling for peace which failed to mention that the Haqqani Network named after his family is held responsible for some of the worst attacks on Afghan civilians. The Haqqanis insist there's no such network; they say they're part of the Taliban now.   The caretaker Minister of Defence, Mullah Yaqoob, represented by a black silhouette, is the eldest son of the founding Emir of the Taliban, Mullah Omar.  But, wait, this is just a caretaker cabinet.   At the press conference in Kabul, as a raucous chorus of questions rose from journalists in the room, it was said more posts might be announced in time. ""We haven't announced all the ministries and deputies yet so it's possible this list could be extended,"" Ahmadullah Wasiq, deputy head of the cultural commission, told my colleague Secunder Kermani.   This may be the opening political salvo to reward and reassure their rank and file fighters, many of whom have been streaming into Kabul, to welcome the return of a ""pure Islamic system"".    It also appears as a carefully constructed compromise. Mullah Akhund suddenly emerged at the top, fixing in place rival political and military heavyweights including Mullah Baradar whom many predicted would take a leading role, instead of a deputy position.   Taliban leaders are said to have pushed back against calls to include political leaders from the past, especially those tainted by corruption, arguing they've already had their time at the top.   A phrase still rings in my ears from Taliban negotiator Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanikzai, who's now been appointed as deputy foreign minister, the same role he held the last time round.  When I asked him in February 2020, after the signing of the landmark US-Taliban deal, what he would say to Afghans who feared their return, he replied with great gusto: ""I tell them we will have a government acceptable to the majority."" The word majority was punctuated by a loud emphasis.  In other words, a government dominated by traditional values, not what they mock as Western ideas.   Those were heady days when Afghans dared to hope the worst of the war was over. Later that year, on the first day of formal Afghan talks in the Gulf state of Qatar, a buzz shot through the room when the Taliban hinted they would no longer be demanding an Islamic Emirate; they said they understood its sensitivity.   In talks with female negotiators, they reassured them women could play every role except president, including government ministers.   That was then. This is now. The Taliban are in charge. ""Those who do not pay attention to the social fabric of Afghanistan will face serious challenges,"" warns negotiator and former MP Fawzia Koofi, who heard many of those promises.   That challenge is already crystallising in protests on the streets, in statements from capitals around the world.   ""The world is watching closely,"" warned a statement from the US State Department. ""Little chance of international recognition of Taliban soon,"" declared an editorial in Russia's Nezavisimaya Gazeta.  And a challenge may even rise from within a younger generation of Taliban.   ""We must pay attention to the lessons of history,"" a young Talib recently reflected to me. He emphasised that if the Taliban tried to dominate again, they could be toppled again, as they were in 2001, as the last government just was. Another expressed unease that mullahs schooled only in religious matters were being given so many posts.  In a statement issued soon after the caretaker cabinet was announced, the Emir noted that ""all talented and professional people"" were desperately needed for their ""talents, guidance, and work.""    But in all his exhortations, it was also clear the bottom line was about strengthening ""the system,"" the re-established Islamic Emirate. This takes precedence above all else.   In recent days in Kabul, I've asked Taliban watchers of various ilk if they thought the leadership would harden over time, or open up.   Powerful winds could tilt them in many directions.  The world's major aid agencies, who provided around 80% of the old government's budget, are watching closely. ""They're in very, very dire straits,"" the UN's humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths told me as he ended a visit where he emphasised the centrality of humanitarian principles and values, including the inclusion of women and girls. Senior officials, he remarked, asked him for patience and advice.   Afghanistan's new leaders are also under the microscope of jihadi movements worldwide who've enthusiastically welcomed a new land of Islamic governance compliant with Islamic Sharia law.   Afghanistan is, to use the expression, ""too big to fail"". Warnings about a safe haven for extremist groups, worries about human rights and a deepening humanitarian crisis of hunger and hardship, will concentrate many minds on trying to find a way to work with leaders still finding their way, still rooted in their past, rather than, as yet, a different kind of future.   But that mantra will stick - actions, not words, matter most.  In the UK you can listen to Lyse Doucet's podcast, A Wish for Afghanistan, on BBC Sounds ."
safe haven demand,Eight things that have kept us going in lockdown,2024-09-15,2020-05-09,By Lucy Rodgers,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-52578358,"Coronavirus has forced people around the world to change the way they live their lives. In Britain we have been spending most of our time at home, attempting to educate our own children and leaving the house only for essential reasons. What has kept us going? Here are eight things British people have been doing to cope with life in lockdown. With almost half of Britons (48%) reporting that their wellbeing has been affected by the coronavirus crisis, according to the UK's Office for National Statistics (ONS), large numbers of us have been forced into finding new coping strategies. Probably unsurprisingly, top of the list of things people say are helping them is staying in touch with friends and family. Almost eight in 10 respondents (78%) cite contacting important people in their lives over the phone, social media or video conferencing as a key factor in coping while being at home, according to ONS survey data collected at the end of April. And individuals have also been flocking to a variety of platforms to stay in touch. Britons are spending more time on social media, with almost half (47%) doing so, according to polling from Ipsos Mori.  And video-conferencing tool Zoom and video-chat app Houseparty have seen huge rises in take-up. Zoom says its global daily users went from around 10 million in December last year to a massive 300 million in April, while Houseparty has revealed that its app has seen 50 million sign-ups. People have also been using the internet to continue with other social activities, such as taking part in virtual worship services. More than half of respondents (52%) to the ONS survey said they had used digital services in this way. However, with many of us now relying on the internet for work, social life and entertainment, charities have warned that lockdown has left some of the UK's poorest people shut out of such support networks. According to 2017 figures from Ofcom, only 47% of those on low incomes have broadband internet at home. The Addressing Poverty with Lived Experience (Aple) Collective, a grassroots network of people with experience of living in poverty, has asked the government to introduce free wi-fi for vulnerable low-income groups. The second most popular way Britons have been coping, according to ONS data, has been by viewing on screens. Almost six in 10 people (57%) say they are watching films or using streaming services to help ease the impact of the crisis, according to the ONS. Separate research by Ipsos Mori suggests households are watching more TV overall, with an average of five hours more each week being consumed than before lockdown. The same survey also reveals families are watching more TV together, with shared viewing up by 37% year-on-year since restrictions began. ""New routines and habits are emerging, with TV bringing households together to seek comfort in shared experiences,"" says Ben Page, chief executive of Ipsos Mori. More than half of Britons (54%) say spending more time with the people in their household has helped them cope, according to the ONS. But it is not only the closeness of those we live with that is easing the effects of the lockdown, some people have also found solace in their neighbourhoods. Community spirit has also grown, ONS data suggests, with eight in 10 adults (80%) saying they think people are doing more to help others than before the pandemic began. But while for some, spending more time with family is helping them survive, for others being in a confined space for long periods of time under high levels of stress is compounding existing problems. A report by MPs on the Home Affairs Select Committee has revealed a ""surge"" in violence in the weeks after lockdown was introduced, with a rise in killings and the number of calls to the National Domestic Abuse helpline run by Refuge up 49% after three weeks. The NSPCC, which has been awarded £1.6m in government funding, has also reported a spike in demand since the crisis began, with its helpline providing almost 3,000 counselling sessions linked to the outbreak of coronavirus between late January and mid-April.  About half of us (52%) find exercising outside helps us cope under the current conditions, while almost one in three of us (31%) find indoor workouts beneficial, ONS survey data suggests. There are also indications that some people might be exercising more than before, with separate Ipsos Mori polling finding that a quarter (25%) have upped their activity levels since restrictions were imposed. The popularity of virtual classes has soared.  Body Coach Joe Wicks claimed a Guinness World Record after one of his online fitness classes was watched by nearly a million people - the most viewers for a workout live-stream on YouTube. Such exercise is not only keeping people fit though, experts say, it can help us deal with the crisis itself. ""Exercise has a dramatic anti-depressive effect,"" explains David Linden, professor of neuroscience at Johns Hopkins University. ""It blunts the brain's response to physical and emotional stress."" More than four in 10 Britons are turning to cooking, gardening or reading (45%, 42%, 44%) - or all three - to help deal with current restrictions, according to the ONS. News that many of us have turned to baking may not come as a surprise, with supermarket shelves stripped of flour since March. British grocers saw a 92% increase in purchasing of flour in the four weeks to 22 March, according to consumer research company Kantar. That's an extra 2.1 million people who bought flour in those four weeks compared with the year before. There has been a surge in demand for baking ingredients overall, Kantar's analysts say, with sales of suet up by 115% and sugar by 46% in the month to 22 April. More than 40% of the consumers polled by the company say they are doing more home-baking now than before lockdown. But along with baking ingredients, people are also craving instruction. Demand for bread recipes rose dramatically on the BBC Good Food website in April, with all the top-10-viewed videos relating to baking or bread. Nine of the highest rising recipes were also bread-related, with traffic to ""easy soda bread"" increasing 2,700% on last year. ""The motion of stirring, beating and kneading can be meditative and the results are very rewarding, which is why we are seeing a surge in people wanting to learn new baking skills,"" suggests Lily Barclay, editor of bbcgoodfood.com. As well as cooking, gardening has also proved popular, with seed companies across the UK reporting huge spikes in sales at the beginning of lockdown, with some halting new orders altogether. Since then, the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) says it has seen hundreds of thousands more people use its gardening advice pages compared with last year.  Over the past few weeks, a third of a million Britons searched for tips on how to grow potatoes, tomatoes and strawberries at home, while traffic to compost pages has increased by nearly 500% on the previous year, the RHS says. With some Britons in lockdown now having more time on their hands, almost a third (32%) are using those extra hours to do DIY tasks and more than one in 10 (14%) are learning something new, according to the ONS. The internet is awash with guides on upskilling, from home improvements, languages and instruments to dance, crafts and coding. But other platforms awarding official qualifications have also reported a surge in enrolments, such as those providing ""massive open online courses"", or Moocs, such as edX, FutureLearn and Coursera. Many, including the World Economic Forum, believe this shift away from the classroom towards educational technology, or ""edtech"", among all ages could well have changed the way we all learn and educate ourselves forever. New lockdown routines mean Britons are also changing shopping habits, placing more importance on food and cooking at home. Figures from Kantar show shoppers spent £524m more on groceries in the month to 22 April than last year - despite the fact that the number of supermarket visits fell.  The rise is primarily down to changing habits, analysts say, as people adapt to a new way of living, with people eating fewer meals out of the house.   People are also turning to their local shops to buy essentials, with convenience stores seeing an almost 40% increase in sales, Kantar says. However, not everyone is able to afford the food they and their family need. The Trussell Trust reported an 81% increase in need for emergency food parcels from food banks during the last two weeks of March compared with the same period in 2019. It was the organisation's busiest period ever. As well as taking solace in food, there also are signs people have been purchasing comfort items - in a bid to create a safe haven within our own four walls, perhaps. For example, sales of scented candles and potpourri were up 36% in the four weeks to 22 March compared with last year, figures from Kantar show. Sales of logs and firelighters were also up by 36%, Kantar says, again suggesting creating a snug home environment has become a priority for many.  Such changes in behaviour and buying habits may be why, coming to the end of our seventh week living under restrictions, there are signs many of us may not actually want to go back to our old ways at all.  YouGov polling suggests fewer than one in 10 people (9%) actually want life to return to ""normal"" after the coronavirus outbreak is over.

safe haven demand,Why were city flats built with no affordable homes?,2024-09-15,2023-06-09,By Ben Schofield,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-65641192,"A £40m project to build flats in the heart of the university city of Cambridge was supposed to provide ""much-needed local housing"". But the development was not required to include affordable homes and now BBC research has found at least a fifth have been sold abroad. Why? The apartments at 3&4 Station Square overlook Cambridge station, offering residents swift access to the city's rail links and historic centre. But standing in front of the two blocks, Frank Gawthrop, secretary of a local residents' association, says what happened is ""absolutely reprehensible"".  A city councillor believes they are an example of how the city's property market is ""driving and reinforcing inequality"". At least a fifth of the 89 flats were sold to overseas buyers. Some apartments have appeared on short-term rental websites. A local planning policy aims for new estates to be 40% ""affordable"", yet the £40m development was allowed to go ahead without any affordable homes. The developer says it did not break any rules or guidelines and that international purchasers paid prices in line with UK buyers. Sam Davies, an independent city councillor, says it is ""absolutely incredible"" that ""prime property in this location"" did not generate enough profit for developers to provide affordable housing. ""Property is built and bought here not as a way of addressing local need - which is of course the justification which is always provided - it is a global investment vehicle,"" she says, ""and that has a hugely distorting effect on the pricing and availability of property here."" Some real estate analysts argue, however, that expensive construction projects may not go ahead without international buyers providing finance. In 2019, Bob Weston, the chairman and chief executive of Essex-based developer Weston Homes, which built and sold the flats, said they would ""help to provide much-needed local housing"". When planning permission was granted in 2017, a report on behalf of the landowner - Brookgate - argued that if the development had to provide any affordable homes, it would not be ""viable"". Cambridge City Council's policy is 40% of new developments should be ""affordable homes"", meaning if they were let out, rents would be no more than than 60% of the city average. The council's planning committee approved the scheme with no need for affordable homes. Weston Homes says it was ""not involved in obtaining planning"" for 3&4 Station Square, while the city council says its planning process ""was consistent with approved planning practice and national planning policy requirements"". Duncan Dennis, 32, says finding a flat to rent in Cambridge is ""probably the hardest thing I've done in my life"". He and his girlfriend decided to move in together, prompting an ""exasperating"" and ""utterly exhausting"" property search. The former pub manager says they applied for 30 properties in five weeks but kept missing out. ""High demand"" properties would ""disappear within 48 hours"", he says. ""I thought running a pub through Covid was tough,"" he says.  ""I had less stress doing that than I have had in the past six weeks trying to find a house. ""It's given me a few sleepless nights recently just because you do end up worrying about all the 'what ifs': what happens if we don't find a place? What happens if we get refused for it? What if they decide to change their mind and go for someone else? What are we going to do?"" Within weeks of Weston Homes starting to advertise the one and two-bedroom apartments in February 2019, several were sold to buyers which, Land Registry documents show, were based in Hong Kong.  A design company says it produced brochures in English and Mandarin. An exhibition was organised at a five-star hotel in Hong Kong. In an article about the development, an estate agent operating in Malaysia said Cambridge had ""an incredibly robust property market"" and property in the city offered ""excellent capital appreciation and strong rental yields for property investors"". Land Registry documents show at least 17 of the 89 apartments at 3&4 Station Square were purchased by buyers who have addresses in Hong Kong or Singapore.  Another 10 appear to have been bought by property investment companies, who own the leases to five flats each. Mr Gawthrop, secretary of the South Petersfield Residents Association, says the situation is ""dreadful"" and describes a ""huge generational divide"" in the city ""caused by this sort of inward investment that is pushing up the prices beyond the reach of ordinary people"".  ""Local young people just don't get a look in,"" he says. Cambridge has among the lowest rates of property ownership outside London. The proportion of households that own their homes fell from around 49% in 2011 to 45.8% in 2021. Weston Homes says the properties were marketed ""locally, nationally and internationally"" and ""international buyers did not pay a premium"". One international buyer paid £441,600 for an apartment, while another paid £387,500. A two-bedroom flat in the development has been advertised to rent for £3,200 a month. The city council says it ""has not seen evidence that the increase in property prices in the city is caused by foreign or overseas sales of a small number of properties (relative to the total housing stock in the city)"". But Mrs Davies believes some in the city are ""beginning to question what they are getting out of the growth of the city"". Graeme Hodgson says he would have ""absolutely stayed in Cambridge"" but the 51-year-old found he and his family were priced out of the city where they had built a ""network of relationships"". ""It was a shame to move out,"" he says, but ""it was a necessity"". Mr Hodgson, a father-of-four, bought a four-bedroom home 10 miles (16km) from Cambridge in Northstowe. He and his wife both have professional jobs but could not find a suitable home to buy in the city. He says it needed ""more truly affordable homes for local people"" and that he fears his children would find it ""almost impossible to find a place they could afford in Cambridge"". A spokesperson for Weston Homes says: ""The lack of supply of rented accommodation across the country is well documented.  ""The sale of properties to purchasers who intend to rent their property out, either from the UK or overseas, is a normal part of our sales strategy across our portfolio and is not contravening any rules or guidelines."" Brookgate, which owns the freehold to the land, says it ""sold its interest to Weston Homes in 2018 who developed the buildings as its residential development partner and were responsible for all sales and marketing of the residential apartments"". Cambridge City Council says it employed ""independent viability experts"" to review Brookgate's planning application and the ""valuation exercise partially reflected the high existing use value"" of a commercial building that 3&4 Station Square replaced. It adds: ""Subsequent market conditions and costs may have changed, however, the process that the council followed was consistent with approved practice and national planning policy requirements that still apply to developments."" According to the council the wider redevelopment of land near the station has seen 325 new homes built, 121 of which are affordable.

safe haven demand,BBC 100 Women 2019: Who is on the list?,2024-09-15,2019-10-15,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-50042279,"The BBC has revealed its list of 100 inspiring and influential women from around the world for 2019.  This year 100 Women is asking: what would the future look like if it were driven by women? From climate change activist Greta Thunberg, to trans woman Nisha Ayub who was put into a male prison aged 21, many on the list are driving change on behalf of women everywhere. They give us their vision of what life could look like in 2030.  Others, such as the ""ghost"" politician defying the mafia, and the footballer battling misogyny, are using their extraordinary personal experiences to blaze a path for those who follow.  If you can't see this content, tap here The BBC's 100 Women team drew up a shortlist based on names gathered by them and suggested by the BBC's network of World Service languages teams. We were looking for candidates who had made the headlines or influenced important stories over the past 12 months, as well as those who have inspiring stories to tell, achieved something significant or influenced their societies in ways that wouldn't necessarily make the news. The pool of names was then assessed against this year's theme - the Female Future - and measured for regional representation and due impartiality, before the final 100 were chosen.

safe haven demand,'It's our job to keep mothers and babies safe',2024-09-15,2020-10-26,By Anna Collinson,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-54385375,"""Women may be suicidal or want to die. They may have thoughts about harming their baby. It's our job to keep them safe until they can keep themselves safe,"" says Debbie Sells. She manages a mother-and-baby unit in Nottingham which supports a small group of new mothers and pregnant women with serious psychological problems.  It's one of 19 units across England which each year treat about 800 women with perinatal mental health problems like psychosis and severe depression. Clinicians say it is important to keep mothers and babies together to protect their relationship and the infant's development.  Units stayed open during lockdown, enforcing strict Covid-control measures to protect an already vulnerable community, but demand fell. The NHS says it is vital women seek support if it's needed. BBC News has been granted rare access to the unit. Kathryn Baughan needed treatment at the Nottingham unit after the birth of her son. ""I have never experienced mental health problems before, but I started experiencing postpartum psychosis symptoms shortly after I had my baby Ollie,"" she says. ""I had hallucinations and delusions, urges to do things I would never normally want to do.  ""I relived my birth, which was really traumatic. I also thought Ollie and I didn't survive labour. It was really hard working out what was real."" Kathryn, 31, and Ollie were admitted to the Margaret Oates Mother and Baby Unit, run by Nottinghamshire Healthcare, when Ollie was just five days old.  ""Being pregnant during the pandemic caused me a lot of anxiety because of all the changing rules,"" she says.  ""I'm also a teacher and was having to try and do my job from home. It was a very confusing time."" Kathryn believes uncertainty surrounding maternity services because of coronavirus restrictions also played a role in her becoming seriously ill. ""I was in labour on my own for 13 hours because my husband Chris was not allowed on the ward."" Chris says: ""It was extremely difficult. My wife was going through this horrible ordeal and I couldn't even hold her hand. Luckily I was able to be there for the birth, but after 90 minutes I had to leave again."" Aside from a few visits, Chris missed the first weeks of his son's life. ""At the start, there were lots of concerns. ""I didn't understand the illness. You're on a steep learning curve, but soon you start to see signs of improvement. ""It was really good when Kathryn and Ollie could come home. I know it's not over, but the worst bit is and now we're just focusing on getting back to normality."" Caring for new mums during the pandemic has brought new challenges for the MBU.  Covid rules mean women have to isolate in a bedroom with just a single bed and a cot for 24 hours after they are admitted while staff wait for results of a coronavirus test. Staff nurse George Kibaja says: ""While they wait for the all clear, it can be really difficult for mums being in these four walls with their baby. It makes them not want to come to hospital."" During the initial isolation period, the only human contact patients have is with staff dressed in full personal protective equipment (PPE). One woman, who didn't want to be identified, said: ""I was already paranoid, so it was really scary the first time I saw people in masks and aprons. It's kind of like being in a sci-fi film. ""It makes you feel like you have a sickness, like if they come near me they will catch my mental health issues."" Consultant perinatal psychiatrist Dr Zena Schofield says she and her team have to work much harder to build trust, especially while wearing PPE. ""This gear definitely interferes with our ability to build therapeutic relationships with our patients, and yet it's necessary because we don't want to spread the virus around patients and staff."" And patients do not always want to have a Covid test. Dr Schofield describes how one acutely unwell young mum, detained with her new baby under the Mental Health Act, had declined a Covid test. She had to be restrained and medicated for everyone's safety. ""Our patients are often very frightened and sometimes have beliefs that people aren't who they claim to be,"" she says, Perinatal mental health problems occur during pregnancy, or in the first year following the birth of a child. Figures suggest this can affect up to 20% of expectant and new mothers, and covers a wide range of conditions including depression, anxiety disorders and postpartum psychosis. The most extreme cases can receive intensive support at an MBU, and the majority of patients are there on a voluntary basis. While England has 19 units and Scotland two, there are currently none in Wales or Northern Ireland. Care includes a range of therapies and advice on things like breastfeeding. Mums can also take part in group activities like cooking and painting. After the drop in demand during lockdown, NHS England says admissions are now close to pre-Covid-19 levels. However, some women are turning down care because of strict measures put in place to protect patients and staff from the virus. While perinatal support in the community is available, manager Debbie Sells is concerned these women may not receive enough face-to-face contact. ""Things could escalate and get to a point where they need urgent help. The majority of these illnesses are recoverable. Early intervention is really important."" A particular deal-breaker for potential patients is the dramatically reduced visiting hours. Debbie's ward in Nottingham has had to switch from a family-friendly place to only allowing one visitor per patient twice a week.  Winter will bring about further challenges.  ""Currently visitors are not allowed on the unit, just in the garden,"" Debbie says. ""This worked during the summer, but we can't expect families to sit outside in the middle of winter.  ""We are now looking at how we can safely allow visiting on the ward, but are we going to restrict that to the bedrooms? Who will deep clean that? There's so much to think about."" And some clinicians fear there may soon be an increased demand for their services due to extra pressures pregnant women are facing during the pandemic.  ""We are hearing stories of women delivering on their own and not having the support of their partner, says Debbie.  ""A traumatic birth can lead on to other things. Now not only are women becoming seriously unwell with a baby, but it's happening within a pandemic"" NHS England says while it is understandable some women and their families may have felt uneasy about seeking help in the early stages of the outbreak, it is vital they ask for support if it is needed. Support and information on mental health is available on the BBC Action Line page."
safe haven demand,NZ responds to pregnant reporter helped by Taliban,2024-09-15,2022-01-31,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-60150544,"New Zealand has defended its border controls after a pregnant journalist said she had to turn to the Taliban for help after not being able to fly home.  Covid-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins said there was a place for ""people with special circumstances"" like Charlotte Bellis. Her story has cast a renewed spotlight on Wellington's tough border measures designed to keep out the coronavirus.  Others took issue with her privileged relationship with the Taliban.  The Taliban has been regularly criticised for brutally clamping down on women's rights by arresting, torturing and even killing activists and campaigners.   In a column written for the New Zealand Herald newspaper, Ms Bellis said the New Zealand government had last week rejected her application to return home to give birth.  Currently, Wellington allows citizens and permanent residents to enter, but only if they spend 10 days isolating in quarantine hotels.  As there is high demand for such facilities and a limited number of spots, many New Zealanders wishing to return have effectively been shut out of their country. She compared that experience to the way she was treated by the Taliban, whom she had contacted to ask if she would be welcome in Afghanistan as an unmarried pregnant woman. Ms Bellis and her partner, a Belgian photojournalist, had been in Afghanistan last year covering the withdrawal of US troops, and it was the only place she and her partner had visas for.  ""You can come and you won't have a problem. Just tell people you're married and if it escalates, call us,"" Ms Bellis quoted the unnamed officials as saying in response to her request. ""When the Taliban offers you - a pregnant, unmarried woman - safe haven, you know your situation is messed up,"" she wrote.  Single Afghan mothers have reported being frequently harassed by Taliban officials, pressured to give up their children, and having their custodial rights threatened. Since Ms Bellis' letter was published, there have been calls for New Zealand authorities to adjust the emergency quarantine allocation criteria to specifically cater for pregnant women.  Mr Hipkins defended the policy saying the system had ""served New Zealand exceptionally well, saved lives and hospital admissions and kept our health system from being swamped."" He added however that New Zealand officials had invited Ms Bellis to apply for a visa again under a separate emergency category. Ms Bellis says she has also been offered asylum in another unnamed country since going public with her struggle.  However, her story has also come under criticism from observers, rights activists and Afghans themselves.  ""The story is just a continuation of how non-Afghans are treated differently by the Taliban ... than Afghans,"" tweeted Austrian-Afghan journalist Emran Feroz.  ""Journalists who were seen as Afghans often faced threats, beatings, torture and murder while non-Afghans ... had tons of privileges and were welcomed and treated softly by all sides,"" he added.  Most recently, there have been calls for the Taliban to release a number of women rights activists who have not been seen after their homes were raided and they were arrested."
safe haven demand,Ireland’s fearless pirate queen,2024-09-15,2016-06-20,Peter Lynch,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20160615-the-pirate-queen-of-county-mayo,"The amazing tale of Grace O'Malley, sailor, captain, plunderer, mercenary, rebel, pirate – as well as wife and mother. Sitting in a Dublin pub nursing a pint of Guinness, I got talking to a fella who told me what seemed to be an amazing and improbable story. It was about a woman from County Mayo who was a pirate and a scourge of Ireland's west coast, in the way that Black Beard had been the scourge of the Spanish Main. The time was 16th-century Ireland, when education was rare and women spent most of their life rearing children and looking after household affairs. But that was not the life of Grace O'Malley, sailor, captain, plunderer, mercenary, rebel, pirate – as well as wife and mother. A little research quickly showed that this was not just Guinness-fuelled pub ramblings, but a fascinating story that belies everything we generally take for granted about the Elizabethan era, when women rarely had a life beyond their home. I wanted to see where O'Malley lived, and hear more stories about her exploits. I was soon trundling west from Dublin on a slow train across lush and rich pasture. Ninety minutes into the journey we rattled across the river Shannon at the town of Athlone, Ireland’s geographical heart, into the province of Connaught. The landscape changed from fertile fields to wild and bleak – yet beautiful – peat bogs.   Another 90 minutes later, I arrived in the County Mayo town of Westport, staring down at the stunningly beautiful Clew Bay and the Atlantic beyond. The bay is scattered with hundreds of drowned drumlins (small low lying islands that are made of glacial debris left from the last Ice Age). The most famous of the mostly uninhabited islands is Dorninish, bought by John Lennon as a hideaway at the height of Beatlemania. My B&B was a few steps from Matt Molloy’s, the famous pub owned by the world-renowned musician with the Chieftains. In here, all the locals knew stories about Grace O'Malley, or Granuaile (pronounced Gran ya Wale) in Gaelic. The land around Clew Bay was once controlled by the powerful O'Malley family; and although Westport did not exist back then, she was born on Clare Island, a few miles west at the mouth of the bay, and her legend lives on in the area. The tales came thick and fast. Not everyone agreed on the facts, but a picture gradually emerged of her charismatic personality, her wild life and disregard for social mores. I was told that she was the leader of 200 fighting men on a small fleet of ships and would fight alongside them. Others said she would waylay passing merchant ships and demand a tax for safe passage – if they did not pay she plundered them. I was eager to know more, and someone gave me the number of a sailor named Aaron O'Grady who was also born on Clare Island and is something of a local expert on O’Malley. “He's your man,” was the general consensus. O'Grady runs fishing and diving charters in Ireland's western waters and was setting off down the coast to Kerry the next morning, calling in at his home on Clare Island on the way. I arranged to meet him at the quay at dawn. It was a blustery, wet morning, but as we set sail, the wind dropped, the rain eased and the sun eventually appeared as we cautiously manoeuvred around the multitude of small islands and sand bars. ""It's dangerous sailing for the unwary"", O'Grady said, as the 54ft yacht The Explorer yawed 40 degrees. ""That's why the bay was a safe haven for Grace; she was born in that tower house we're approaching and grew up on these waters."" Pointing north across the bay, he added, ""If you weave your way between a dozen drumlins and avoid the sandbars and rip tides, you'll come to Carrickahowley Castle, a grand hideaway that her enemies found hard to reach. She was an elusive character and had other castle hideaways on Achill Island and Lake Corrib near Galway. The O’Malley family were hereditary lords of the Mayo coast, and more than 500 years on, the tower house where she was born is still the tallest building on Clare Island. The gate to the historic monument was swinging wide open when I arrived, so I strolled in to what seemed a bleak home – but was probably considered luxurious when O'Malley was born in 1530. The upper floors have collapsed, leaving the house a hollow shell. There was a haunting presence in its ancient fabric. As a child, O'Malley probably learned to handle a currach (a slim hide-covered rowing boat), which children were still learning to row in Clew Bay. I’d been told that she was always wayward: as a young girl, having been refused permission to join her father on a sailing expedition, she cut off her hair, dressed as a boy and snuck on board his ship. O'Malley married local chieftain Donal O'Flaherty at 15 and bore three children. After her husband’s early death, she took many of his followers (he had ships and sailors for trading up and down the west coast) and returned to her ancestral home on Clare Island. Here she began sailing the seas, trading fish, fur and hides, and robbing the English when trade was slow. Nearby Galway was a major trading city and ships from England and Scotland had to pass Clew Bay en route. It was from this that the legend of Granuaile: Pirate Queen of Connacht began. I strolled west across the modest 15-sq-mile island made of hills, bogs and patches of woodland, heading for the 12th-century Cistercian Abbey where O’Malley was buried in 1603. The Abbey was much larger in its heyday, but the single remaining building is the size of an ordinary village church. Inside was an elaborate O’Malley crest depicting the family’s hunting, sailing and fighting prowess, but O'Malley’s burial chamber was nowhere to be seen. Legend has it that she may be buried in a vault behind the large family crest, but no one knows for sure. The building had the ambience of a medieval barn – rough stone, huge beams and gravel floor – but contained some remarkable, although badly damaged, wall and ceiling frescos. The frescos would once have covered the entire ceiling in a kaleidoscope of colourful human and animal figures, including dragons, cockerels, stags, a harper, birds and trees. The faded images seemed distant, like peering through a veil into the past. Back on the mainland, I made my way to Carrickahowley Castle at Rockfleet, an inlet on the north side of Clew Bay, which O’Grady had pointed out to me. After marrying, her second husband, Richard Bourke in 1566, this became O'Malley’s main home, and its big attraction was its inaccessibility and stout defences. Stories say that after just one year of marriage she evoked an ancient Celtic law by putting her husband’s property outside and greeting him on his return home by shouting from the ramparts, ""Richard Bourke I dismiss you!"" They later reconciled and remained together until his death 17 years later. When Bourke died in 1583, O'Malley’s clashes with the English intensified, and her son Tibbot was captured. That September, she sailed to England, up the River Thames to Greenwich Palace, and met Queen Elizabeth I, where she negotiated Tibbot's release and her own pardon by agreeing to fight the Queen's enemies. In the 1603 battle of Kinsale, Tibbot and other Mayo chiefs fought with the Queen of England's forces, helping to defeat the Spanish and their Irish rebel allies. This was probably one of the reasons O'Malley was disowned by Irish historians; the other was her unladylike behaviour of flouting every conceivable law, tradition and social custom of the times. Since O'Malley was written out of official Irish history, very little written information exists. Irish historians were usually religious monks, and being a woman, she was ignored. But there’s always an alternative history to accepted traditional texts, and stories and legends about her exploits are widespread in Mayo.

safe haven demand,Oil price above $80 for first time in three years,2024-09-15,2021-09-28,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-58727437,"Oil prices climbed above $80 (£59) a barrel on Tuesday, hitting their highest level in three years as the pound slumped. Brent crude, the international benchmark, rose to as much as $80.69 on the day, the most since October 2018. Prices have been rising for seven consecutive days on the back of the energy crisis in Europe. Analysts believe that oil prices will continue to rise amid surging demand and tight supplies. Investment bank Goldman Sachs said Brent could hit $90 per barrel by the end of the year, warning that rising input costs, higher gas prices and weaker growth were likely to weigh on European corporate profit growth for 2021.  ""When growth slows, it becomes harder for companies to pass on higher input costs, which is the main risk for net income margins,"" the Wall Street lender said. It came as the pound suffered its biggest one-day drop against the dollar on Tuesday, tumbling 1.3% to just under $1.3530 amid inflation fears. It was its lowest since January, as investors sought safe haven in the dollar. Share markets also headed lower, with European indexes in the red, and stocks on Wall Street likewise falling. Jordan Rochester, currency analyst at Nomura, said: ""Rising inflation concerns are making sterling-denominated assets less attractive.""  Brent crude on the other hand has already gained about 55% for the year to date. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) also rose to around $75 a barrel. Oil prices slumped at the start of the pandemic. In April last year, they fell below zero for the first time in history as lockdown wiped out demand while producers continued to pump crude from their wells. However, demand has been rising in recent months as economies around the world have started to reopen. Global oil supplies have also taken a hit from hurricanes Ida and Nicholas passing through the Gulf of Mexico and damaging US oil infrastructure. A dramatic surge in natural gas prices has also made oil a relatively cheaper alternative for power generation, which in turn has increased demand.  The world's biggest independent oil trader, the Vitol Group, said it expected global demand for crude to increase by 500,000 barrels a day this winter. ""Similarly, India, the second-biggest importer of crude oil, has also ramped up its oil imports to a three-month high in August, as refiners begin to stock up as they project higher demand going forward,"" said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets. Oil exporters group Opec has also said there will be a surge in demand, but expects this to be slightly lower, at about 370,000 extra barrels a day. During the pandemic, several members of the Opec+ group of producers, which includes ally Russia and several other countries, cut output and have since been having trouble ramping up to meet recovering demand.  In the UK, motorists are struggling with fuel prices hitting an eight-year high, said the RAC, sparked by goods vehicle driver shortages in the country. Petrol prices reached 135.3p a litre, while the average cost of diesel now stands at 136.9p. The price of oil is directly linked to the cost of wholesale fuel, as crude is used in the production of petrol and diesel.  Simon Williams, RAC fuel spokesman, said the picture was ""pretty bleak"" for drivers. ""With the cost of oil rising and now near a three-year high, wholesale prices are being forced up, which means retailers are paying more than they were just a few days ago for the same amount of fuel,"" he said. ""We might yet see higher forecourt prices in the coming days, irrespective of the current supply problems."""
safe haven demand,Gold hits record high as investor jitters spread,2024-09-15,2020-07-27,By Rebecca Marston,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-53555771,"Gold hit a record high on Monday as increasing numbers of nervous investors sought a safe place to put their money.  Rising political tensions between the US and China joined the ever-present worries over the continuing coronavirus pandemic to boost the spot price to $1,944.92 an ounce,  Covid-19 cases have risen to more than 16 million globally. Many investors shun gold as it does not pay dividends or earn interest, but its price tends to rise in troubled times,  Interest rates are currently near zero and dividend returns from companies are uncertain at best, with so many struggling. So far this year, gold prices have risen 28%. As well as lacking in returns, investing in gold brings costs. Adrian Ash, director of research at precious metals trader BullionVault, says storage costs (with insurance included) are 0.12% of the size of your investment per year.  Each bar weighs 400 Troy ounces (12.5kg) and is currently worth £600,000 at today's prices, so that would cost about £60 per month. It is trading in these large bars that creates the ""spot"" price.  The bars are how the wholesale industrial and investment gold markets move metal around, and any other form of gold you buy - whether a bracelet or a coin or the microchips in your smartphone - starts out in this larger form, adding costs at every stage of manufacture. However, Mr Ash says that if you fancy visiting your haul, you cannot. ""It's hard to over-state the level of security at professional bullion vaults, and for the vast majority of people, being shown a shiny yellow brick wouldn't prove much anyway."" He says his customers can take their metal out from the vault if they wish. ""We would arrange delivery, most usually in the form of smaller bars, although that necessarily triggers the extra manufacturing and shipping costs you otherwise avoid by owning wholesale bullion inside secure storage."" Unlike shares and bonds, investors in physical gold products do not get any return on their investment. There are no dividends or interest rates and no protection against inflation. Plus you pay to store it. The value simply rises and falls on investor demand.  A fall in the value of the dollar is another factor that boosts the price of gold, which is quoted in the US currency. It means that buyers using other currencies can, in fact, be paying the same for their gold, as they are able to buy more dollars for their money. The dollar index - which measures its value against a range of currencies - has fallen to its lowest since September 2018 following increasing tensions between the US and China. China took over the premises of the US consulate in the south western city of Chengdu. The move was in retaliation for the US closing down China's diplomatic base in Houston, Texas. Later this week, the US central bank, meets to decide on monetary policy. Mihir Kapadia, head of Sun Global Investments, thinks that could also help boost the gold price further. ""With eyes on the upcoming Fed policy meeting later this week and more concerns over geopolitical tensions, further gains can be expected with these factors likely to weigh heavily on the stock markets for a few more weeks to come."" The price of fellow precious metal silver was also higher. It rose more than 6% to $24.36 per ounce, its highest since September 2013."
safe haven demand,Centre calls for more homes for Ukrainian refugees,2024-09-15,2023-01-17,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-coventry-warwickshire-64301227,"A refugee centre has called for more sponsors to come forward to help people fleeing the Ukraine war.  Coventry Refugee and Migrant Centre (CRMC) said there was a ""really high"" demand for accommodation from Ukrainians, as well as other refugees. Its staff and the city council would advise and support those who joined the Homes for Ukraine scheme.  Caroline Higgins, of the charity, said they particularly needed larger accommodation for families.  The CRMC, in Bird Street, will give information about becoming a host at an event on Saturday.  Ms Higgins, its head of operations, said families could be more difficult to accommodate as they needed more than one room.  ""The need is really, really high for people from Ukraine and other countries as well. So the work that we do is really important,"" she said.   ""It's often challenging because there are lots of obstacles in the way for people."" But she said they had helped a lot of people and provided ongoing support so they were ""able to rebuild their lives in this country"". Single people, particularly women, were among those needing sponsors.  ""There are some men as well who are exempt from the military service for various health-related reasons,"" she added.  In November, the local authority said 248 Ukrainians had come to the city under the Homes for Ukraine scheme and it expected about 50 more in December.  The situation in Ukraine was ""driving more people to search for a place of safety in Coventry"", it said.  ""Coventry residents continue to offer to open up their homes in good numbers and Coventry Refugee and Migrant Centre are doing an amazing job to match desperate Ukrainians to the offers of help,"" it said.  Ukrainian refugees put on a concert in November to thank people in the city for giving them a safe haven.  Louise Fellows, of Warwick, who had a mother and son stay at her home for six months, said their own experience was good and encouraged others to join the scheme.  She said her son and the Ukrainian boy ""literally became like brothers"" and enjoyed trips to the park, museums and paddle-boarding together.  Mrs Fellows advised people to find out about the people who would stay with them and imagine how life would work together.  Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

safe haven demand,What is happening to the Japanese yen?,2024-09-15,2022-10-27,By Mariko Oi,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63335371,"At the end of the last century, Japan became the first major economy to cut interest rates to zero.  During the Covid pandemic, many other nations adopted that tactic to support their economies.  Those countries are now raising interest rates but the Bank of Japan (BOJ) on Friday yet again kept its main rate below zero. And that is bad for its currency.  The yen has long been seen as a safe haven, which investors traditionally bought at times of crisis. But that status is now on shaky ground. This year alone it has lost more than a fifth of its value against the US dollar to hit the lowest level since 1990. The yen's slide has been driven by the difference between interest rates in Japan and the US. Since March, the US Federal Reserve has aggressively raised its main interest rate - from 0.25% to 3.25% - as it tries to tackle the rising cost of living. Higher interest rates tend to make a currency more attractive to investors. As a result there is less demand for currencies from countries with lower rates and those currencies fall in value. However, some experts believe the weak yen reflects the state of the country's finances. The economy has hardly grown in the last three decades. It is also the world's most indebted nation. Japan also faced the demographic time bomb of a low birth rate and a population with the highest proportion of older people in the world. The government has allowed some foreign workers to help address the issue but there is still strong opposition to immigration. ""There is no reason for the yen to strengthen,"" says Takeshi Fujimaki, a former adviser to billionaire investor George Soros. He expects the Japanese currency to hit 180 against the US dollar before eventually collapsing in value, as he has previously warned. BOJ governor, Haruhiko Kuroda, has repeatedly said the economy is too weak to handle higher interest rates. Like much of the rest of the world, Japanese consumers are struggling with rising inflation but that has been welcomed by policy makers, who have long wanted prices to rise. Mr Kuroda says the bank's current policy is necessary to help it reach its 2% inflation target. That is because for years Japan has faced deflation, or falling prices, which is bad for an economy because when prices keep dropping, consumers tend to hold back on buying big ticket items as they expect them to be cheaper in the future. Japan had not intervened in the global currency market to prop up the yen for almost two and a half decades. Last month though, as the currency fell, authorities stepped in, spending $21bn (£18.3bn). It helped for a short time but soon the currency tumbled again, this time crossing 150 yen to the dollar. That reportedly triggered fresh intervention, this time with an estimated $37bn. The Japanese government has so far refused to confirm it stepped in again, even as traders said they saw signs of another intervention earlier this week. Experts have warned that these attempts to prop up the yen will only ever have a short term effect. ""It is to show the position of the Japanese government that it doesn't want any further weakening of Japanese yen,"" Eisuke Sakakibara, a former senior official at Japan's finance ministry said. The weak yen makes everything Japan buys more expensive. The country relies heavily on imported oil and gas. Because of exchange rates and rising energy prices, the amount of money it spent on imports last month jumped by 46%. But it is not all bad news for businesses. The money made abroad by Japanese exporters is worth a lot more back home. As exports account for about 15% of the country's total economic activity, that is not insignificant. However, Japan's consumers have seen their purchasing power halved over the last decade. Ten years ago, 10,000 yen would buy an item worth $132, but today it only gets you something worth $67. That is a major problem because average salaries in Japan have hardly risen in over three decades. The issue is even more acute when people need to use the yen to pay for things overseas, for example when they travel or their children study abroad. When the yen started to fall in value Japan's borders were still shut so people did not feel much of an effect. However, now that Japan has started to allow visitors in the currency's sliding value makes the country more attractive to tourists, as their holiday money goes further. In 2019, Japan welcomed 32 million foreign visitors, who spent about 5 trillion yen ($33.6bn; £29.7bn). While tourist numbers are still a long way from that level, investment bank Goldman Sachs has predicted inbound spending could reach 6.6tn yen within a year of the country fully reopening."
safe haven demand,Gold hits record as bets on interest rates shift,2024-09-15,2023-12-04,By Natalie Sherman,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-67617540,"Gold prices have hit a new high, while the value of Bitcoin has also surged. The gains come as traders switch investing strategies, after nearly two years when rising interest rates helped fuel demand for US dollars and certain kinds of debt. Investors now see a rising chance of rate cuts, which has reignited interest in other assets. As Asian markets started trading on Monday, the price of gold jumped above $2,000, up 3%, before retreating.  Demand for dollars ticked up again later in the trading session on Monday, helping to push gold into retreat. Many investors holding gold were also taking advantage of the recent highs to sell, analysts said. The gains have followed a weeks-long climb for the metal, which is seen as a ""safe haven"" and saw demand rise after the start of the Israel-Gaza war.  The latest rally was sparked by comments on Friday by the head of the US central bank, Jerome Powell. The Federal Reserve upended financial markets last year as concerns about soaring inflation prompted it - and central banks around the world - to abruptly push interest rates to the highest levels in more than two decades to try to stabilise prices.  The moves forced many investors to re-think strategies, as investments considered less risky started to pay more. But in a speech on Friday, Mr Powell said the Federal Reserve's policy was now ""well into restrictive territory"" - meaning that rates were now high enough to cool the economy and stabilise prices, without any immediate need for further hikes. Indeed, traders increasingly expect the bank to actually cut rates starting as soon as March 2024, though Mr Powell has sought to dampen those expectations.  ""If signs of low interest rates become more evident, gold should continue to soar next year,"" Alexander Zumpfe, a precious metals trader at Heraeus, told Reuters. Financial markets in the US generally have rallied in recent months, as analysts grow more optimistic that the bank will be able to tame inflation without a significant hit to the American economy. The price of Bitcoin also continues to recover after higher rates and a series of scandals in 2022 helped spark a plunge.  The most well-known digital asset momentarily surged past $42,000 - its highest level since April 2022. Its price has more than doubled since the start of the year.  Bitcoin is also hoping investors will start to move on, after US regulators have taken action against the heads of two of the biggest crypto trading firms, FTX and Binance. US regulators are expected to approve new kinds of trading products linked to Bitcoin as early as next month."
safe haven demand,The gold mine beneath London's streets,2024-09-15,2016-04-19,Pádraig Belton,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20160419-the-city-with-248-billion-beneath-its-pavement,"Under London’s streets lies a hidden gold mine. It stretches across more than 300,000 square feet under the City, the finance quarter in the heart of Britain’s capital. There, beneath the pavement and commuters of Threadneedle Street, lies a maze of eight Bank of England gold vaults – each stacked with gold bars worth a total sum of around £141 billion ($200 billion). The bars sit on rows of blue numbered shelves. Every bar weighs precisely 400 troy ounces (about 12kg), making each currently worth some £350,000 ($500,000), comfortably more than the average price of a house in the UK. Each bar looks subtly different depending on where it was refined. Some bars have sloping edges to make them easier to pick up; others look more like a loaf of bread. There is no smell here: metal has none. There is no noise, either, on account of the vaults’ thick concrete walls. What there is, however, is one of the world’s most important traded assets. Deals are still done in gold in almost every country in the world. Its price is a crucial barometer for consumer confidence. Prices rise when markets are uncertain, and before US elections – like now. “Gold is a hedge against uncertainty,” says Jonathan Spall, a long-time gold trader and now managing director of G Cubed Metal. These vaults lie right at the heart of this volatile, incredibly important market. About one-fifth of all the gold held by the world’s governments is in London. In total, 6,256 tonnes of gold are stored in vaults in and around London – collectively worth about £172 billion ($248 billion). The Bank of England vaults alone hold 5,134 tonnes, including the official reserves of the UK Treasury and the vast majority of the physical gold traded in London. Gold owned by 30 other countries is also in these vaults along with the hoards of about 25 banks. So much gold is kept in Britain’s capital partly to keep it near where the metal is traded. It’s also a reflection of the security of London’s vaults. Hiding your stash The Bank of England vaults were built in the 1930s. During World War II, when Britain’s bullion was secretly moved to Canada to continue the war effort if Britain was overrun, one vault was used as a staff canteen for Bank of England employees. Vintage advertisements for the P&O cruise line, enticing Bank employees away to holiday, are still plastered across the walls. Later, in the 1940s, the vault was used as a bomb shelter. But since 1945, the vaults have been used primarily for gold. Storing your assets in a huge safe might seem more fitting for a Tudor monarchy than a modern central bank. But the Bank of England still uses not only vaults, but several 3ft-long keys for access. Insiders believe that electronic access alone could be more prone to abuse. (You do still have to speak a password into a microphone and a computer matches your voice against a saved sample). The bars arrive in London by surprisingly traditional methods, too. Some come by sea, shipped from refineries like PAMP in Switzerland or Rand Refinery outside Johannesburg in South Africa. Gold is also moved on regular passenger aeroplanes. “In the cargo hold of commercial passenger planes, you often find gold, fresh flowers, and dead bodies,” says Ruth Crowell, chief executive of the London Bullion Market Association. But more difficult than finding transport can be finding a place to house it. Because much of the City of London is on clay ground and because gold is such a dense substance, you can only stack the bars so high before the vault starts sinking into the clay, Crowell says. (The weight of a City skyscraper is spread over a larger footprint, which makes that risk less likely). This is less of a problem in other cities. In Manhattan, which sits on bedrock, the Federal Reserve Bank can stack bars from floor to ceiling. As a result, there are restrictions on how much gold can be stacked in the Bank’s vaults. On the top level, the gold bars can only be stacked four pallets high. On the lower, they can only be stacked up to six. This means London needs to spread out its gold more to stop it sinking, and needs more vaults of smaller sizes. As a result, it isn’t just the City’s streets that are paved with gold. There are seven smaller vaults inside the M25 (the motorway that encircles Greater London) owned by banks like JP Morgan and HSBC, including three at transport companies around Heathrow Airport. Each owner attempts to keep their vault’s location secret. When CNBC journalists visited JP Morgan in 2011, for example, they had to surrender their mobile phones and travel in a car with blacked-out windows. Getting your gold fix It isn’t just vault locations that are kept under wraps. The gold market itself is secretive and steeped in tradition and ritual, particularly around the fixing system used for setting the price. The price setting meetings or “fixes” – in which there are now 12 direct participants hailing from the UK, US, Canada, China and France – take place twice a day. When a price matches supply and demand, the price is fixed. Until 2015, this was done verbally: a chairman would try different prices on the participants, each of whom would say if, at that price, they would be buyers or sellers. From 1919 until 2004 fixes were done in person in the City of London. Originally, if a participant wished to pause proceedings – to change between buying and selling, for example – he would raise a small UK flag. In 2004, the fixes were moved to a conference call. Only last year did the system change to a more modern electronic auction platform run by the Intercontinental Exchange, which also owns the New York Stock Exchange. “If everyone knows there are two key points in the day to show up, you get the best liquidity balance between buying and selling,” says Matthew Glenville, chief operating officer of the Intercontinental Exchange Benchmark Administration. This ‘spot’ price is then used as a benchmark for people buying and selling gold around the world, a market where transactions total around £85 billion ($120 billion) a day. Portable assets During good times, gold is less in demand. But when the economy is tough, the metal is highly prized as a safe haven asset – not quite like storing cash under the mattress, but still a way to hedge against risk in other markets. As a result, gold increases in value when markets are volatile. Since the 1,000-point Dow Jones plunge of August 2015, the average price of the morning fix has increased each month, rising from £705 ($1,000) in December to £870 ($1,250) in March. When stock markets slump, governments and private investors ditch equities and buy gold – like Russia and China are doing now. Even so, only 32% of the world’s yellow metal is actually held by governments, banks and investors under lock and key. About 12% is used industrially, such as in electronics circuits. And more than half is used for jewellery. China and India are particularly significant markets for jewellery, together accounting for half of world demand. In India alone, an average of 30 to 40 grams of gold are purchased for each of the country’s 10 million weddings each year. “China and India, between the two of them, accounted for less than 10% of global demand in 2000,” says Ross Norman, chief executive of the bullion dealer Sharps Pixley. “Now it’s north of 90%.” With the current volatility of major currencies and stock markets, it’s little surprise that gold has returned to fashion. One sign? The opening of London’s first high street gold showroom in January. Sharps Pixley is located directly across from the private clubs White’s and Boodle’s in the heart of the upmarket St James’s neighbourhood. The building, which is owned by The Apprentice star Lord Sugar, has an exclusive and club-like interior with dark timber, brass and a large chandelier. If you want to get your hands on some bullion today, Sharps Pixley sells gold over the counter, in bars ranging from a kilogram (£28,058) down to one gram (£33.89). But with prices on the increase, you’d best bring your gold card. This story is a part of BBC Britain – a series focused on exploring this extraordinary island, one story at a time.

safe haven demand,Family helps Ukraine refugees get their own home,2024-09-15,2022-11-08,By Paul Martin,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-63543291,"When Valeriya, Emad and their two boys needed refuge from Russian missiles, the Groves family were only too pleased to provide sanctuary. But months on from fleeing the war in Ukraine, the Sloz family wanted to find a place in the UK to call their own - but that is where it got tricky. Hosts were initially asked to provide refugees a roof for six months but what happens next has left some in limbo. The only way Valeriya's family got a UK home was their hosts being a guarantor. ""I give them the name of my second family,"" said Valeriya, who has said the Groves showed them ""real love"" since they arrived from Ukraine's capital Kyiv. She, husband Emad and their two sons Milan, 12, and five-year-old Adam were told they were welcome to stay with their hosts in west Wales as long as they liked. Jane, husband Nick and 16-year-old son Tristan had shown their visitors the stunning seaside near their home in Pembrokeshire, taken them kayaking and also to the zoo. After five months, Valeriya and her family wanted their own independence and to get their own place. ""Even if you love someone very much or have family, you need to find your own way in life,"" she told BBC Wales Live. ""It doesn't mean it changes something between us but I can start my way... I need to feel the owner of my life. I like to take responsibility, all of my life I have been independent."" The Sloz family fled Kyiv at the start of the war but stayed just inside the Ukraine border in the hope Russia would stop its assault.  But as the conflict intensified, they left in early March and stayed in Germany for a month. Valeriya saw the invitation to stay with Jane's family in west Wales on the internet, so wrote to her and the rest is history. ""When we first arrived, feelings were mixed between worries and not understanding what's going on,"" recalled Valeriya. ""But thanks to Jane, I became calm and impressed with their relationship to us. They were kind, they were trying to save us from worry. ""They covered us with real love. My children had many positive emotions."" Valeriya will never forget how Jane and Nick ""protected"" her family and even though they didn't want them to leave, she knew it was better that her family try to stand on their own feet in the UK. But with a large social housing demand in Wales and the fact Ukrainian refugees do not get their housing applications expedited, families leaving their hosts face a challenge. Of the more than 130,000 Ukrainian refugees in the UK, about 30,000 have been here for six months - the period hosts were initially asked to provide shelter. The BBC has spoken to a number of host families and refugees concerned about how and when permanent accommodation could be arranged.  Many hosts on the UK government's Homes For Ukraine scheme explained how difficult it had been to find suitable housing for their guests and were worried they would not find somewhere to move. Valeriya has a job as a translator and Emad works as a chef, but finding rental accommodation was still very difficult. Without a credit rating in the UK the only way they could secure a home in Cardiff - 100 miles (160km) to the east of their host family - was by Jane and Nick acting as guarantors for their rent. Being a guarantor involves making a legal commitment to pay a tenant's rent if they cannot, so carries significant financial risk. ""For me it is means that they believe in me and gave me a chance to start my independent life in UK,"" said Valeriya. Jane said their experience highlighted that it can be ""extraordinarily difficult"" for Ukrainian refugees to find permanent accommodation. She believes the fact they could ""vouch for Valeriya 100%"" encouraged the estate agent, but the ""bottom line"" was them being able to guarantee their rent. ""I think it's going to be dreadful for all concerned,"" said Jane. ""I'm not sure why Wales suggested it wanted to be a superhost when we have insufficient housing and insufficient hosts."" Neither host families nor Welsh government-sponsored ""welcome centres"" are meant to be long-term options, but there are big waiting lists for social housing and private rentals are too expensive for many. With the war making a return home impossible for many, the future for some Ukrainians here is unclear. The UK government said more than 100,000 people arrived on the Homes for Ukraine scheme and the ""majority"" of hosts wanted to continue beyond six months. ""All arrivals have access to benefits and employment from day one and we are working with councils to ensure Ukrainians are receiving the help they need to access housing,"" a government spokesman said. ""Councils have a duty to ensure families are not left without a roof over their heads and they receive funding per person to cover any additional costs.""  About 6,000 Ukrainians have come to Wales, sponsored either by host families or the Welsh government as a ""super sponsor."" A further 2,300 visas have also been issued to Ukrainians with a sponsor in Wales. A survey by the Office for National Statistics suggested about a quarter of hosts planned to leave the scheme after six months and the Welsh government has appealed for more hosts.  The administration in Cardiff Bay said it has spent more than £500m in 2022 on social housing and housing support services.   ""We recognise the extreme pressures facing local authority housing teams, not just to accommodate people fleeing the war in Ukraine but all those in housing need,"" it added. ""We continue to work closely with them and registered social landlords to make more housing available through our £65m transitional accommodation capital programme."" The organisation that represents Wales' 22 local authorities - which are tasked with rehoming Ukrainian refugees -  said demand for social hosing was ""huge"" and no-one got special treatment. The Welsh Local Government Association leader has said Ukrainian refugees may actually be ""at a bit of a disadvantage"" because of a lack of local connections which can give people priority. ""We are looking at what the opportunities are in social housing but mainly trying to work with families around making them independent,"" said chief Andrew Morgan."
safe haven demand,Faisal Islam: Russia’s war economy cannot last but has bought time,2024-09-15,2024-02-11,Faisal Islam,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68249043,"It was March 2022. The Russian rouble crashed, the value in London of corporate giants Gazprom and Sberbank fell 97%. Queues began to form at cash machines in Moscow. Oligarchs' yachts, football teams, mansions and even their credit cards were seized. Russia crashed into a major recession. This was the immediate result of the most extraordinary attempt by the West at financial containment of Russia after its invasion of Ukraine. At its heart was the seizing of the Russian state's official foreign exchange assets and, in particular, the unprecedented freezing of the central bank's $300bn (£238bn) in reserves.  Western governments pointedly shied away from using phrases like ""economic war"", but it certainly seemed like there was a financial theatre of battle with the Kremlin. It was better than the alternative of direct confrontation between nuclear states. Some two years on and there is quite a change in this economic backdrop.  In a long and rambling interview this week, President Putin gleefully exclaimed Russia as the fastest growing economy in Europe.  Last week, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) underlined the resilience of the Russian economy when it upgraded its forecast growth for this year to 2.6% from 1.1%. Based on the IMF's figures, the Russian economy grew faster than the whole G7 last year, and will do so again in 2024. These are not just numbers. The stalemate in Ukraine last year and the growing expectation of a frozen conflict on the ground across this year, has been underpinned by Russia's remobilisation of its economy to its military effort, especially in the construction of defensive lines in the east and south of Ukraine.  Western leaders argue that this model is utterly unsustainable over the medium term. But the question is - for how long it can sustain? Russia has transformed its economy into a mobilised war economy. The Russian state is spending a record in the post-Soviet era. Military and security spending at up to 40% of the budget is back to late-Soviet era levels. Other areas of state support to the population have been squeezed to make up for funding the production of tanks, missile systems and those defences in occupied Ukraine. On top of that, despite Western restrictions on Russian oil and gas, the flows of hydrocarbon revenues have kept coming into the state coffers. The tankers are now going to India and China and more of the payments are in Chinese yuan rather than the US dollar. Russian oil production remains at 9.5 million barrels per day, barely down on pre-war levels. The country has skirted sanctions by buying and deploying a ""shadow fleet"" of hundreds of tankers. Last week, its finance ministry reported that hydrocarbon taxes in January exceeded levels seen in January 2022, just before the invasion. The ongoing flow of foreign exchange into Russian oil, gas, and diamonds has also helped alleviate the stress on the value of the rouble. Western leaders are adamant that this cannot last, but recognise its impact.  One world leader recently said privately: ""2024 will be much more positive for Putin than we thought. He has managed to reorganise his own industry more efficiently than we thought."" But this form of economic growth has greatly increased Moscow's dependence on oil revenues, on China and on non-productive war spending.  As demand for oil and gas peaks, and competitor production from the Gulf comes on-stream in the coming year, Russia will be exposed. Statistical rises in gross domestic product (GDP) from the production of tanks and shells that are then blown up in the Donbas, in eastern Ukraine, are also far from productive.  Meanwhile, Russia has experienced a brain drain of some of its most talented citizens.  The Western strategy has been not to lay siege to Russia's economy, but to engage in a cat and mouse game to restrict access to technology, raise costs, limit revenues and make the conflict unsustainable long-term. ""We'd rather Russia uses its money to buy tankers [for oil] than tanks"" one US official told me. In the oil market, the aim of policy is not to try to prevent India, for example, from buying Russian oil but to limit the profits from that trade going back to the Kremlin war machine. But this resilience and stalemate can last the rest of this year at least. It feeds into the clear strategy in the Kremlin of waiting for a possible change of US president and a reduction of Western funding for Ukraine's defence. That is why attention is now turning back to the central role of those hundreds of billions in frozen Russian financial assets.  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told me last month: ""If the world has $300bn, why not use it?"" All of those frozen funds should be deployed to fund Ukraine's rebuilding effort, he said. The UK's Chancellor Jeremy Hunt and Foreign Secretary David Cameron back the move.  Lord Cameron told me: ""We've frozen these assets. The question is are we going to use them?""  He said ""using some of this money now is if you like an advance payment on [Russian] reparations"" for its illegal invasion of Ukraine, and could be used ""to help Ukraine and save Western taxpayers money at the same time"". The G7 has asked its central bankers to come up with a technical and legal analysis. Central bankers are understood to be uneasy. One top financier told me there would be risks to what he called ""weaponising the dollar"". Traditionally, central banks enjoy sovereign immunity from these sorts of actions. A plan being developed would use the funds, or the profits from the investments to raise tens of billions of dollars for Ukraine.  But it is a balancing act. If Russian assets are seized in this way, then what message does it send to other nations, perhaps in the Gulf, or Central Asia, or Africa, about the safety of their safe-haven reserves in Western central banks? These relationships are some of the central arteries of global finance, recycling hundreds of billions of dollars used to pay for energy, across the world. Putin certainly wished to communicate that China was now emerging as an alternative, if not for the West, then for emerging economies. The Russians have also indicated that they will take court action over any seizure, and in turn take similar assets from Western companies frozen in Russian banks. So the shadow battle over Russia's economy is essential to understanding where this conflict and the world economy, is going.  Russia's war economy can not sustain long-term, but has bought the country some extra time. The West is about to up the ante, after Russia displayed this unexpected resilience.  The precise form of this financial escalation will have consequences, well beyond Russia and Ukraine."
