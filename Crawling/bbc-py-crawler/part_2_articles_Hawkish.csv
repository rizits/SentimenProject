Hawkish,RNLI reduces patrols as peak season ends,2024-09-25,2024-09-01,Elliot Ball,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly9z1d484eo,"Beachgoers have been warned to choose a lifeguarded beach as patrols end at a number of beaches in Devon and Cornwall later as the peak summer season finishes. The RNLI said there would be a reduced lifeguarding service at some beaches and there would be no more patrols at others this year. It advised people to only swim between red and yellow flags. Guy Botterill, the RNLI's regional lifeguard lead for the South West, said: ""I would like to remind people that if you are planning on going to the coast to do so at a lifeguarded beach."" The RNLI said patrols would end at 11 beaches in Cornwall including Northcott, Crackington Haven, Marazion, Carbis Bay, Mexico Towans, Porthkidney, Lusty Glaze, Porthleven, Gunwalloe, Freathy and Polurrian Cove. Seven patrols would end at Devon beaches including Bigbury-On-Sea, Slapton Sands, Blackpool Sands, Hope Cove, Teignmouth, Dawlish Warren and Sandy Bay. Mr Botterill advised people to ""float to live"" if they get in trouble by lying flat on your back with your ears submerged. Follow BBC Cornwall on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

Hawkish,Exmouth beach pollution sparks no swim warning,2024-09-25,2024-09-02,George Thorpe,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gz0rz6pleo,"People have been told not to swim at a Devon beach after pollution was detected there for the second time in three days. The Environment Agency (EA) said it had issued advice against bathing at Exmouth on Monday following a discharge at a South West Water (SWW) sewage storm overflow. It followed a separate incident at Exmouth on Saturday reported by East Devon District Council (EDDC) which led to no swim advice being issued at Exmouth for several hours. A SWW spokesperson said heavy rainfall had caused its Maer Road pumping station storm overflow to operate and apologised to those impacted. The EA added warnings had also been put in place on Monday in Seaton, Budleigh Salterton and Dawlish, but these were not linked to the Exmouth incident. In August, people were also advised not to swim at Exmouth on 15 August and the weekend of 17 August. The EA said the discharge in Exmouth on Monday coincided with heavy overnight rain. It added a site controller was sent to the beach to carry out an investigation. ""The advice will remain in place for two tidal cycles and we are reviewing whether or not the discharge was in line with SWW’s permit to discharge,"" the EA said. EDDC leader Paul Arnott said SWW's handling of pollution issues in recent weeks had been ""unacceptable"". He added the council would be working with the EA to monitor bathing water quality. ""These sewage spillages risk the health of residents and visitors, as well as impacting the wider environment,"" Mr Arnott said. SWW said sudden and heavy rainfall overnight on Monday led to the storm overflow in Maer Road to operate to ""protect homes and businesses from flooding"". ""We are fully investigating what happened, but we are sorry that a pollution incident occurred,"" a SWW spokesperson said. ""One pollution is one too many and we are doing everything we can to protect the environment as we work around the clock to complete a very complex work in Exmouth."" Speaking about Saturday's incident, SWW said on Facebook the spillage came from a temporary tank feeding an overland pipeline. The post said: ""The cause was due to human error, and the new processes were immediately put in place to make sure this doesn't happen again. ""We're truly sorry for the disruption this has caused the local community."" Follow BBC Devon on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram. Send your story ideas to spotlight@bbc.co.uk."
Hawkish,Walz has history with China - it's more hawkish than critics claim,2024-09-25,2024-08-07,John Sudworth,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgewpzyd91o,"Within hours of Tim Walz being declared winner of the Democratic ""veepstakes"", Republican accusations that he is pro-China came thick and fast. ""Communist China is very happy,"" Donald Trump's former ambassador to Germany, Richard Grenell, said on Twitter/X. ""No one is more pro-China than Marxist Walz."" Tom Cotton, a Republican senator, said Mr Walz owed an explanation ""about his unusual, 35-year relationship with Communist China"". MAGA War Room, an influential X account supporting Donald Trump, unearthed a 2016 video in which Mr Walz told the farming policy outlet Agri-Pulse that the US and China did not need to have an ""adversarial relationship"". But what does the record show? Republicans may want to weaponise Mr Walz's links to China, but it's pretty slim pickings. Mr Walz's personal relationship with China does indeed extend back decades.  It began in 1989 when, fresh out of college, Mr Walz began a Harvard University volunteer programme teaching American history and English at the Foshan No 1 High School in southern China. He later set up a business with his wife Gwen organising annual summer educational trips to China. The venture lasted more than a decade and by his own estimation, Mr Walz returned to the country around 30 times.  But if anything, Mr Walz has been pretty hawkish towards its government, particularly on human rights. As a congressman, he met the Dalai Lama and – before his jailing – the high-profile Hong Kong democracy activist, Joshua Wong. Both men would place at the top of the Chinese government’s list of public enemies. In terms of his congressional record, there is not much for China to like. He spent over a decade on the Congressional-Executive Commission on China – a body focused on scrutinising the Chinese government’s human rights abuses. In 2016, the same year he met the Dalai Lama, he also invited the then leader of Tibet's government in exile, Lobsang Sangay, into his congressional office to meet a group of Minnesota high-schoolers. Mr Walz lent his strong backing to the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, which imposed sanctions on Chinese and Hong Kong officials for human rights abuses during the city's democracy protests. Jeffrey Ngo, a democracy activist now based in the US, has praised Mr Walz's commitment to getting the legislation passed in 2019. ""We knocked on every door when the #HKHRDA lacked momentum,"" he wrote on X after Mr Walz was confirmed as the Harris VP choice. ""Only Walz answered his.""  Mr Ngo praised Mr Walz as ""the sole House Democrat willing to keep co-sponsoring the bill"". Republican Chris Smith was the bill's other sponsor. Mr Walz's elevation to the Democratic ticket has prompted interest on Chinese social media. He once described his decision to teach in China as ""one of the best things I've ever done"", and there were signs of hope in some of the comments that, if he wins, it may signal better US-China ties. One Weibo user pointed out that Walz's ""unique background gives him a real perspective on China"", and he could ""promote cultural exchanges when... relations are extremely difficult"". But others wondered whether that may be assuming too much. The fact that his teaching posting took place in 1989 - the year of the Tiananmen Square massacre in Beijing - was not lost on some. The Chinese cannot say much about the massacre for risk of getting censored. They refer to it obliquely - one comment simply said ""if you know, you know"". Foreigners who were in China at that time ""are the most anti-China"", said another user. Indeed, Mr Walz has often spoken publicly about his horror at the crushing of the Tiananmen protests, and in 2009 he co-sponsored a resolution in Congress marking its 20th anniversary. His wife Gwen has said that the events had such an effect on Walz, that he chose 4 June - the day Beijing sent the troops in - as the date of their wedding five years later. She said that ""he wanted to have a date he'll always remember"". For more than two decades after Tiananmen, America's foreign policy was founded on a deep, bipartisan agreement that trade and engagement with China was broadly a good thing. It is no surprise that evidence can be found of Mr Walz expressing views that align with that consensus. On the flip side, Donald Trump's own-brand suits and ties were made in China, and he and his daughter Ivanka registered dozens of trademarks there. Far from being pro-China, Mr Walz's record marks him out as someone who has taken a more nuanced view.  He has spoken of the need for dialogue and cooperation on issues such as trade and climate change - but remains fiercely critical when it comes to human rights. That stance was in evidence from the very start of the relationship. When returning to Nebraska after his year in China, he told a local newspaper that there were ""no limits"" to what the Chinese could accomplish. ""If they had proper leadership,"" he added."
Hawkish,Sadness as 'shabby' brook blights town's look,2024-09-25,2024-08-15,George Thorpe,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c624g473m4yo,"A Devon seaside town is losing its ""picture postcard"" look due to the state of a stream running through it, locals have said. Residents are unhappy as the Dawlish Water stream, which goes through the town and into the sea, has had piles of silt build up since it was last dredged several years ago. They want Teignbridge District Council (TDC) and the Environment Agency (EA) to dredge the waterway and to cut back vegetation. TDC and EA said dredging had limited benefits and were working on solutions for the issues raised. Dredging is done to remove silt from waterways and to help prevent flooding. Linda Stubbs said she had spent the majority of her life living in Dawlish and the brook - which is home to animals including black swans - was in the worst state she had ever seen it. She added: ""You could never, do what you can do and, walk on the river - it was always kept clean. ""It's really sad to see that my hometown is going downhill."" Wendy Chadwick, owner of the Puzzled Sweet Shop, said she feared tourists would stop coming to the town due to the poor state of the brook. ""You couldn't put this on a postcard now - this is not postcard material,"" she said. Rosie Dawson, TDC chair and a member of Dawlish Town Council, said locals wanted to see action taken: ""I think there's a really strong feeling that the place is looking shabby."" EA officials said they were working with TDC and other partners on solutions, but dredging was not necessarily the answer. An EA spokesperson said: ""The removal of silt through dredging is very costly and investigations have shown it offers very little benefit to Dawlish in terms of flood protection or value for money."" A TDC spokesperson said dredging was an ""extremely complex and costly operation"" that had limited flood risk benefits. Follow BBC Devon on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

Hawkish,Mobility scooter thief who left man to die is jailed,2024-09-25,2024-08-29,Steve Knibbs,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj62dkekz74o,"A woman who stole a disabled man's mobility scooter, dragged him along the ground, and left him for dead has been jailed. Kimberley Ann Hawkins, 41, pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of Neil Shadwick, 63, in Gloucestershire, following the incident in January 2023. Mr Shadwick's eldest daughter, Victoria Bentley, said her ""incredibly vulnerable"" father must have been ""terrified"" at being left to die in a supermarket car park in sub-zero temperatures. Hawkins, of no fixed address, was sentenced at Gloucester Crown Court to six and a half years in jail.   Mr Shadwick was found unresponsive in a Tesco car park on Stratford Road in Stroud on 22 January, when the Met Office had forecast temperatures as low as -6°C overnight. CCTV footage showed Hawkins and Mr Shadwick, who had severe Parkinson’s,  arriving at the supermarket at about 02:30 GMT to use the cash machine. When Mr Shadwick appeared unable to withdraw money for Hawkins, she became ""frustrated"" and took his mobility scooter while he was still partially on it. She dragged him along the road for just under a minute before he eventually let go, then she rode away, leaving him on the ground.  He was found by supermarket staff who arrived for work at about 05:45 GMT. Mr Shadwick had severe hypothermia, pneumonia and lung injuries. In the ambulance, all he was able to say was ""robbed"" and ""Kim"". He later died in hospital. In a statement, his daughter, Mrs Bentley, said it was ""horrific"" to identify her dad ""under such terrible circumstances"". ""Kimberley Hawkins knew by leaving Dad in that car park, on a freezing cold night, that she was leaving an incredibly vulnerable man who had no way of communicating as he could barely talk,"" Mrs Bentley said. ""He didn't have a phone and he had no way of getting any help. ""He must have been terrified realising that he'd been abandoned and not knowing when or if help would arrive."" The court heard the pair had gone to the cashpoint after Hawkins provided ""sexual services"" for Mr Shadwick. Mr Shadwick’s younger sister, who lost both of her brothers within three months, said he ""did not deserve to be treated and abandoned in this way"". Tania Rickards said her brother had health problems ""from a young age"", and eventually had to give up his career as a HGV driver in 2003 following a Parkinson's diagnosis in his early 30s. Mr Shadwick's brother, Kevin, had been diagnosed with terminal cancer in August 2022, and was given six months to live that November. ""After Christmas 2022, we had said that we will get January over and then we would try and get Neil transport to come down and meet up with Kevin, but we never got the chance to do that,"" Mrs Rickards said. ""It would have been the last time we were all together but Kimberley Hawkins robbed us of being able to do that."" Mary Cowe, prosecuting, told the court Mr Shadwick was “extremely vulnerable” and lived in supported accommodation, relying on carers visiting him four times a day. Describing the incident that led to his death, Miss Cowe said: “It was selfish and spiteful but not premeditated. “She [Hawkins] told a friend she had performed sexual favours for Mr Shadwick and he couldn’t pay.” Hawkins was jailed for six years for the manslaughter of Mr Shadwick.  A further six months was added consecutively for related offences of aggravated vehicle taking and assault occasioning actual bodily harm plus other charges of theft, drug possession and breach of previous suspended sentences. Det Insp Adam Stacey, who led the investigation, said: “Hawkins’ actions were callous, and they had fatal consequences for a man whom she knew was extremely vulnerable. “The footage from the early hours of that morning is heartbreaking to watch, as Neil Shadwick was abandoned in sub-zero temperatures in the street without his mobility scooter and therefore unable to seek shelter or help. “The family feel robbed that they didn’t get the chance to say goodbye to Neil, as he was cruelly taken away from them.” Follow BBC Gloucestershire on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

Hawkish,"What to know about US election hacking, Iran and other countries",2024-09-25,2024-08-16,Gordon Corera,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c86ljyv38vxo,"The recent claim by Donald Trump's campaign that they were hacked by Iran is one sign that foreign interference may become a prominent issue in this year's US election. The election result will have major implications around the world, meaning many countries have an incentive to try and interfere to either support a particular candidate or just to destabilise America.  And the nature of America’s open democracy and media, coupled with new forms of technology, provides many potential avenues to try and shape the eventual outcome. “Our adversaries do look at American elections as points to try to influence, to try to undermine confidence in our democracy, to try to put their thumb on the scale,” National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said last month. “We are clear eyed about that. And we are doing a lot to push back against it"". So who might be trying to interfere? Three countries are most widely cited: Iran, Russia and China. “Iran is becoming increasingly aggressive in their foreign influence efforts, seeking to stoke discord and undermine confidence in our democratic institutions,” US Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines said in July.  The Trump campaign says it was hacked by Iran, although it has not been confirmed that an offer of stolen campaign documents to news outlets was definitely linked to this. Microsoft recently said it had seen ""the emergence of significant influence activity"" by groups linked to Iran, and Google has said Iranian hackers targeted the Biden campaign (before he dropped out of the race) as well as that of Donald Trump. The assessment is that the Iranians are more likely to be opposed to a return of Trump to the White House.  He and his advisers are seen as more hawkish in their rhetoric as well as in their past actions, which include pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal and killing top Iranian General Qasem Soleimani in January 2020.  On social media, Iran has also been accused of stoking tensions over Gaza. “Russia remains the predominant threat to US elections,” according to the most recent assessment by US intelligence.  But so far it has been less visible than Iran. Russia has a long track record of using what it calls ""active measures"" to influence public opinion back through the Cold War.  And in 2016, the US was caught largely unaware by a Russian operation which saw the Democratic Party as well as Hillary Clinton's campaign operatives have their emails hacked and then leaked. Russian hackers – likely from both the foreign intelligence agency the SVR and the military intelligence agency the GRU – are among the most skilled and may try to compromise accounts.  Russian social media campaigns have also moved on from 2016 when fake profiles were used to organise real-world demonstrations against Hillary Clinton during the campaign. Moscow is thought to be outsourcing some efforts to commercial firms in order to distance itself and look for more effective ways of reaching audiences. If Moscow does get involved, security analysts believe it it would most likely be to favour Trump. The former president has been more friendly to Moscow and more critical of the NATO defence alliance. Russia's Vladimir Putin recently denied he was backing Trump, but even that was seen as a diversionary tactic. China is the wildcard in terms of interference.  It has hacked US campaigns to gather intelligence all the way back to 2008. But it tends to be less active than the other two in trying to influence a particular result. US intelligence currently believe it ""probably does not plan to influence the outcome"" of the election. There is also less confidence as to who China’s preferred candidate might be should it decide to do anything.  Donald Trump can be unpredictable and confrontational with Beijing but is less likely to continue the Biden administration’s policy of building a web of alliances, which has worried Beijing.  Beijing may also be wary of antagonising the US at this point by being seen to interfere, something neither Iran nor Russia worry so much about. But China is accused of trying to target candidates at a local or congressional level because of their backgrounds or positions on issues of concern to China. In the 2022 mid-terms it was assessed of doing so in a handful of races involving both Democrats and Republicans. All three countries have consistently denied carrying out election interference operations. Back in 2016, material hacked by Russia received extensive media coverage. But that seems to have changed now with media outlets more cautious about giving prominence to stolen data.  And there there are more people now looking for influence operations as well as improved cybersecurity defences around campaigns. But despite this, the challenge has evolved. One complexity is that it can be harder to disentangle foreign interference from domestic free speech. Some countries may use Americans to seed or spread their messages. Sometimes those Americans will be willing collaborators, but sometimes they will be unwitting, perhaps even engaged to write for websites which they do not know work for Moscow or someone else. And there are new worries because there has been a step change in the technology on offer to those seeking to interfere thanks to artificial intelligence and deepfakes. These potentially allow more tailored approaches to individuals over social media, and the creation of more convincing faked content. This could lead people to doubt what is real and what is not.  However, in other elections around the world this year, the general consensus is that these techniques have not been deployed as much as some feared.  But America’s election is by far the most consequential globally (and also likely a tight race) meaning new techniques might be deployed for the first time. And given the political atmosphere this time is more combustible and polarised than in the past. A further risk, too, is that even the claim that there has been foreign interference can be politicised and used to cast doubt on an election result. "
Hawkish,No bail for activists kicked off Zimbabwe plane,2024-09-25,2024-08-16,Shingai Nyoka in Harare & Natasha Booty in London,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2n5rg63r6o,"Three Zimbabwean activists who were arrested in dramatic fashion after being forced off an aeroplane last month have been denied bail, on the eve of a high-profile international summit in the country. Robson Chere, Namatai Kwekweza and Samuel Gwenzi have been charged with disorderly conduct for allegedly protesting outside a court in June about the arrest of dozens of opposition supporters. The magistrate ruled they were likely to abscond, could commit other offences and cause public despondency, according to Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights (ZLHR). A lawyer representing the trio says they were held for hours without access to a legal representative and tortured soon after their arrest. The three had been heading to the Zimbabwean resort town of Victoria Falls to attend a conference when they were hauled off the domestic flight. Mr Chere - the leader of a teachers’ union - had bloodstained clothes and limped in pain during his first court appearance earlier this month. Women rights advocate Ms Kwekweza says she was not even in the country when the alleged offence occurred. Her lawyer told an earlier hearing that she had had a boot shoved in her mouth during her interrogation. A lawyer for Mr Gwenzi, a local councillor and human rights activist, had also described how his client's interrogators had threatened to harm his family.  UN-appointed human rights experts have called for the group to be released immediately and have all charges against them dropped. On Saturday, Zimbabwe's President Emmerson Mnangagwa will officially take over as chairman of southern Africa's 16-nation regional bloc, Southern African Development Community (Sadc). The summit will be held in the capital, Harare, with an audience of other heads of state. More than 160 people opposition politicians, activists and union leaders have been arrested by Zimbabwean authorities since mid-June, human rights groups have said. Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International say they have found evidence of torture and believe that the arrests set a dangerous tone for Sadc's commitment to human rights under Mr Mnangagwa's chairmanship. In a joint statement the two rights groups urged Sadc leaders to condemn Zimbabwe's human rights violations and press for the release of those arrested. In recent days, according to ZLHR, two politicians belonging to the main opposition Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC) have also been arrested.

Hawkish,"Phone taps, sabotage and an assassination plot: Is Germany in Cold War 2.0?",2024-09-25,2024-08-17,Jessica Parker,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyn8vk4g42o,"Holes mysteriously found cut in army base fences. An alleged plot to assassinate Germany’s top weapons manufacturer. Phone taps on a high-level Luftwaffe call. These aren’t storylines lifted from a 1960s spy novel but real-life events in Germany, this year. Not all of these events can definitively be blamed on Moscow, but Germany is on heightened alert for possible acts of Russian sabotage, because of Berlin’s continued military support for Kyiv. As a hot war rages between Russia and Ukraine, there are fears that Europe has slipped into a new Cold War. “When we think of the Cold War, we have a tendency to think of the 1970s by which point the rules of the game had become established and accepted,” says Mark Galeotti, a senior fellow at the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi) and director of Mayak Intelligence. “In some way, we’re in the early Cold War – the Fifties and Sixties, so a much rawer time.” But what does a rekindled Cold War look like for Europe’s biggest economy and a country that was once itself cut in half by the Iron Curtain? The biggest bombshell dropped just last month when CNN reported that US officials had told Berlin of an alleged Russian plot to kill the chief executive of Germany’s biggest arms company Rheinmetall. The Kremlin denied the report but German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, who strikes a hawkish figure next to the more hesitant Chancellor Olaf Scholz, hit out at Russia for “waging a hybrid war of aggression"". I met Rheinmetall’s CEO, Armin Papperger, at a ground-breaking ceremony for a new ammunition factory in February. The 61-year-old is, to use a crude term, a real “somebody”, particularly in a world where Nato countries are spending billions to re-supply Ukraine and boost their own security. His prominent position was clear as he stood alongside Chancellor Scholz, Defence Minister Boris Pistorius and Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen as they plunged spades into the earth in Lower Saxony. Had a plot to kill him been successful, it would have sent shockwaves through the West. A security blunder not long afterwards allowed spies to eavesdrop on a highly sensitive conversation between senior German air force officials, later broadcast on Russian TV. It was a cause of acute embarrassment for Berlin given that a brigadier general in the Luftwaffe appeared to allow spies into the secure call by dialling in on an insecure line. The mega-blip, however isolated, fuelled accusations that Germany has long been a “weak link” within the European counter-intelligence due to a fragmented, federalised system that’s underpinned by a strong emphasis on individuals’ privacy. Weeks later, two German-Russian nationals were arrested on suspicion of planning to sabotage US military facilities in Bavaria. Annalena Baerbock summoned the Russian ambassador to complain and announced: “We will not allow Putin to bring his terror to Germany.” Only last week, holes were found cut into the fences of water facilities supplying two military bases in North Rhine-Westphalia, with concerns that someone has been seeking to contaminate supplies.  Germany is not the only European country being targeted by apparent acts of sabotage, but it has a lot of US military bases that were established in the wake of World War Two. Mark Galeotti believes Moscow views Germany as a large but “flabby” power, making it the ideal pressure point. By anyone’s measure, the greatest act of known sabotage to affect Germany in recent years was when the Nord Stream gas pipelines, running under the Baltic Sea from Russia, were blown up in 2022. Speculation over who ordered the attack has been rife ever since, but in a dramatic development Germany has now issued an arrest warrant for a Ukrainian diving instructor. Last week the Wall Street Journal reported that the “shoestring” operation had been privately funded but overseen from Ukraine. Kyiv rejected the report as nonsense, and while there was always scepticism that President Putin would order the destruction of his own pipeline, it does show that the murky world of espionage can be full of twists and turns. Each incident of apparent sabotage cannot, by any means, be immediately and certainly attributed to Russia. In France it was far-left activists, not Russian agents, who were accused of targeting the country’s high-speed rail network on the eve of the Olympics. And Germany has had its own, extensive, history of far-left militant attacks. The fact that Ukrainian figures are now under the spotlight for the Nord Stream blasts has fuelled fresh criticism from familiar political wings, within Germany, about the government’s support for Kyiv. Co-leader of the far-right Alternative for Deutschland, Alice Weidel, has called for “aid payments” to Kyiv to be halted and the damage to Nord Stream “billed” to Ukraine. The AfD enjoys much of its support in the former communist east, where beyond Berlin you’re more likely to find lingering affection for Russia and dissatisfaction with the main parties that have, since reunification, dominated national politics. So as Cold War comparisons hover over European security, the politics of that period has also renewed itself in Germany in a stark and unexpected way. In a bid to bolster security, the German government is working on a new law aimed at boosting resilience of critical infrastructure. German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser says there must be “maximum protective measures in all areas”. Operators in critical sectors such as energy, transport and water will have to follow minimum security standards, under the Kritis Umbrella Act. It’s the first federal law of its kind in Germany but yet to gain final approval despite heightened tensions surrounding the war. German-made armoured Marder vehicles are reportedly being used in Ukraine’s surprise operation inside Russian territory. That would mark yet another German foreign policy taboo being broken since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Add to that contentious plans for the US to station long-range missiles in Germany from 2026. When Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine began, Chancellor Sholz promised a “Zeitenwende”, or turning point in national defence and security policy. But supporters and critics of the government alike acknowledge that reversing years of underinvestment in defence will take time – as will adjusting a mentality so influenced by Germany’s dark past.

Hawkish,Tiffany Haddish defends Zimbabwe video after backlash,2024-09-25,2024-07-29,Danai Nesta Kupemba,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3g6d6xlwzxo,"American comedian Tiffany Haddish has defended her controversial TikTok video of her visit to a supermarket in Zimbabwe, saying it was aimed at dispelling perceptions that there was ""war everyday"" in Africa.  Haddish faced a backlash from some Zimbabweans on social media after she posted the video of her strolling through the aisles of a supermarket chain in the capital, Harare. ""Look at this grocery store. It's humungous, in Africa,"" she says in disbelief as she scans rows of shelves with soft drinks, frozen meat and fresh fruit. The video has been viewed just over 200,000 times on TikTok. ""How ignorant could she be? Did she think that Africans shop from rocks? She needs to travel more and unclog her sadly colonized view of the world. Yikes,"" raged one user on X.  Another person said: ""They think we’re chasing lions and zebras."" A third person said that Americans have a ""misguided perception of Africa, believing that its inhabitants live in primitive conditions, residing in mud huts, lacking access to clean water, and being devoid of modern amenities like electricity and internet"". Haddish responded to the criticism on X , saying that she had been taught a false narrative about Africa.  ""I am an American, a Black one at that, and told for years that people are starving in Africa, showed pictures of babies with flies on them."" She added that she was told ""crazy stories"" about how Africans ""kill each other"" and there is ""war everyday"".  But Haddish said that her trip to Zimbabwe has opened her eyes and that she has been ""finding out the truth ""about the continent"".  ""I thought I would share cause I know people in the USA that believe Africans don’t have anything,"" she wrote.  Some have come to her defence. ""We like that you like our grocery store and all the products that shocked you are just basics here as well, we really aren’t in the forest hanging on trees,"" said a voice of support for the actress.  The comedian is half-Eritrean and visited Eritrea for the first time in 2018. She praised long time ruler Isaias Afwerki, who has been described by his critics as a  ""dictator"".

Hawkish,Former hospital to go up for auction again ,2024-09-25,2024-07-25,Guy Henderson,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c51y9qz891xo,"The site of a former hospital in Devon is going up for auction again, health chiefs have confirmed. Torbay and South Devon NHS Foundation Trust said the former Dartmouth and Kingswear Community Hospital would be auctioned on 18 September. It will be the third attempt to dispose of the property, which was one of a number of community hospitals closed by the trust in 2017. The building, on the embankment overlooking the River Dart, was nearly sold in January but the preferred bidder fell through. The reported guide price at the July auction was about £1.5m. Jake O'Donovan, director of workplace for the trust, said there was ""a number of interested parties who may make a bid on the site prior to auction"". ""We will continue to ensure that any sale of either site is in line with the NHS estate code,"" he said. South Hams District Council approved an application to have the building registered as an asset of community value, meaning community groups will have six weeks to express an interest in bidding for the property. The trust said the site was no longer needed for healthcare and needed to be sold to help fund the recently opened £5.4m health and wellbeing hub in the town. Mr O’Donovan said: ""The new centre supports a much more joined-up approach to health and wellbeing services for local people in state-of-the-art, purpose-designed facilities.""

Hawkish,Man jailed for stabbing dog walker with scissors,2024-09-25,2024-07-24,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c99we57kjzzo,"A ""dangerous"" man has been jailed for stabbing a female dog walker in the head with a pair of scissors in a Devon town. At a trial in June, Exeter Crown Court heard passers-by tried to intervene in an argument Joshua Kettle, 29, was having with his brother in St Paul's Road in Newton Abbot on 5 February. The court was told Kettle, previously of Sandringham Road, Newton Abbot, punched one man, leaving him with a broken tooth and bruising, before he then stabbed the woman in her temple with a pair of scissors, leaving a gash that needed five stitches. On Wednesday, Kettle was jailed for five-and-a-half years by Recorder Ms Chloe Pawson-Pounds, with a two-year extended licence. At the trial, Kettle denied but was found guilty of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, possession of a bladed article, affray and assaulting an emergency worker. He admitted assault causing actual bodily harm and two other assaults on emergency workers.  The court heard Kettle had assaulted a police officer at a custody suite the next day after his arrest by spitting at them. It also heard Kettle had a documented history of poor mental health. Sentencing, Ms Chloe Pawson-Pounds said Kettle was a ""dangerous offender"". She said: “You have a not insignificant record of violence and this marks an escalation in seriousness.  ""You have assaulted individuals without provocation while using weapons, having armed yourself on three occasions. “Your attitude towards your mental health and understanding of how it causes your offending behaviour is unrealistic and that is a cause for concern. Mercifully, you haven’t caused more serious injury so far.” Miss Felicity Payne, defending, said Kettle, of no fixed abode during sentencing, had a history of mental health problems which reduced his culpability.  She said he had been released from a spell at Langdon Hospital in Dawlish shortly before these offences and had problems accessing medication.

In March 2023, Ukrainian national Albina Yevko, 14, also fell to her death from the sea wall while running alongside the railway line.

""We will be taking into account the particular circumstances of the incident on 13 July, 2024, in our risk assessment of the entire sea wall, old and new,"" it said.

Hawkish,Senior North Korean diplomat defects to South,2024-09-25,2024-07-16,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpv3xk9klwzo,"A high-profile North Korean diplomat stationed in Cuba has defected to the South, Seoul's spy agency has confirmed to the BBC. The political counselor is believed to be the highest-ranking North Korean diplomat to escape to South Korea since 2016. The diplomat defected in November, the National Intelligence Service (NIS) said. Details about defections of North Koreans often take months to come to light as the defectors must take courses on South Korean society before they are formally integrated.   South Korean media reports say that the defector was a counsellor responsible for political affairs at the North Korean embassy in Cuba. The NIS has not confirmed this to the BBC. The Chosun Ilbo newspaper said it was able to interview the diplomat, whom it identified as 52-year-old Ri Il Kyu. It added that he defected because of ""disillusionment with the North Korean regime and a bleak future"". His work reportedly involved stopping Havana from forging official diplomatic ties with Seoul. However, in February, the  two governments did establish official relations, in what was seen as a setback for Pyongyang. ""Every North Korean thinks at least once about living in South Korea,"" the newspaper quoted him as saying. The last known high-profile defection to the South was that of Tae Yong-ho in 2016. He is North Korea's former deputy ambassador to the United Kingdom. On Sunday, South Korea marked its very first North Korean Defectors' Day ceremony. Addressing the ceremony, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol promised better financial support for North Korean defectors and tax incentives for companies hiring them. Mr Yoon, a conservative, has taken a more hawkish approach towards North Korea and on foreign policy general, compared to his predecessor Moon Jae-In. He supports sanctions against Kim Jong Un's regime and has promised to develop technology to carry out a pre-emptive strike on North Korea if Pyongyang looks to attack Seoul. The latest defection comes at a time of heightened tensions between the two Koreas. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has formally abandoned the goal of reunification with with the South and also recently branded Seoul as ""Enemy number One"" - a dramatic turnaround from just six years ago when he formally met then South Korean Leader Moon Jae In. Since then, there has been an upping of rhetoric on both sides of the border.  The two countries floated propaganda balloons along their border towns, with those from the North containing trash and parasites. And earlier in June, Pyongyang claimed to have test-fired an advanced nuclear warhead missile. "

""They need to be equipped and trained to help people safely, as well as providing assistance to other agencies.""  Devon and Cornwall Police said it was the first force in the country to train officers in this new programme. Earlier, a demonstration in Exmouth took place in partnership with Surf Life Saving GB. Acting Ch Insp Bayliss said: ""We already include some aspects of land-based rescue in our current training, but we wanted to work with experts to develop enhanced training that will benefit everyone."" The training included enhanced public and police safety work and improved first-aid training.  Adrian Mayhew, director of national operations and safety for Surf Life Saving GB, said he was ""very pleased"" to help the police improve officer training.  He said: ""The more people who understand the principles of safe land-based rescue, the better. ""Sadly, many people who enter the water to help someone in distress end up becoming victims themselves. ""Even on a blisteringly hot summer’s day, the water around our coast can be very cold and cause your body to go into shock, even if you are a strong swimmer."" He said the safest option was always to attempt a rescue from the shore first. Mr Mayhew also advised calling 999 and asking for the coastguard.

Hawkish,Town's last bank closes as new banking hub opens,2024-09-25,2024-07-17,Johanna Carr,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cxx2r80d13go,"A new shared banking hub has opened in Saltash as the last bank branch in the Cornish town prepares to close its doors for the final time. Lloyds Bank on Fore Street will close for good later, following on from the closures of other high street banks there, including Barclays and Nat West.  The Banking Hub, which was officially opened on Monday, allows customers of most major banks and building societies to carry out regular cash transactions. Saltash mayor Councillor Julia Peggs said everybody would be ""sad to see Lloyds go"" but added the hub was a ""fantastic facility"".  Mrs Peggs said: ""We all know that face-to-face banking and being able to speak to somebody is really important, and especially for the businesses as well to be able to do their banking, so everybody's really excited."" She said all of the councillors had been getting emails and calls from residents concerned about the closure of Lloyds. A Lloyds spokesperson said: ""As many customers now choose to bank online or through their mobile app, visits to our Saltash branch have fallen over recent years."" The bank said customers could still use its services online, on the phone, in branch in Plymouth, or either the local Post Office or Banking Hub. Customer Sue Wayne said she was ""going to miss Lloyds very much"", adding the closure of branches concerned her. ""It's affecting cash, I think we're going to become a cashless society far too quickly,"" she said. She said she was aware of the new Banking Hub on Lower Fore Street, which she said ""seemed to be in the wrong place for shoppers but at least we've got something"" and added she planned to use it in the future. Christine West, who used to bank at Barclays in the town before it closed in 2018, said the hub would ""make life so much easier for everybody"". Banks and building societies have closed 6,005 branches since January 2015, at a rate of around 53 each month, consumer group Which? said. Carmen Hanif, from the Devon Federation of Small Businesses, said its research showed 40% of banks and building societies closed their doors between 2012 and 2022. But she said at the same time a quarter of high street businesses said cash was still their preferred payment method. Ms Hanif said: ""Banking Hubs are fantastic, they're a great option where there are no banks and building societies still available, but longer term what we really want to be doing is stopping the current banks and building societies from closing their doors ... healthy economies are built on being able to process payments and cash is still a massive part of healthy economies."" The are currently two other banking hubs in Cornwall, in Looe and Helston, with a fourth planned for Bodmin. In Devon, there are hubs in Teignmouth, Dawlish, Axminster and Brixham with more planned for Dawlish and Dartmouth.  Steven Boyd, who manages the Looe and Saltash hubs for the Post Office, which operates them in partnership with major banks, said they were ""designed for the community"". ""So the amount of support we get back from the community is vital for future growth but also to tell the banks how much we want them still in our towns, albeit in a slightly different format,"" he said.

The theoretical physicist died in 2018, aged 76, and his family donated the items to Cambridge University Library in 2021. Tens of thousands of pages including scientific archives, photographs with public figures and scripts from television shows such as The Simpsons are included in the collection. There is also correspondence demonstrating how Hawking was an active campaigner on issues including disability rights and nuclear disarmament. In a letter to the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden, from 1978, Hawking wrote that there were ""no facilities at all for disabled people"". He cited the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970 and demanded better access to the building. In a letter to his parents from 1986, which begins ""Dear mother and father"", Hawking dictates the text using his now famous communication system which he acquired after his tracheostomy the same year. ""I'm writing this letter on my new computer which also speaks but a bit like a Dalek with an American accent,"" he said in the letter. ""It is very useful for communicating but it is too big to carry around. ""However I have another one which I may be able to get fixed to my chair."" Hawking archivist Susan Gordon, who has spent the past 28 months cataloguing the collection, said the papers revealed how ""the same tenacity Hawking displayed in his professional career was applied to advocating for causes he believed in"". She said: ""The archive will be a unique resource for researchers interested in Hawking's scientific work and academic life, his personal life, popular science communication, disability rights, assistive technology, and celebrity.

Hawkish,Mum admits ending life of terminally ill son,2024-09-25,2024-07-03,"Sophie Law, Charlotte Andrews & Marcus White",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn33z53pv3vo,"A mother has admitted giving her terminally ill seven-year-old son a large dose of morphine to stop his suffering and ""quietly end his life"". Antonya Cooper, from Abingdon, Oxfordshire, said her son Hamish had stage 4 cancer and was in “a lot of pain” before his death in 1981. Now facing a terminal diagnosis herself, she made the admission to BBC Radio Oxford as part of an effort to change the law on assisted dying. Police said they were investigating her case. Assisted suicide - intentionally helping another person to end their life - and euthanasia - deliberately ending a person's life - are illegal in England.  Hamish had neuroblastoma, a rare cancer that mostly affects children. He was five when diagnosed and was initially given a prognosis of three months. Following 16 months of ""beastly"" cancer treatment at Great Ormond Street Hospital, his life was extended but he was left in great pain, according to his mother. She said: ""On Hamish's last night, when he said he was in a lot of pain, I said: 'Would you like me to remove the pain?' and he said: 'Yes please, mama.' ""And through his Hickman Catheter, I gave him a large dose of morphine that did quietly end his life."" BBC Radio Oxford asked the 77-year-old if she believed her son knew she was intending to end his life. She replied: ""I feel very strongly that at the point of Hamish telling me he was in pain, and asking me if I could remove his pain, he knew, he knew somewhere what was going to happen. ""But I cannot obviously tell you why or how, but I was his mother, he loved his mother, and I totally loved him, and I was not going to let him suffer, and I feel he really knew where he was going."" She continued: ""It was the right thing to do. My son was facing the most horrendous suffering and intense pain, I was not going to allow him to go through that."" Asked if she understood she was potentially admitting to manslaughter or murder, she replied: ""Yes."" ""If they come 43 years after I have allowed Hamish to die peacefully, then I would have to face the consequences. But they would have to be quick, because I'm dying too,"" she added. Four decades after Hamish's death, his mother is coming to terms with her own incurable cancer. She said his suffering and her own ill health had cemented her feelings on assisted deaths. ""We don't do it to our pets. Why should we do it to humans?"" she said. Campaigners for a so-called ""right to die"" have argued that people should be able to choose when and how to die in order to avoid suffering. Critics have said changing the law would ""place pressure on vulnerable people to end their lives"" for fear of being a financial or emotional burden. MPs recently discussed the issue at a parliamentary debate, at which the government said it was a matter of conscience for individual parliamentarians rather than one for government policy. In a statement, Thames Valley Police said it was ""aware of reports relating to an apparent case of assisted dying of a seven-year-old boy in 1981"". It added: ""At this early stage, the force is making inquiries into these reports and is not in a position to comment further while these investigations continue."" This is a hugely complex and highly controversial subject, and yet it is one that is gaining momentum. Assisted dying is the phrase used to describe a situation where someone who is terminally ill seeks medical help to obtain lethal drugs which they administer themselves. Assisted suicide, is helping another person end their life. Both are illegal in the UK but recently, Scotland, Jersey and the Isle of Man all announced they are considering changing the law to let terminally ill people end their lives. One hundred and ninety cases have been referred to the Crown Prosecution Service over a 15 year period. Most were not taken forward, there have been four successful prosecutions.

Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas was picked as the EU's next foreign affairs chief and former Portuguese Prime Minister António Costa was chosen as the next chairman of EU summits. All three candidates are from centrist, pro-EU factions. The European Parliament is due to vote on the nominations for Ms von der Leyen and Ms Kallas. Ms von der Leyen is from Germany’s centre-right, Mr Costa is a socialist and Ms Kallas a liberal. The leadership package represents continuity for the EU at a time of geopolitical uncertainty. It comes despite a surge in support for hard-right parties in the European Parliament elections earlier this month. But there has been resistance from Italy’s Prime Minister, Giorgia Meloni. Before the summit she said the plans ignored the successes of hard-right parties like her own in the recent elections for the European Parliament. Ms Meloni has worked on cultivating a constructive relationship with the EU political mainstream, but she abstained from the vote for Ms von der Leyen and voted against Mr Costa and Ms Kallas.  Ms Meloni, who heads the right-wing European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) bloc in the European Parliament, was notably not included in talks on the nominations despite the fact that the ECR became the third largest group in the parliament following the European elections. Addressing the Italian parliament on Wednesday, she said angrily that European voters had asked the EU to ""take a different path to the one it has travelled on so far"". Without naming names, she criticised ""those who argue that citizens are not mature enough to take certain decisions, and [who believe] that oligarchy is essentially the only acceptable form of democracy"". Approval from the European Parliament could be a trickier challenge. Ms von der Leyen needs 361 votes in order to be confirmed for a second term. Theoretically, support from the centre-right European People’s Party, liberals and social democrats would give her enough support. But it is a tight margin. Diplomats say Ms von der Leyen may seek to win Ms Meloni's backing by giving Italy a powerful post in the commission. ""I would plain and simply like to express my gratitude to the leaders who endorsed my nomination for second mandate as president of the European Commission,"" said Ms von der Leyen. If she is approved by the European Parliament, one of her main tasks will be to see how Brussels can keep supporting Ukraine in its fight against Russia - something that could be complicated if Donald Trump wins November's presidential election in the US. Ms Kallas is also a strong supporter of Ukraine and a hawkish critic of the Kremlin and Russia’s President Vladimir Putin.  Moscow put her on a list of wanted criminals after her government removed Soviet-era war monuments.  Some critics have expressed concern that her uncompromising stance could be a hindrance in her new role as the EU’s top diplomat - both externally and within the bloc itself. Ms Kallas said she was ""really honoured by the support"" and described the role as an ""enormous responsibility"".  ""My aim is definitely to work for European unity, protect European interests."" Mr Costa praised Ms Kallas and Ms von der Leyen, saying: ""I'm sure our collaboration will be very successful to serve Europe and European citizens.""  ""Europe and the world are facing challenging moments, yes,"" he said after his nomination.  ""But the European Union has demonstrated its resilience in the past, always finding strengths in the unity, and building unity between member states will be my main priority when I take up my position in December focused on putting on track the strategic agenda which European Council has approved today."" Mr Costa, who resigned as prime minister last year, will replace Belgium's former Prime Minister Charles Michel. Ms Kallas will take over from Spain's Josep Borrell."
Hawkish,"Teenager died in sea wall slip, inquest hears",2024-09-25,2024-06-18,John Ayres,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy77wqdw28ro,"A Ukrainian teenager died after slipping off a Devon sea wall while walking in the dark, an inquest has heard. Albina Yevko, 14, was found on a sandy beach between Dawlish and Dawlish Warren. The teenager went for a walk at dusk on 4 March 2023,  but her mother became concerned when she did not return her phone calls, the hearing in Exeter was told.  Her body was found face down on the beach by the seawall, and she was pronounced dead in hospital the next morning, it heard. Miss Yevko came to the UK with her mother Inna in May 2022, fleeing the war with Russia. At the inquest, statements were read out from Inna Yevko, the first responders to the scene, and doctors who treated Albina.  Dr Deborah Cook, the pathologist who examined Albina’s body, said in a statement Miss Yevko had injuries consistent with a fall from a height. The police officer leading the investigation, Det Insp Becky Davies, of Devon and Cornwall Police, said via video link that there was no evidence of third party involvement.   She said Miss Yevko did not deliberately jump from the wall to end her life. Ms Davies said there was no barrier to stop anyone coming off the sea wall and no marking to show people the edge of it, as well as no lighting. Coroner Alison Longhorn concluded it was an accidental death, and said she would be filing a Prevention of Further Death Report.  She said: ""Not only should Network Rail consider carefully actions to reduce the risk of death, they should also do so with some degree of urgency."" She offered her sincere condolences to Albina's mother, family and friends. Follow BBC Devon on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram. Send your story ideas to spotlight@bbc.co.uk."
Hawkish,Gunmen and getaway driver jailed after shooting,2024-09-25,2024-06-17,Alex McIntyre,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgll6zkv2y6o,"Three men have been jailed after a shooting in Stoke-on-Trent left a man with serious leg injuries. Stephen Thorogood, Jesse Dyche and Ethan Beech all received prison terms for their role in the attack on Dawlish Drive, Bentilee, on 30 August. The trio from Stoke-on-Trent were caught on CCTV driving in a Ford Focus before changing into black clothing and getting into a stolen Vauxhall Insignia, police said. They drove to Dawlish Drive where the victim was shot in the street, suffering lower leg bone fractures. Staffordshire Police said Thorogood, 45, and Dyche, 27, were on foot at the time of the incident, while Beech, 19, was waiting in the Vauxhall nearby. The trio drove off in the car before abandoning it and leaving in the Ford Focus. Dyche was stopped while driving in the same Ford Focus in north Wales the next day and police found a hammer, crowbar, balaclava, passports, a baseball bat and £2,200 in cash inside the vehicle. Thorogood and Beech were arrested later and all three were charged in relation to the shooting. The gun was never recovered. At Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court on Friday, Dyche, of Leek Road, and Thorogood, of Chelmsford Road, both pleaded guilty to causing grievous bodily harm with intent and possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life. They were both sentenced to nine years in prison.  Beech, of Fell Street, admitted assisting an offender and was jailed for 20 months. Follow BBC Stoke & Staffordshire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

They were among six teenagers who got stuck on the Exe Estuary at about 17:00 BST on Sunday. They had all tried to swim from Mamhead Slipway to Dawlish Warren when they got into trouble, said Exmouth RNLI. ""Two were unable to make it across and clinging to a buoy in the river, with the remaining four making it to Pole Sands, where they were then stuck by the rising tide,"" said the crew. The Exmouth lifeboat pulled the first two casualties from the water before retrieving the remaining four teenagers from Pole Sands and brought them back to a slipway. Coastguards from Dawlish and south Devon had been training nearby and, along with two off-duty RNLI crew, they raised the alarm. Exmouth RNLI said: ""Their close proximity to the location of the incident no doubt helped with the very fast response time of our lifeboat. ""The River Exe has very strong and potentially dangerous currents and is also a very busy boating channel.   ""Attempting to swim across it at any time is dangerous.

Hawkish,Harbour patrols stop 26 speeding vessels since March,2024-09-25,2024-06-11,Guy Henderson,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy99q0qp71zo,"More than 20 speeding vessels have been stopped by patrols in the Exe Estuary since March, a report has revealed. Boat and personal watercraft owners were said to be speeding close to wildlife refuges and some had refused to stop when challenged by harbour patrols. The scale of the speeding is outlined in a report to Exeter City Council by harbourmaster Grahame Forshaw. Mr Forshaw's report said he was receiving information ""daily about vessels travelling at excessive speed"". His report said since the last meeting of the council’s harbour board in March a patrol boat had been on the water every weekend, weather permitting, and 26 vessels were stopped and their owners spoken to. The number is slightly down on the same period last year, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said. Mr Forshaw’s report added: “The patrol boat can only be in one place at a time. “We receive reports daily about vessels travelling at excessive speed.  ""In fact when we are afloat working from our other boats, we see craft going too fast in the river, often in areas where there are moorings or close to the designated wildlife refuge areas. “We have had occasions when skippers of vessels travelling too fast have refused to stop when requested to by the harbour patrol.” The report also said since March two broken-down vessels had been towed back to their moorings; one yacht sank on its mooring; a rowing boat and a powerboat collided and two yachts grounded on Pole Sands between Dawlish Warren and Exmouth. A navigation buoy also broke free from its anchor and drifted five miles out to sea before being recovered off Lyme Regis, the Local Democracy Reporting Service added.

Hawkish,Confident Putin warns Europe is ‘defenceless’,2024-09-25,2024-06-07,Steve Rosenberg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn00e422yr2o,"Ever since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Moscow has been engaged in nuclear sabre-rattling, dropping a series of not-so-subtle hints that trying to defeat a nuclear power like Russia could have disastrous consequences for those who try. Today President Putin claimed that Russia wouldn’t need to use a nuclear weapon to achieve victory in Ukraine. He was being interviewed at a panel discussion at the St Petersburg International Economic Forum: the annual event often described as ‘Russia’s Davos’. There are few occasions when Mr Putin looks dovish compared to the person asking him the questions. But when the person asking the questions is Sergei Karaganov it would be hard not to. Mr Karaganov is a hawkish Russian foreign policy expert. Last year he called for a pre-emptive nuclear strike. Today he suggested holding a “nuclear pistol” to the temple of the West over Ukraine. President Putin wasn’t so extreme in his language. But he is no dove. The Kremlin leader said he did not rule out changes to Russia’s nuclear doctrine: the document which sets out the conditions under which Russia would use nuclear weapons. “This doctrine is a living tool and we are carefully watching what is happening in the world around us and do not exclude making changes to this doctrine. This is also related to the testing of nuclear weapons.” And he delivered a warning to those European countries who’ve been supporting Ukraine: Russia has “many more [tactical nuclear weapons] than there are on the European continent, even if the United States brings theirs over.” “Europe does not have a developed [early warning system],” he added. “In this sense they are more or less defenceless.” Tactical nuclear weapons are smaller warheads designed to destroy targets without widespread radioactive fallout. This has been a surreal week in St Petersburg. On the one hand, a huge international economic forum has been taking place , sending the message that Russia is ready for cooperation and that, despite everything, it’s business as usual. Clearly, though, it is not business as usual.  Russia is waging war in Ukraine, a war which is now in its third year; as a result, Russia is the most heavily sanctioned country in the world. And, right now, tensions are soaring between Russia and the West. Earlier this week, at a meeting with international news agency chiefs in St Petersburg, President Putin suggested that Russia might supply advanced conventional long-range weapons to others to strike Western targets.  This was his response to Nato allies allowing Ukraine to strike Russian territory with Western-supplied weapons. He repeated the idea again today. “We are not supplying those weapons yet, but we reserve the right to do so to those states or legal entities which are under certain pressure, including military pressure, from the countries that supply weapons to Ukraine and encourage their use on Russian territory.” There were no details. No names. So, to which parts of the world might Russia deploy its missiles? “Wherever we think it is necessary, we’re definitely going to put them. As President Putin made clear, we’ll investigate this question,” Vladimir Solovyov, one of Russian state TV’s most prominent hosts, tells me. “If you are trying to harm us you have to be pretty sure we have enough opportunities and chances to harm you.” “In the West some will say we’ve heard this sabre-rattling before,” I respond, “and that it’s a bluff.” “It’s always a bluff. Until the time when it is not,” Mr Solovyov replies. “You can keep thinking that Russia is bluffing and then, one day, there is no more Great Britain to laugh at. Don’t you ever try to push the Russian bear thinking that ‘Oh, it’s a kitten, we can play with it.” CEOs from Europe and America used to flock to the St Petersburg International Economic Forum. Not any more. Instead I saw delegations from Asia, Africa, the Middle East and South America. Russia has been using this year’s event to try to show that, despite Western sanctions, there are plenty of countries in the world who are ready to do business with Russia. And what have we learnt in St Petersburg about Vladimir Putin? That he sounds increasingly confident and determined not to back down. He seems to believe that in the current standoff between Russia and the West, it is the West that will blink first."
Hawkish,"We have no Plan B if Ukraine falls, says Estonia",2024-09-25,2024-05-31,Frank Gardner,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c722zxj0kyro,"Estonia considers itself a front-line state, a Nato member where its border guards stare across the Narva River at the Russian fortress of Ivangorod.  This tiny Baltic state, once a part of the Soviet Union, is convinced that once the fighting stops in Ukraine, President Vladimir Putin will turn his attention to the Baltics, looking to bring countries like Estonia back under Moscow’s control. To help stave off that possibility, Estonia’s government has poured money and weapons into Ukraine’s war effort, donating more than 1% of its GDP to Kyiv.  ""If every Nato country did this,"" says Estonia’s steely Prime Minister Kaja Kallas, ""Ukraine would win."" But Ukraine isn’t winning. Short of artillery, ammunition, air defences and most of all, troops, Ukraine is struggling to hold back the sheer weight of Russian firepower, glide bombs and massed infantry assaults that often border on the suicidal. What, I asked Prime Minister Kallas, is Estonia’s Plan B if Ukraine loses this war and Russia’s invasion ultimately succeeds? ""We have no Plan B for a Russian victory,"" she replies, ""because then we would stop focussing on Plan A"" - helping Ukraine push back the Russian invasion.  ""We should not give in to pessimism. Victory in Ukraine is not just about territory. If Ukraine joins Nato, even without some territory, then that’s a victory because it will be placed under the Nato umbrella."" Kaja Kallas is controversial. She is not the first national leader to be more popular outside their country than within.  Born a Soviet citizen, her mother and grandmother were forcibly deported to Siberia.  Now 46 and prime minister since 2021, she is one of the most hawkish leaders in Nato when it comes to blunting the Kremlin’s ambitions in Europe. That has spooked some in the White House that she risks dragging the West into direct conflict with Moscow.  Many Estonians are also less than happy at taxes being raised to pay for their contribution to Ukraine’s defence. But Kaja Kallas wants the West to wake up to what she sees as an existential threat from a newly aggressive Russia. ""Russia wants to sow fear in our societies,"" she tells us, sitting in the cabinet office in Estonia’s equivalent of 10 Downing Street, overlooking the soaring spires and ancient castle walls of Tallinn’s Old Town.  ""We see different hybrid attacks in many parts of the EU."" ""Hybrid attacks"", also known as ""sub-threshhold"" or ""grey zone"" warfare, are hostile actions suspected of being carried out by an adversary such as Russia where no shots are necessarily fired, no-one is killed and blame is often hard to pin - yet the damage can be extensive.  An example, still unsolved, would be the mysterious underwater explosions that blew up the Nordstream gas pipelines beneath the Baltic Sea in 2022. Another example is the recent allegation of Russian electronic interference in flights passing close to its exclave of Kaliningrad on the Baltic coast. In its latest annual report, Estonia’s internal security service Kapo quotes the example of last autumn when hundreds of schools in Estonia and other Baltic states were sent emails claiming bombs had been placed in school buildings.  ""Such threats,"" says the report, ""aim to create psychological and emotional tension by targeting the most vulnerable – threatening the safety of children"". So just how vulnerable is Estonia to a future Russian invasion? ""We have to prepare for war so that we don’t have one,"" says one Nato officer, speaking on the sidelines of Nato’s Exercise Steadfast Defender.  Down on Estonia’s southern border with Latvia, ageing British Challenger 2 tanks and other 1980s-era armoured vehicles lurch over farmland, belching exhaust fumes into the clear spring air. Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 was something of a wake-up call for the Western alliance. It made Nato chiefs realise that they needed to significantly beef up their military presence on Europe’s eastern flank if they are to deter any future Russian invasion. Today the UK leads a 1,200-strong battle group based in Tapa, northern Estonia, and composed of tanks, infantry, artillery, drones and a company of France's elite mountain infantry. ""The key part of this strategy of denial,"" says Brigadier Giles Harris, who commands UK forces here, ""is to make sure we have enough forces built up in time to create more of a deterrence"". I point out that 1,200 troops does not sound like a lot when the one big lesson from the current conflict in Ukraine is that mass matters. Russia may have poor tactics and equipment but it can field such vastly superior numbers of men and ammunition that it is often able to overwhelm Ukraine’s defences. ""Your observations that one battle group isn’t enough would be a fair one a few years ago,"" he replies. ""But our new plans see us reinforcing at brigade scale [3,000-5,000 troops] in advance of even a short, small-scale incursion [by Russia].""  ""We have a formation at high readiness in the UK... to get heavier forces here in time... and it’s a complete step change from where we were before."" The British forces based in Tapa, and their Estonian partners, are keeping a close eye on what’s happening in Ukraine. ""It’s a window into the tactical deployment of Russian troops,"" says Brig Harris. ""We now see our training here in Estonia far more as a mission rehearsal specifically to fight the enemy we see playing out in the south [Ukraine]."" So ultimately, I ask him, given the setbacks Ukraine is currently experiencing, largely due to a shortage of ammunition and manpower, is Britain’s commander here confident that a Russian incursion into Estonia would be repelled successfully? ""Absolutely,"" he replies, without hesitation. ""More so now than ever before."""
Hawkish,Why has Putin removed key ally as defence minister?,2024-09-25,2024-05-13,By Steve Rosenberg,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-69006046,"A few thoughts about Russian reshuffles. Thought number one: whoever's sitting around the cabinet table in Russia, there's only one man taking the key decisions in the country - and that's President Putin.  In modern Russia the entire political system is constructed around him. It's worth keeping in mind when discussing who's in and who's out of the government. Central policy is unlikely to change.  Does that mean that a Russian government reshuffle isn't interesting, or significant? No, it doesn't. Sergei Shoigu's departure from the defence ministry is fascinating on many levels.  After all - and this brings us on to thought number two - reshuffles are a rare thing in Russia. At least, as far as the most prominent political players are concerned. Take Sergei Lavrov, Russia's veteran foreign minister. He's had the job for 20 years. Sergei Shoigu had been defence minister for 12 years (in that time, the UK has been through six secretaries of defence). Mr Shoigu is considered a close ally of President Putin. Cue to thought number three: being close to Putin, going on fishing and hunting trips with the president (yes, Sergei Shoigu did that - they even, famously, went mushroom-picking together), none of that is any guarantee you'll keep your job. Sergei Shoigu has been replaced as defence minister by technocrat economist Andrei Belousov. Mr Shoigu hasn't been made redundant. He'll head the Russian Security Council in place of the hawkish Nikolai Patrushev.  But it doesn't feel like a promotion.  So why has a Putin loyalist been moved out of the defence ministry? Why has an economist replaced him? And what does this tell us about Vladimir Putin? It's not a complete surprise. Rumours abounded that Sergei Shoigu could be sidelined. One of his deputies, Timur Ivanov, was recently arrested on corruption charges.  What's more, replacing Mr Shoigu with an economist makes sense, when you consider the huge amount of money the authorities have been pouring into Russia's war in Ukraine. Defence spending in Russia has been ratcheted up to an estimated 7% of GDP. Increasingly it feels as if the Russian economy is being placed on a war footing.  There is a logic to having a defence minister who understands finances, economic planning and the need for efficiency - someone, too, unconnected to allegations of corruption currently under investigation.  But what's interesting is that Vladimir Putin chose this moment to make the switch. The president had stuck by Shoigu in 2022 when Russia was suffering military setbacks in Ukraine. He'd stuck by him again in 2023 during the minister's very public spat with the late Wagner mercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin, who had accused Shoigu of corruption and demanded he be sacked. Now, when Russia claims to have seized the initiative on the battlefield, the Kremlin leader has replaced his defence minister. It shows once again that Vladimir Putin doesn't like acting under pressure. He takes decisions at a time of his choosing.   But there is one more feature of a Russian government reshuffle. It always leaves you asking questions. There are plenty after this one.  So here we go. What next for Sergei Shoigu? Can he carve out a new power base in the Security Council, or is it inevitable that in his new post his power will be vastly reduced?   What next for the man he replaces in the Security Council, Nikolai Patrushev? For a long time considered one of the most powerful men in Russia, will Mr Patrushev retain his influence? And in what guise? Does the appointment of a new defence minister mean that, at some point soon, there'll be a new chief of the general staff in place of Valery Gerasimov? Watch this space."

Dartmouth Open Air Pool is one of 20 in the South West, and 325 in England, to receive a share of a £60m government grant. The government said the funding aimed to secure the long-term future of public swimming pools. The facility was granted £48,000 for solar panels and pool covers.  Jo Squires, treasurer and pool manager, said: ""Once the solar panels and covers are installed and all in working order, it will help to reduce our astronomic electricity bill, which was £33,000 for just the four months we are open.  ""Without this money we would have to remain closed until the electricity prices came back down again."" She said they were ""slowly modernising"" the 37-year-old pool, adding: ""If it had to close it would be a loss to the locals who love it, as it provides a completely different swimming experience to the indoor pool."" Among other pools to benefit from the Government and Sport England funding was Quayside Leisure Centre in Kingsbridge, handed £77,000 for variable speed pumps and a building management system upgrade.  Parklands Leisure Centre in Okehampton said it would use £38,500 for pool covers and a variable speed filtration system, it said. Councillor Tony Leech of West Devon Council, which runs the Okehampton centre, said it followed ""hard times"" amid rising energy costs, and the cash would help ensure the future of the ""vitally important community facility"". ""Our leisure centres bring people together, help people improve their physical and mental health and are hugely important to community wellbeing,"" he added. Sports Minister Stuart Andrew said millions of people swim every year in England but some pools were struggling financially.  He said the funding had helped more than 300 facilities, with interventions including LED lights and solar power panels.  Other pools to benefit include Exe Valley Leisure Centre in Tiverton (£375,000), Dawlish Leisure Centre (£168,000) and St Ives Leisure Centre (£156,000).

Hawkish,Russia defiant over new US aid to Ukraine,2024-09-25,2024-04-22,By Steve Rosenberg,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68874019,"A good rule of thumb since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine has been that what is good for Kyiv is bad for Moscow. Last Saturday brought good news for the Ukrainian government. The US House of Representatives voted in favour of a $61bn (£49bn) aid package for Kyiv, which will be used to arm its military.  The House also approved a bill that will allow the seizure and transfer to Ukraine of Russian assets frozen in America. The bills now move to the Senate for approval. Unsurprisingly, this did not go down well in Moscow.  Hawkish former President Dmitry Medvedev condemned the ""61 billion bloody dollars"". He called for a new American Civil War that ""would finally lead to the inglorious break up of the 21st Century's evil empire, the United States of America"". On his flagship Sunday night state TV talk show, presenter Vladimir Solovyov described the idea of transferring Russian assets to Ukraine as ""an act of financial terrorism"". ""If they go through with this,"" Mr Solovyov said, ""then on the level of the State Duma and the government, we must declare America a financial terrorist."" He added that he now believes war between Russia and Nato is ""inevitable"". Talk of ""evil empires"" and ""inevitable wars"" is dramatic.  But, in the main, Russia's reaction to events in Congress is best summed up by the phrase Keep Calm and Carry On.  While fiercely critical of additional US aid to Kyiv, Russian officials and the state media have been playing down its potential consequences, with a series of key messages in the media. ""We had fully expected this,"" said Vladimir Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Monday, when asked about the president's reaction to the US aid package. The same claim appeared in Monday's edition of the Russian government newspaper, Rossiyskaya Gazeta, which declared: ""Such an outcome of the vote on assistance to Ukraine had been expected"". Meanwhile, ""US aid won't change the situation on the battlefield"" is the headline in the latest edition of the pro-Kremlin Izvestia newspaper.  Mr Peskov delivered the same message almost word-for-word. ""It won't change the situation on the battlefield in any significant way,"" he told journalists.  ""The Russian armed forces are improving their positions in the Special Military Operation [Russia's war in Ukraine].  ""The money being provided, the weapons which will be supplied for this money, they will not change the dynamic. More Ukrainians will be killed."" Russian officials and pro-Kremlin media claim that, by continuing to support Ukraine, the US is ""getting dragged into"" a war it will lose.  Monday's Izvestia asked: ""Off the top of their heads, can anyone name one major conflict from which the Americans emerged undisputed victors? Vietnam? Iraq? Afghanistan?"" ""Sometimes it seems strange that Washington is constantly being dragged into military escapades which end in failure one after another,"" it continued.  Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova added: ""Washington is sinking deeper into this hybrid war against Russia. It will end in a loud and humiliating fiasco for America, like Vietnam and Afghanistan."" Moscow's messaging is clear: there is no panic. But there is concern. The aid package can help Ukraine and hurt Russia.  Monday's edition of daily newspaper Moskovsky Komsomolets predicts Ukrainian strikes in the near future, ""deep into [Russian] territory. But, most likely, on Crimea. And, of course, on the Crimean bridge"". That bridge, linking the Russian mainland to the annexed Crimean peninsula, is a key target for Ukraine and has been attacked before. There is concern, too, at the prospect of Russian assets abroad being handed over to Ukraine. The vast majority of frozen Russian funds are in the EU, not America. But Moscow will not want to see the US set a precedent that Europe could follow. "
Hawkish,Bridge in place for link road project,2024-09-25,2024-04-18,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgxw9zk7ez4o,"A bridge which is part of a £6.2m link road project has been put into place. Teignbridge District Council said a crane lifted the bridge's deck into its final position over Shutterton Brook near Secmaton Lane in Dawlish. The bridge is part of a scheme for a new link road connecting a 860-home housing development to the A379. The council said in a Facebook post the link road scheme was on track to be completed in the summer. The council said the road would help traffic avoid having to use Elm Grove Road and going past two schools. The authority added the bridge and link road were a big part of plans to connect the new homes to the A379. In a statement, the council said: ""The link road, which is supported by local people, will provide a bus route, cycling lanes and footpaths, boosting more sustainable transport options. ""We have worked with Natural England and the Environment Agency to ensure all wildlife in the area has been safeguarded and we have used many environmentally sustainable processes throughout the build.""

Hawkish,Russia plans prolonged drone attacks - Zelensky,2024-09-25,2023-01-02,By Matt Murphy,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-64146813,"Ukraine's president says Russia is planning a protracted campaign of drone attacks in a bid to demoralise Ukraine.  Volodymyr Zelensky said he had received intelligence reports suggesting that Moscow would launch the attacks using Iranian-made Shahed drones.  It comes after Ukraine carried out a strike that it said killed hundreds of Russian soldiers in the Donbas region. In an extremely rare admission of battlefield losses, Russia said the attack killed 63 of its troops.  Speaking from Kyiv in his nightly address, Mr Zelensky said Russia planned to ""exhaust"" Ukraine with a prolonged wave of drone attacks. ""We must ensure - and we will do everything for this - that this goal of terrorists fails like all the others,"" he said. ""Now is the time when everyone involved in the protection of the sky should be especially attentive."" Russian drone strikes on Ukraine appear to have increased in recent days, with Moscow launching attacks on cities and power stations across the country over the past three nights.  Correspondents say that as well as the strain on Ukraine's military - which has to track and intercept the drones - there is also an attritional impact on the civilian population which lives with the uncertainty, fear and disruption the attacks cause across the country. Russia has been targeting Ukraine's energy infrastructure for several months, destroying power stations and plunging millions into darkness during the country's freezing winter. Mr Zelensky said Ukrainian air defences had already shot down over 80 Iranian-made drones in the opening days of 2023.  Elsewhere, Ukraine has confirmed it carried out a strike in the occupied region of Donetsk, which it earlier claimed killed 400 Russian troops. Russian officials contested the figure, saying only 63 troops were killed. Neither claim has been verified, and access to the site is restricted.  However, some of those killed and wounded came from Russia's south-western Samara region, according to governor Dmitry Azarov, who urged families to contact a hotline or local military offices. Families laid wreaths in the region's main cities of Samara and Tolyatti on Tuesday to remember those killed. The Ukrainian attack, thought to have taken place as Russians celebrated the new year, hit a vocational school building in the city of Makiivka, where Russian soldiers were stationed. It is extremely rare for Moscow to confirm any battlefield casualties.  But this was such a deadly attack, says the BBC's Russia editor Steve Rosenberg, that staying silent probably wasn't an option. It is the highest number of deaths acknowledged by Moscow in a single incident since the war began 10 months ago.  In a statement on Monday, Russia's defence ministry said Ukrainian forces fired six rockets using the US-made Himars rocket system at a building housing Russian troops. Two of them were shot down, it added.  Igor Girkin, a Russian nationalist commentator, earlier said that hundreds had been killed and wounded, although the exact number was unknown because of the large number still missing.  The building itself was ""almost completely destroyed"", he said. He added that the victims were mainly mobilised troops - that is, recent conscripts, rather than those who chose to fight. He also said ammunition was stored in the same building as the soldiers, making the damage worse. ""Almost all of the military equipment was also destroyed, which stood right next to the building without any disguise whatsoever,"" he wrote on Telegram.  Girkin is a well-known military blogger, who led Russian-backed separatists when they occupied of large parts of eastern Ukraine in 2014. He was recently found guilty of murder for his part in the shooting down of flight MH17.  Despite his hawkish stance, he regularly criticises the Russian military leadership and their tactics. Several Russian lawmakers have also strongly criticised military commanders over the attack, saying commanders must be held to account for allowing troops to concentrate in an unprotected building within range of Ukrainian rockets, where ammunition may also have been stored.  Sergei Mironov - a former chairman of the Russian Senate - said it was obvious than neither intelligence nor air defence had worked properly.  According to the Ukrainian military's earlier statement, 300 were wounded in addition to the estimated 400 killed. Ukraine's army claims, almost daily, to have killed dozens, sometimes hundreds, of soldiers in attacks.  A later statement from the Ukrainian military's general staff said ""up to 10 units of enemy military equipment"" were ""destroyed and damaged"" in the strikes, and that ""the losses of personnel of the occupiers are being specified"". The US-based Institute for the Study of War said the defence ministry in Moscow was probably trying to deflect the blame for the security lapse on to Russia's proxy authorities in Donetsk.  Local security officials told Tass news agency that the cause of the strike was that Ukrainian forces had been able to detect the use of Russian mobile phones by servicemen arriving in the building."
Hawkish,"All the Doctors, from Hartnell to Whittaker",2024-09-25,2017-07-16,By Neil Smith,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-40585673,"Doctor Who's Peter Capaldi has passed on his sonic screwdriver to Jodie Whittaker who becomes the 13th doctor and first woman to take on the role of television's famous Time Lord. She follows a distinguished line-up of thespian (male) talent that stretches all the way back to the sci-fi favourite's first episode in 1963. William Hartnell was the first actor to play the Doctor on television, appearing in the BBC show from 1963 to 1966. Hartnell, who died in 1975, had previously appeared in TV's The Army Game and Carry On Sergeant, the first Carry On film, in 1958. While Hartnell was playing the Doctor on television, Peter Cushing could be found playing him on film in Dr Who and the Daleks, in which Roy Castle co-starred. That 1965 film and its 1966 follow-up, Daleks - Invasion Earth: 2150 A.D., depicted the Doctor as a human scientist rather than a time-travelling Gallifreyan and are not considered part of the Doctor Who timeline. When ill health forced Hartnell to relinquish the role, the Doctor regenerated - for the first time - into Patrick Troughton. Memorably scruffy and eccentric, Troughton spent three years travelling time and space before stepping down in 1969. When the raffish Jon Pertwee became the third Doctor, he also became the first to be seen on television in colour. His tenure, which ran from 1970 to 1974, saw the Time Lord exiled to Earth and working with Unit, aka the United Nations Intelligence Taskforce. Pertwee's time with the show also saw the first of the popular ensemble stories in which previous Doctors appear alongside the current one. Broadcast over December 1972 and January 1973, The Three Doctors saw him joined by Patrick Troughton and William Hartnell in what would be the latter's final acting engagement. When Pertwee moved on in 1974, Tom Baker moved in - and would become the longest-serving Doctor to date. Deep-voiced, curly-haired and eternally long of scarf, his seven years in the Tardis earned him legions of fans who were delighted anew in 2013 when he popped up at the end of a 50th anniversary special. When Baker finally stepped down from the role in 1981, his shoes were filled by the fresh-faced Peter Davison. The boyish actor spent three years as the Fifth Doctor before taking his leave at the end of the show's 21st series. Davison's tenure coincided with Doctor Who's 20th anniversary, celebrated by a feature-length special that saw him joined by Jon Pertwee and Patrick Troughton. The First Doctor also made an appearance, with Richard Hurndall filling in for the late William Hartnell. Tom Baker opted not to return for The Five Doctors, which covered over his absence by incorporating material from one of the actor's unbroadcast adventures. Similar subterfuge was required for this 1983 photo shoot, which saw Hurndall, Davison, Pertwee and Troughton joined by an unconvincing Baker mannequin. Davison's departure opened the door for another Baker to take controls of the Doctor's time-travelling police box in 1984. Colin Baker (no relation of Tom's) spent less than three years in the role, with his appearances limited further by an 18-month hiatus in production. Though Baker had limited time to enjoy the Tardis, he did get the chance to meet one of his predecessors when Patrick Troughton returned - for the third time - in 1985. The Two Doctors marked Troughton's final reprise of his signature role. Some years later, his sons David and Michael would both make Doctor Who appearances. Scottish actor Sylvester McCoy took over from Colin Baker in 1987 and played the Doctor until the show's axing in 1989. Michael Grade - the controller of BBC One at the time - was no fan of the programme, which was looking increasingly threadbare and cheap-looking in the face of glossier cinema fare. Some feel, though, that this period in the show's evolution has been harshly judged. An attempt was made to revive Doctor Who in 1996 with a TV film that saw McCoy regenerate into Paul McGann on American soil. It was hoped the special would spawn a TV series but it never materialised, making McGann's tenure the shortest of all the Doctors. In 2005 Doctor Who regenerated into the ambitious, well-financed property it is today. It also introduced a new Doctor in the form of Christopher Eccleston. To the disappointment of many, the Salford-born actor chose to make only one series of the rebooted show. His departure was confirmed only days after his debut episode was broadcast. Eccleston's exit saw David Tennant join the show, with his first full episode - The Christmas Invasion - shown on BBC One on Christmas Day 2005. Tennant's amiable style and enthusiasm made him a popular choice for the role, which he finally relinquished on the first day of 2010. The spate of junior Doctors continued with the casting of Matt Smith, who was just 27 when he made his debut as the Time Lord's 11th incarnation. His four years in the role, which coincided with Doctor Who's 50th anniversary, saw the programme both maintain and bolster its renewed popularity. Doctor Who's 50th anniversary in 2013 was marked by The Day of the Doctor, a feature-length special in which Matt Smith's Time Lord was joined by David Tennant's version of the character. The Day of the Doctor also introduced a previously unknown incarnation of the Doctor, known as The War Doctor and played by Sir John Hurt. The character rejected referring to himself as 'The Doctor' and is not considered to have the same status as his fellow TV Time Lords. Peter Capaldi was no stranger to the Doctor Who universe when he was cast as the Doctor in 2013. A lifelong fan of the show, he appeared in an episode of the programme in 2008 and also had a role in its spin-off Torchwood. His hawkish features brought a new intensity, and maturity, to the Tardis from the moment his first full episode was broadcast in August 2014. Capaldi's most recent adventure saw him briefly joined by the ""original"" Doctor, played on this occasion by David Bradley. Bradley will return in this year's Doctor Who Christmas special. Bradley's appearance was a pleasing one for Whovians after his role as William Hartnell in An Adventure in Space and Time, a 2013 dramatisation of the show's early years. Jodie Whittaker has been named as the 13th Doctor and will be the first woman to play the role - if one discounts Joanna Lumley, who briefly played the Doctor in a 1999 Comic Relief sketch. Whittaker will make her debut on the sci-fi show this Christmas when Peter Capaldi regenerates. Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

Hawkish,Kitesurfer dies as high winds batter UK,2024-09-25,2019-02-09,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-47185752,"A kitesurfer has died after getting into difficulty in high winds on a beach in north Devon as Storm Erik battered the UK for a second day. It came after two men died in separate incidents on the roads in Devon and in Wales on Friday, the latter due to a falling tree. The weather has caused widespread delays and disruption to transport.  Gusts of up to 75mph were recorded in western parts of the UK and motorists advised to take care.  A 50-year-old man died on the A384 in Buckfastleigh, Devon and a van driver was killed after colliding with a fallen tree on the B4306 between Pontyberem and Llannon in west Wales. High winds of 40 and 50mph were typical across the country. The highest winds were recorded in Powys at 75mph, while winds in Dumfries and Galloway reached 74mph. The storm was dubbed Storm Erik by the Irish weather service Met Éireann where it caused winds of approaching 100mph. A Met Office yellow weather warning for high winds has now been lifted. Winds are expected to die down late on Saturday, with the weather turning wet. A fallen tree caused the A548 to close in both directions around Mostyn, north Wales, and there were lane and speed restrictions on road bridges such as the Dartford Crossing and the Severn Bridge. The A20 near Dover was closed while a CCTV mast that was seen swaying in the wind above the road was repaired. On the trains, speed restrictions of 80mph were imposed on the London North Eastern Railway between Leeds and York and on trains on the Tyne Valley line between Newcastle and Carlisle, according to rail operator Northern."
Hawkish,US-China contagion: The battle behind the scenes,2024-09-25,2020-03-24,By Jonathan Marcus,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-52008453,"It is clearly not a good time for the world and it is not a good time for relations between the US and China. President Donald Trump has repeatedly chosen to call the coronavirus the ""Chinese virus"". His hawkish Secretary of State Mike Pompeo calls it the ""Wuhan virus"", something that causes huge offence in Beijing.  The president and secretary of state have both denounced China for its failings in the initial handling of the outbreak. But Chinese spokesmen have utterly rejected any idea that they were less than transparent about what was going on. Meanwhile, social media in China has spread stories that the pandemic has been caused by a US military germ warfare programme; rumours that gained considerable traction. Scientists have demonstrated that the virus structure is entirely natural in origin.   But this is not just a war of words, something more fundamental is going on. Earlier this month, when the US announced that it was closing its borders to travellers from many EU countries, including Italy, the Chinese government announced that it was sending medical teams and supplies to Italy, the country at the leading edge of the coronavirus pandemic. It has sent help to Iran and Serbia too.  It was a moment of huge symbolism. And it was an indication of the information battle that is being waged behind the scenes, with China eager to emerge from this crisis with renewed status as a global player. Indeed, it is a battle which the US - at the moment - is losing hands down. And the belated despatch of a small mobile US Air Force medical facility to Italy is hardly going to alter the equation. This is a moment when the administrative and political systems of all countries are being stress-tested like never before. Leadership will be at a premium. Existing political leaders will ultimately be judged by how they seized the moment; the clarity of their discourse; and the efficiency with which they marshalled their countries' resources to respond to the pandemic. The pandemic has hit at a time when US-China relations were already at a low ebb. A partial trade deal has barely plastered over the commercial tensions between the two countries.  Both China and the US are re-arming, openly preparing for a potential future conflict in the Asia-Pacific. China has already emerged, at least in regional terms, as a military super-power in its own right. And China now is eager for the wider status that it believes its international position requires.  The pandemic then threatens to pitch US-China relations into an even more difficult period. This could have an important bearing upon both the course of this crisis and the world that emerges from it. When the virus is defeated, China's economic resurgence is going to play a critical role in helping to rebuild the shattered global economy. But for now, Chinese assistance is essential in combating the coronavirus. Medical data and experiences need to continue to be shared. China is also a huge manufacturer of medical equipment and disposable items like masks and protective suits, essential to handling infected patients and items that are required in astronomical numbers. China is in many ways the medical manufacturing workshop of the world, capable of expanding production in ways few other countries can. China is seizing an opportunity but, according to many of President Trump's critics, it is he who has dropped the ball.  The Trump administration initially failed to accept the seriousness of this crisis, seeing it as another opportunity to assert ""America First"" and the supposed superiority of its system. But what is at stake now is global leadership.  As two Asia experts, Kurt M Campbell - who served as assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs in the Obama administration - and Rush Doshi, note in a recent article for Foreign Affairs: ""The status of the United States as a global leader over the past seven decades has been built not just on wealth and power but also, and just as important, on the legitimacy that  flows from the United States' domestic governance, provision of global public goods, and ability and willingness to muster and coordinate a global response to crises."" The coronavirus pandemic, they say, ""is testing all three elements of US leadership. So far, Washington is failing the test. As Washington falters, Beijing is moving quickly and adeptly to take advantage of the opening created by US mistakes, filling the vacuum to present itself as the global leader in pandemic response.""  It is easy to be cynical. Many might wonder how China could seek advantage at this time - Campbell and Doshi call it ""Chutzpah"" - given that it is in China that this pandemic appears to have originated. Beijing's initial response to the developing crisis in Wuhan was secretive. However, since then, it has marshalled its vast resources effectively and impressively. As Suzanne Nossel, the CEO of the press freedom organisation PEN America, writes in an article on the Foreign Policy website: ""Fearful that the initial denial and mismanagement of the outbreak could trigger social unrest, Beijing has now mounted an aggressive domestic and global propaganda campaign to tout its draconian approach to the epidemic, downplay its role in sparking the global outbreak, and contrast its efforts favourably against those of Western governments and particularly the United States."" Many western commentators see China becoming more authoritarian and more nationalist and fear that these trends will be accelerated by the impact of the pandemic and the resulting economic slowdown. But the impact upon Washington's global standing could be even greater. America's allies are taking note. They may not criticise the Trump administration openly, but many have clear differences with it over attitudes to China; the security of Chinese technology (the Huawei controversy); and over Iran and other regional issues. China is using its outreach on the pandemic to try to establish the parameters for a different relationship in the future - one perhaps where China fast becomes the ""essential power"". Link-ups in the counter-coronavirus campaign with its near neighbours - Japan and South Korea - and the provision of vital health equipment to the EU, can be seen in this light.  Campbell and Doshi, in their Foreign Affairs piece, make an explicit comparison with Britain's decline. They say that the botched British operation in 1956 to seize the Suez Canal ""laid bare the decay in British power and marked the end of the United Kingdom's reign as a global power"".  ""Today,"" they say, ""US policymakers should recognize that if the United States does not rise to meet the moment, the coronavirus pandemic could mark another 'Suez moment'."" "

Hawkish,Trump hails CIA chief's secret mission,2024-09-25,2018-04-18,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-43811374,"CIA director Mike Pompeo forged a ""good relationship"" with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un when they met last week, US President Donald Trump has tweeted. Confirming media reports of the secret meeting in Pyongyang, Mr Trump said it had gone ""very smoothly"". The surprise visit marks the highest-level contact between the United States and North Korea since 2000.  Mr Trump is expected to hold a summit with Mr Kim by June. Details are being worked out, the US president said. South Korea has also signalled that it may pursue a formal resolution of the longstanding conflict on the peninsula. President Moon Jae-in and Mr Kim are due to meet next week.  The US president earlier gave his ""blessing"" for the talks between the South and North to discuss a peace treaty to formally end the 1950-1953 Korean War. Mr Pompeo's trip took place after he was nominated by Mr Trump to replace Rex Tillerson as secretary of state. Very little is known about the talks other than that they were to prepare for the forthcoming Trump-Kim summit.  Mr Pompeo is predicted to be confirmed as the top US diplomat by the Republican-controlled Senate in the coming weeks, although Democratic opposition to the conservative's candidacy is strong.  Senator Robert Menendez, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, said he did not think Mr Pompeo's ""past sentiments"" reflected American values. The hawkish CIA chief is known for his opposition to same-sex marriage and has made controversial remarks about Islam.  The US does not have diplomatic relations with North Korea, although diplomats have visited in the past and so-called ""back channels"" are used to communicate with Pyongyang. The last senior US official to meet a North Korean leader was Madeleine Albright, who was secretary of state when she travelled to Pyongyang for talks with Kim Jong-il, the father of the current leader.  In 2014, the then-head of National Intelligence James Clapper visited North Korea in a secret mission to negotiate the release of two US citizens. Mr Clapper did not meet the North Korean leader.  Mr Trump stunned the international community last month by accepting Pyongyang's suggestion for direct talks. It would be unprecedented for a sitting US president to meet a North Korean leader.  He said the summit would take place either in early June or ""a little before that"" and that several sites were under consideration.  Analysts have speculated that a location for talks could be the Demilitarised Zone between North and South Korea, another Asian country, or a neutral European country.  North Korea has been isolated for decades because of its human rights abuses and pursuit of nuclear weapons, in defiance of international laws and UN sanctions. It has carried out six nuclear tests, and has missiles that it says could reach the US. But South Korea's hosting of the Winter Olympics in February gave an unexpected window for diplomacy, and in the weeks since there have been a flurry of visits to the North from China, South Korea and now the US.  News of Mr Pompeo's visit is likely to overshadow delicate talks with Japan, a key US ally and neighbour of North Korea.  There have been fears in Tokyo that Mr Trump's plans for bilateral talks could sideline Japan, and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is currently in Florida for talks with the US leader. Relations between the two men appeared cordial on this, the second time that Mr Trump has welcomed Mr Abe to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. Mr Trump insisted on Tuesday that the two countries were ""very unified on the subject of North Korea"", and Mr Abe praised the US president's handling of the North Korea issue. However, observers say Mr Abe's goal for his US trip will be to persuade the US president as much as he can not to sway from the West's hard line on Pyongyang."
Hawkish,People urged not to travel in Storm Eunice,2024-09-25,2022-02-16,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-60403455,"People in Cornwall are being urged to only travel ""if absolutely necessary"" this Friday as Storm Eunice is set to cause disruption. Cornwall Council, which issued the warning, said people across the county were ""being urged to take precautions"". Those living in flood-risk areas along the north coasts of Cornwall, Devon and Somerset have been told to prepare for possible flooding. People are advised to stay away from the coast. The Environment Agency said strong winds, large waves and tidal surges were likely to cause wave-overtopping and floods during high tide on Friday. An amber weather warning for wind is in place across most of England from 03:00 GMT until 21:00 on Friday.  Analysis: David Braine, Senior Weather Presenter, BBC South West Storm Eunice is unusual because it has not yet formed, and normally we can follow areas of low pressure across the Atlantic as they develop and give reasonable guidance as to the track and the intensity.  The exact track and time of wind intensity is difficult to predict, but most of the computer models we use suggest that on Friday, between 09:00 to 12:00 GMT, there may well be damaging gusts close to 100mph (161km/h) along the north coasts of Devon and Cornwall. The last time we had such strength of wind was in February 2014, when the Dawlish railway line was washed away. This may well be stronger, but the winds being westerly means that the risk to Dawlish is small. Whilst there is still some uncertainty in the track of Eunice, there is an increasing likelihood of widespread inland wind gusts of 60 to 70mph, (97km/h to 113km/h) and up to 80mph (129km/h) in a few places.  Winds are expected to ease across western areas through Friday afternoon and eastern areas during the evening. Cornwall Council said: ""Residents are urged to pay close attention to the weather forecast over the next two days and are urged to only travel on Friday if absolutely necessary. ""People are urged to stay back from cliffs and seafronts due to the danger of large waves."" Devon County Council said it was also advising people to take extra care when travelling on Friday morning, because of possibilities of flying debris, fallen trees, damage to buildings and homes, roofs blown off and power lines brought down. High winds might also result in temporary bridge closures, including the Taw Bridge in Barnstaple, it said. Katharine Smith, Environment Agency flood duty manager, said: ""Strong winds could bring coastal flooding to parts of the west, south-west and south coast of England, as well as the tidal River Severn, through the early hours of Friday morning and into the early afternoon.   ""Environment Agency teams are out on the ground closing gates, erecting barriers and clearing screens where flood debris can build up, and stand ready to operate further flood defences if needed.  ""We urge people to stay safe on the coast and warn wave watchers against the unnecessary danger of taking 'storm selfies'.  Coastguards said boat owners should make sure their vessels were properly secured to moorings. Paddy Cochrane, from Falmouth Coastguard, told BBC Radio Cornwall: ""We would hope that boat owners, anybody who is out on moorings this time of the year, go out, double check your lines, make sure that all your moorings are properly secured, chain-to-chain rather than rope-to-chain if you can, or double up on your ropes. ""Just ensure that if you live on the coast that everything's battened down because we're going to get a fair old blow come through."" Windy weather this week has already affected events and facilities. In Cornwall, Truro Farmers' Market on Wednesday was postponed ahead of the storm, and the Jubilee Pool in Penzance announced it was closing until next Wednesday. The Environment Agency said people could keep up to date with the latest situation online and on its Twitter feed. Follow BBC News South West on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

Hawkish,The 11 BEST moments from Oscars night,2024-09-25,2018-03-05,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-43286325,"We all know who won the awards at the Oscars but who were the stars who won the night on social media?  He missed out on the best actor award to Gary Oldman but Timothee Chalamet was the most tweeted about celebrity on the red carpet, according to Twitter. He certainly looked like he was having the most fun.  James Ivory, who won the best adapted screenplay Oscar for Call Me By Your Name, in which Timothee starred, wore his face on his shirt - which went down a storm.  His reunion with his Call Me By Your Name co-star Armie Hammer on the red carpet also made a lot of people very happy. There was a lot of love for Timothee at the ceremony too and it seems he made sure he introduced his mum (aaaw!) to all the big names.   They weren't eligible to be nominated for this year's Oscars but the cast of Black Panther didn't let that stop them from reigning supreme on the red carpet, with the resulting hashtag #WakandaForever.  Chadwick Boseman was the second most tweeted about star on the red carpet.  He and his co-stars Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, Daniel Kaluuya and Winston Duke looked like Wakandan royalty. Danai Gurira and Lupita Nyong'o also had a good old catch up with Daniel Kaluuya on the red carpet. Tiffany Haddish also had a moment on the red carpet - and pretty much everywhere else she went at the Oscars.  She arrived in a traditional Eritrean dress to pay tribute to her dad who died last year, before changing her outfit to present an award with Maya Rudolph.  It was a more traditional affair... apart from the furry slippers. A lot of people on Twitter had time for those. Tiffany and Maya's double act went down a storm and many are convinced they should host next year.  Haddish changed her dress yet again for the after parties, where she and best actress winner Frances McDormand shared an... erm, interesting greeting.  Haddish also caused a stir on the red carpet when she crossed the velvet ropes to get to greet Meryl Streep.   Another star who wouldn't let barriers stop them seeing the Hollywood matriarch was Jennifer Lawrence.  Extra points for balancing the wine glass.  This year's set design drew a lot of attention on Twitter.   To celebrate the 90th anniversary of the awards, set designer Derek McLane used 45 million crystals in his sets - each of which was meant to reflect a different era in the history of movie making.   Jillian Leff was one who tweeted: ""I don't care about anything except the stage design"". Many suggested it should be up for an award in itself - including Katy Perry.  But not everyone was so keen - Jen Castle was one: ""I'm sorry but there's way too much going on with the set design tonight. It's like the Rococo era threw up on the stage"". History was made at the Oscars when Daniela Vega took to the stage - she became the first openly trans woman presenter in Oscars history when she introduced Sufjan Stevens's performance of Mystery of Love from Call Me By Your Name.  Her film A Fantastic Woman also won the best foreign film Oscar.   Patricia Arquette, whose late sister Alexis Arquette was a trans pioneer, was particularly happy.  The Shape of Water Director Guillermo del Toro was the second most tweeted-about star at the ceremony.  He won best director and best film. But after last year's mess up, he was taking no chances and checked his envelope to make sure.  Host Jimmy Kimmel's offer of a jet ski to whoever did the shortest speech went down well.  Dame Helen Mirren had the job of modelling the prize.  The winner was Mark Bridges who won best costume design for Phantom Thread. His speech comprised four words: ""Thank you very much"".  His happy face is now all over Twitter... He told the BBC's Rebecca Jones that it's all official but he has no idea how to get the vehicle home.   Her flowing royal blue gown landed her on the Oscars best dressed list but it seems Jennifer Garner will be remembered for the moment she had a life-changing revelation, mid-ceremony. Left the hob on? Forgot to pick up mum en route to the ceremony?? We REALLY want to find out what she was thinking about. The actress turned heads at the Vanity Fair party when she revealed a massive tattoo demonstrating her commitment to the Time's Up movement.  It got everyone talking - partly because it was Hermione with a massive tattoo - but also because it didn't adhere to standard punctuation rules. There was also much debate over whether or not it was real tattoo. The consensus seems to be it's semi-permanent. She might have to add the apostrophe with a sharpie.   Finally, a social media star who wasn't even at the Oscars.  We're guessing the Home Alone actor wasn't invited to the big event but that didn't stop him from dressing up at home as if he was.  He tweeted for seven hours - making a lot of jokes and quite a few digs at male stars tied to sexual harassment charges in the movie world.

Hawkish,Stephen Hawking service ballot opens,2024-09-25,2018-05-09,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-44043605,"The public is being offered the chance to attend a service of thanksgiving for Professor Stephen Hawking, who died in March aged 76. It will take place in Westminster Abbey on 15 June and up to 1,000 tickets are available in a ballot. During the service, the scientist's ashes will be interred between Sir Isaac Newton and Charles Darwin. His daughter, Lucy Hawking, said she wanted to give some of her father's admirers the chance to remember him. The family were grateful to Westminster Abbey for giving her father ""such a distinguished final resting place"", she said.  The Dean of Westminster, The Very Reverend Dr John Hall, said the event would celebrate ""not only his remarkable achievements as a scientist, but also his character and endurance through his years living with a devastating illness"". Professor Hawking is considered one of the world's most renowned theoretical physicists. His funeral was held on 31 March at the university church, Great St Mary's, in Cambridge.  Actor Eddie Redmayne, who played Professor Hawking in the film about his life, The Theory of Everything, was one of several speakers there.  In addition to Professor Hawking's friends and family, the service will be attended by colleagues, academics and schoolchildren.

Hawkish,Plans to move rail line delayed after consultation,2024-09-25,2020-10-14,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-54538258,"Plans to move a railway line further out to sea to avoid cliff falls have been delayed after an ""unprecedented"" public response to the scheme. Network Rail said it was going to ""take more time to revise the plans"" for the line north of Teignmouth in Devon. The 1.1-mile (1.8km) stretch is vulnerable to damage from rock falls and overtopping waves. Critics said the scheme would result in the loss of about a mile of beach and was ""totally excessive"". Richard Ward, from Save Our Beach, welcomed the decision, saying: ""It is just too grand - there are simpler, cheaper solutions which they can start talking to us about now. ""It is just far too costly and more expensive per km than HS2, and a totally excessive plan from day one and totally unjustified expenditure. A better solution involves rock shelters and some breakwaters.""  Network Rail said more than half of the 1,600 people who responded to the consultation opposed the plans, but ""there was a really strong support for doing something, as doing nothing is not an option"". The main line at nearby Dawlish collapsed and was washed into the sea during storms in February 2014. Work to raise the sea wall at Dawlish stared in June but Network Rail is also looking at ways to protect the line between Holcombe and Teignmouth. Richard Griffith, from the rail operator, said: ""The railway is an absolutely vital artery for the whole of the south west.  ""We have to keep that railway open at all costs. But we also have to consider the impact on the local community and the environment."" Further consultation will take place next year."
Hawkish,Ukrainian teenager died from 'multiple injuries',2024-09-25,2023-03-15,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-64967782,"A teenager from Ukraine found unconscious on a Devon beach died from multiple injuries, a coroner has said. Albina Yevko, a 14-year-old refugee, died in hospital after she was found unconscious on the beach at Dawlish. Alison Longhorn, area coroner for Devon, confirmed there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding her death on 5 March. She said a post-mortem conducted by a Home Office pathologist found she had died from ""multiple injures"".  She added that further tests were being carried out to establish the exact cause of death. The coroner said she was awaiting a full autopsy report and the laboratory tests before a full inquest could be held at Exeter's County Hall at a later date. Devon and Cornwall Police also described her death as ""not suspicious"". The force said a CCTV trawl, a port-mortem and a review of Albina's phone showed there was no third party involvement in her death. Det Insp Becky Davies said: ""Our investigation shows that Albina had settled very well in the UK since moving from Ukraine and enjoyed living by the sea and being part of a new family. ""She had made good friends, both Ukrainian and English in the UK, enjoyed school and was very much welcomed by the local community."" Albina, who was living in the Dawlish area with her mother, moved to the UK in May last year after Russia's invasion. Police said the Ukrainian Embassy was made aware of her death.

Hawkish,The 'black girl magic' of Girls Trip,2024-09-25,2017-07-25,By Taylor-Dior Rumble,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-40704746,"Female-driven comedy Girls Trip exceeded all expectations at the US box office when it was released last weekend - a fact its star Jada Pinkett Smith puts down to the power of laughter.  It made $31.2m (£23.9m) in its first three days, following behind Christopher Nolan's war epic Dunkirk which took $50.5m (£38.8m). That makes it the biggest opening weekend for any live-action comedy this year.  The film follows the story of four lifelong friends who re-unite for a weekend getaway in New Orleans. The fact it's an R-rated comedy fronted by four women makes its success even sweeter for Pinkett Smith and co-stars Queen Latifah, Regina Hall and newcomer Tiffany Haddish. ""Laughter is universal, people love to laugh,"" Pinkett Smith told the BBC, commenting on the film's success. ""One woman is every woman and the themes in the film are universal, even though we could be different ages and experience different things."" She said she was delighted to see women of all races enjoying the film, adding: ""As women, the things we care about and some of the things happening in our lives will be similar and that is the success of the movie."" Girls Trip seems to have broken the R-rated curse following a summer of disappointing comedy films.  Will Ferrell and Amy Poehler's The House, about a couple that start an underground casino to put their daughter through university, opened to just short of $9m (£7m).  Baywatch also drowned over a public holiday weekend taking $18m (£13.8m) and a few weeks before that, Amy Schumer and Goldie Hawn's Snatched was considered a box office flop with its $19.5m (£15m) opening.  The last R-rated comedy to have been a worldwide sensation was The Hangover in 2009, which earned $45m (£34.5m) in its opening weekend in the US and $467m (£359m) worldwide.  So what made Girls Trip immune to this comedy curse? Director Malcolm D Lee puts it down to a little sprinkle of what he calls ""black girl magic"".   ""Black girl magic is real - people want a piece of it, they want to see it, they want to be empowered by it,"" he told The Hollywood Reporter. Another film that was praised for its black girl magic was Oscar-nominated Hidden Figures, which told the story of a team of female African-American mathematicians who served a vital role in Nasa during the early years of the US space programme.  After its opening weekend in 2016, its star Taraji P Henson - wrote on Instagram as it took the number one spot at the box office: ""I have been told my entire career 'black women can't open films domestically or internationally'. Well, anything is possible.""  Lee also alluded to film's success in relation to his own movie saying: ""Four black women can open a movie and it does not have to be about the space program. ""Hidden Figures did extremely well and I'm extremely happy for that movie to have done that - it's unprecedented - but here we are for women who exist in real life and don't get an opportunity to see themselves like this."" The success of films like Hidden Figures, Oscar-winning Moonlight and now Girls Trip always reignites the debate on social media about representation in film. ""Here we have the opportunity to see ourselves not as maids, slaves or receptacles for casual misogynoir (misogyny directed towards black women), but as autonomous beings who experience the fullness of joy and unadulterated happiness,"" says British writer and producer Danielle Dash. ""Girls Trip is important for black women because we are represented by women who look like us in roles that were written by people who look like us and other people we love."" Whilst the success of directors and writers such as Get Out's Jordan Peele and Insecure's Issa Rae are important, the black experience in TV and film tends to be oversaturated by African-Americans, rather than coming from the British-black perspective. This could be one of the many reasons Michaela Coel's Chewing Gum was such a popular success - she took home two Baftas for her work on the show in 2016. Dash believes that when British TV and film industries give projects with black voices the same time and effort in development, the companies who commit to uplifting minority voices will reap the benefits financially. And Pinkett Smith couldn't agree more.  ""As much as we want the moral stakes to matter, it's a very profitable move,"" she says.  ""I think that it being a deeply unexplored area will make for a very creative project that people will have deep interest in. We constantly realise that in the States. ""People are always interested in how other people live because some don't get to see that experience. You're really doing your creative culture a disservice by not highlighting those different cultures."" Girls Trip will be released in the UK on 26 July.

Hawkish,Norway jails top policeman for smuggling hashish,2024-09-25,2017-09-18,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-41313700,"A senior Norwegian police officer has been sentenced to 21 years in prison for taking bribes and aiding a notorious drug smuggler. Eirik Jensen, who was responsible for combating organised crime in the capital Oslo, was arrested in 2014. On Monday, a court found he had received at least 667,800 kroner (€71,300, £63,200) in bribes to help smuggle tonnes of hashish into Norway. He denies the charges and plans to appeal, his lawyer said. Jensen's 21-year sentence for corruption was the maximum permitted under the law, and a rare event in Norway. It is frequently named one of the least corrupt countries, and placed sixth in the 2016 global rankings by anti-corruption watchdog Transparency International. Norway country profile  Jensen helped smuggle nearly 14 tonnes of the cannabis resin between 2004 and 2013, his trial heard. A key witness was his co-conspirator, hashish smuggler Gjermund Cappelen, who admitted importing the drug and was sentenced to 15 years in prison. Norwegian media report his sentence was reduced in exchange for his co-operation in exposing Jensen. Jensen and Cappelenm exchanged hundreds of text messages over a decade, some of which included coded details of police and customs activity, Oslo's district court was told.  Jensen's legal team maintained they were indicative of a police officer conducting normal investigative work with an informant. Judges, however, were not convinced.  The court found the messages had been sent in ""simple codes"", broadcaster NRK reports (in Norwegian), and that texts about ""sunshine"" were designed to indicate that Cappelenm was not under police observation and could safely import his product. Reading the verdict, Judge Kim Heger said the high-ranking officer had deliberately contributed to the import of drugs, in a case which was unique in the country's legal history. It has attracted widespread attention in Norway, dominating headlines."

National Rail Enquiries said the combination in the Dawlish area had resulted in the line between Dawlish and Exeter St Davids being blocked. A 50mph speed limit on rail lines in the areas worst affected by the storm has also been introduced. Great Western Railway (GWR) was advising customers not to travel unless ""absolutely essential"". The GWR train, which has since been moved, broke-down at Dawlish station.  GWR said customers should expect delays or cancellations throughout Tuesday. Trains between Taunton and Penzance in Cornwall may be delayed due to the speed restrictions, it said. CrossCountry services may also be delayed or amended, National Rail Enquiries said. In Cornwall, sailings on the St Mawes Ferry have been cancelled due to sea conditions and severe gale force winds. There are numerous flood alerts in place across Devon and Cornwall. The Met Office has issued a yellow wind warning for the South West from 0900 GMT until 18:00 GMT on Wednesday. It has also issued yellow weather warnings for most of the UK. It said the conditions could cause power cuts and disruption on the roads. The Higher Ferry and Lower Ferry between Kingswear and Dartmouth, in south Devon, suspended its services earlier due to the tides and strong winds.

Hawkish,UK warship seizes three tonnes of hashish,2024-09-25,2018-11-26,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-46346367,"Three tonnes of hashish - with a street value of millions of pounds - has been seized in the Gulf.  The Royal Navy warship HMS Dragon was on patrol in the Middle East, in a drug-smuggling route known as the ""Hash Highway"", when it came across the suspicious boat.  Sailors and Royal Marines boarded the vessel and found 148 bags of hashish hidden on board. It's one of the Royal Navy's biggest drugs busts in the region this year. The bags of drugs seized on the dhow, a type of vessel common in the Middle East, weighed 3,048kg. The seizure, on Sunday, deals ""a major blow to the funding of terrorism"", the Ministry of Defence said. The Hash Highway is the route that smugglers use to transport drugs from Afghanistan to east Africa and the Middle East. Profits are thought to fund criminal networks and terrorist groups.   Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said: ""Alongside keeping key shipping channels safe, countering piracy and providing disaster relief, the Royal Navy makes a significant contribution to global security by tackling the illicit drugs trade. ""The success of HMS Dragon's seizure is the latest blow struck to this nefarious industry.""  The commanding officer of the Royal Navy Type 45 destroyer, Commander Mike Carter-Quinn, said: ""This seizure is testament not only to days of focused hard work, but also to months of effort in preparation for HMS Dragon's operational deployment. ""The Dragons - all 260 of my crew, from the Royal Navy, Royal Marines, and US Coastguard - have done themselves and their families proud and I couldn't be more honoured to serve with them every day."" HMS Dragon, which is based in Portsmouth, is part of the Combined Task Force 150 which looks after security in the world's major shipping lanes. "
Hawkish,US jobs growth slows in August,2024-09-25,2022-09-02,By Noor Nanji,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-62767748,"US employers added 315,000 new jobs in August, far fewer than in July, as fears rise that the labour market is heading for a slowdown. The jobless rate rose to 3.7% from 3.5%, according to the figures from the US Labor Department. The report comes on the back of recent data which showed the world's biggest economy continues to shrink. The US central bank, the Federal Reserve, is raising interest rates to rein in surging prices. August's figure for non-farm payrolls is sharply lower than July, when US employers added more than 500,000 jobs. However, the number is slightly higher than economists were expecting. The Federal Reserve is keeping a close watch on the jobs market, while investors will also have been awaiting the latest data for any signs indicating the economy is heading into a recession. Last week, the Fed's chairman, Jerome Powell, warned that interest rates need to continue rising to stop inflation from becoming a permanent aspect of the US economy. Inflation - the rate at which prices are rising - in the US is at a 40-year high. Higher borrowing costs aim to reduce spending and curb inflation, but they can also slow economic activity. The Fed is hoping the labour market remains strong enough to allow it to raise rates without triggering a recession. The US economy has shrunk for two quarters in a row. In many countries, that milestone would already be considered an economic recession. Yet that is not the case in the US, which uses additional data to make that call. Janet Mui, head of market analysis at wealth manager Brewin Dolphin, said the rise in the US unemployment rate was ""an uncomfortable read"". ""However, it remains at a near historic low and was driven by an increase in labour force participation - meaning more people were in the labour force working or looking for work - which is good news for policymakers,"" she added. Ms Mui said that while the job creation figure was higher than economists' expectations, wage growth came in slightly lower than predictions. Friday's report showed average hourly pay up 5.2% compared with August 2021. ""Overall, this is a good set of data and underpins a resilient and tight job market. Today's report does little to change the Fed's hawkish resolve but is modestly supportive of the peak US inflation narrative,"" Ms Mui continued. "

Hawkish,'No progress' on Hawking memorial plans,2024-09-25,2019-03-14,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-47537266,"Plans for a public memorial to Prof Stephen Hawking in Cambridge are no further forward a year after his death, a councillor has said. The renowned physicist died aged 76 after a long battle with motor neurone disease on 14 March last year. Cambridge City Council unanimously passed a motion in April to create a permanent tribute to Prof Hawking. But councillor Rod Cantrill said he had seen ""no evidence"" of progress a year on ""after making a public commitment"". Council leader Lewis Herbert said a ""few options"" were still on the table. Ideas include the installation of a free public telescope, a black hole sculpture at the Guildhall or naming the proposed railway station at Addenbrooke's after him.    Liberal Democrat councillor Mr Cantrill said naming one of the city's public parks after Prof Hawking would be a fitting tribute. He said: ""At the time I made it clear that we need to do something to mark Prof Hawking's contribution, not just to the university and the city but to the world of science. ""He made very complex science accessible to the person on the street."" Prof Paul Shellard, director of the Stephen Hawking Centre for Theoretical Cosmology in Cambridge, said it was important to ""establish in perpetuity his legacy"" in the city. ""It was a great privilege to observe his courage and determination and the good humour with which he faced the many challenges of his own life,"" he said. Mr Herbert said discussions were taking place between the council, Cambridge University and Gonville and Caius College over what form a permanent memorial would take. A memorial flagstone was installed in September in a private ceremony outside the late scientist's room in Caius Court. In June, the scientist's ashes were interred in Westminster Abbey following a public memorial service which celebrated his life."

Hawkish,Phone snaps aim to track coastal erosion,2024-09-25,2020-10-01,By Amy Gladwell,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-54286738,"Hundreds of beachgoers' smartphone photos are being gathered to track the impact of rising sea levels and climate change. About 10 mobile phone mounts are being installed at key points across south-west England, for people to take pictures then upload them to a website. The data, gathered by Plymouth Coastal Observatory (PCO), will be used to help authorities shape beach management. It was a ""fantastic idea"" to engage people, the Environment Agency said. Dawlish Warren in Devon, Porthmeor in St Ives, Cornwall, and West Bay in Dorset are among those to have the mounts. The Environment Agency has secured funding from the South West Regional Flood and Coastal Committee for the CoastSnap project, which was inspired by a successful scheme in New South Wales, Australia, PCO said. It aims to collect photos taken across varying tidal stages, linking beach erosion to weather conditions, the seasons and storms. Joseff Saunders, Coastal Process Scientist from PCO, said: ""Coastal erosion is a very real problem and it is going to become more apparent going forward."" He said seven phone stations had been put in place in 2020 after a pilot in 2019 and two to three more should be installed before the winter.  ""It just exploded this summer after lockdown. Lots of people were out and about and we were getting upwards of 30 to 40 photos submitted a day. A couple of weeks ago we passed the 1,000 mark,"" he said.

More stations are due to follow."
Hawkish,Israel election: Who are the key candidates?,2024-09-25,2019-04-05,By Joel Greenberg,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-47572296,"Israelis will vote on 9 April in what is being billed as one of the toughest general elections Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has yet faced. His right-wing Likud party is in a tight race with the new centre-right Blue and White alliance, which has been gaining ground in the polls in recent months. But other parties could end up being kingmakers when they try to form a governing coalition. These are the politicians set to play a major role in the election and its aftermath.  If he emerges victorious once again, Mr Netanyahu is poised to overtake David Ben-Gurion as Israel's longest-serving prime minister.  He has been in power for three consecutive terms since 2009 and also led Israel from 1996 to 1999.   The Likud leader has built a reputation as a consummate political survivor, presenting himself as the only candidate qualified to safeguard Israel's security and guide its international relations.  Both in office and on the campaign trail, he has depicted Israel as facing an array of external threats, including Iran, Lebanon's Shia Islamist Hezbollah movement, and the Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip. Mr Netanyahu has previously endorsed a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but has qualified that statement since by saying he would support a ""state-minus,"" or a demilitarised state under Israel's security control. During the election campaign, he has warned that his challengers would allow the creation of a Palestinian state, calling it a mortal threat to Israel. A decision by Israel's attorney general to indict Mr Netanyahu in three corruption cases pending a final hearing has put a dent in his re-election campaign, and it remains unclear whether this will ultimately rally supporters around him or drive voters away. If he is to form the next government, Mr Netanyahu is likely to have to rely on other right-wing and religious parties.  Touting his security credentials as a former chief of staff of the Israel Defense Forces, Benny Gantz has emerged as a serious challenger to Mr Netanyahu.  A newcomer to politics, the retired general formed the Blue and White alliance in February with the leader of the centrist Yesh Atid party, Yair Lapid, and two other former IDF chiefs of staff, Moshe Yaalon and Gabi Ashkenazi.  Mr Gantz has promised to bring a different style to Israel's government and end what he has called Mr Netanyahu's polarising rhetoric.  Mr Gantz's election ads have trumpeted his military record, featuring a body count of Palestinian militants and scenes of destruction from the war in Gaza that he oversaw in 2014.  Seeking to draw right-leaning voters away from Mr Netanyahu, Mr Gantz has talked tough on Iran and echoed the prime minister's positions on the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. He has avoided mention of a two-state solution and ruled out unilateral withdrawals in the occupied West Bank, pledging to bolster large Israeli settlement blocs there and maintain the IDF's freedom of action throughout the territory. Settlements are seen as illegal under international law, although Israel disagrees.   The son of Holocaust survivors, Mr Gantz grew up in a farming community. He held a number of important positions in the IDF during his 38 years of service, including commander of Israeli forces in southern Lebanon when they withdrew in 2000 and commander of forces in the West Bank at the start of the second Palestinian intifada, or uprising. He served as chief of staff from 2011 to 2015. To unseat Mr Netanyahu, Blue and White will need to ally with several smaller parties. But it is unclear whether it would be able to muster enough seats to win a majority in parliament. Yair Lapid heads the centrist Yesh Atid party and is deputy leader of the Blue and White alliance.    Under an agreement with Mr Gantz, he will take over from him as prime minister after two-and-a-half years should Blue and White win the election.   His previous experience in government was a stint as finance minister under Mr Netanyahu between 2013 and 2014. A former journalist and broadcaster, Mr Lapid is guiding Blue and White's election campaign, focusing its message on the possible corruption charges the prime minister faces. Mr Lapid has supported ""separation"" from the Palestinians and in the past endorsed a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, though he has not repeated that call in the current campaign. He has also been outspoken in his opposition to political alliances with Israeli Arab parties, whose backing in parliament after the elections might give Blue and White the majority it would need to form a government.  The education and justice ministers are presenting themselves as genuine right-wing alternatives to Mr Netanyahu.  Mr Bennett and Ms Shaked quit the the religious pro-settlement Jewish Home party in December to form their own party, the New Right, which seeks to attract both secular and religious voters.  Advocating hawkish policies toward the Palestinians, Mr Bennett has criticised the prime minister for not cracking down hard on Hamas militants in Gaza in response to rocket attacks on Israeli communities. Mr Bennett has vowed to ""defeat"" Hamas if New Right wins the election. He has unveiled a five-point plan that includes ""pounding Hamas from the air"", ""targeted assassinations"" of the group's leaders, and the ""permanent demilitarisation"" of Gaza. He has also accused Mr Netanyahu of working with Donald Trump to form a blueprint for a Palestinian state in the US president's long-awaited Middle East peace plan. Mr Bennett vehemently opposes such a state, calling it a threat to Israel's existence. As justice minister, Ms Shaked presided over the appointment of more conservative judges to Israel's Supreme Court, arguing that it had a liberal tilt and intervened too often in government decisions. If New Right wins, she wants to give parliament the power to re-pass laws struck down by the Supreme Court. The leader of the centre-left Labour party looks destined for an unremarkable showing at the polls.  A former cabinet minister who was previously CEO of Israel's largest telecoms company, Mr Gabbay appealed to right-wing voters after he was elected Labour's leader in 2017.  He dismissed the notion of evacuating Jewish settlements in the West Bank and declared that ""the left has forgotten what it is to be Jewish"", echoing a phrase once used by Mr Netanyahu.  However in the current election campaign, Mr Gabbay has sought to highlight the differences between Labour, Likud and Blue and White. Mr Gabbay has called for a Middle East peace deal that would see a demilitarised Palestinian state established. A three-step ""separation plan"" put forward by Labour calls for an immediate end to building at outlying Jewish settlements deep inside the West Bank, legislation to compensate residents willing to leave those settlements, and a referendum for Israelis on the status of Arab areas on the outskirts of occupied East Jerusalem. Mr Gabbay has argued that unlike Mr Gantz, he offers a true alternative to the policies of Mr Netanyahu, though he has turned down an offer to merge Labour with Meretz, the flagship party of the Israeli left.  He has also insisted that under no circumstances would Labour join a coalition government that included Mr Netanyahu.  Moshe Feiglin, a maverick politician with a mix of libertarian and ultra-nationalist views, is best known for his support for the legalisation of cannabis.  His Zehut party has emerged as a popular alternative, attracting Israelis seeking to cast a protest vote, and if it wins several seats he could emerge as a kingmaker when coalition talks start. He has said Zehut will join a coalition that will go furthest towards advancing its goals. A religious West Bank settler who began his political career in the Likud party, Mr Feiglin wants to drastically reduce the number of government ministries,  and replace state schools with a voucher system that would fund tuition at private schools. He supports ending the registration of marriages through the Chief Rabbinate, allowing people to marry whomever they wish, including someone of the same sex. He has also called for US military aid to Israel and IDF conscription to end. However, Mr Feiglin's laissez-faire positions are coupled with a hardline approach to the Palestinians.  He supports the cancellation of the Oslo Accords and annexation of the West Bank, and would give Palestinians the option of emigrating or remaining as permanent residents. He also advocates moving Israeli government offices to East Jerusalem, which Palestinians want to be their future capital, and building a synagogue on the contested holy site known to Jews as Temple Mount and to Muslims as Haram al-Sharif.

Hawkish,Call to keep dogs on leads to protect nests,2024-09-25,2022-04-15,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-61097581,"Dog owners are being reminded to keep their dogs on leads to avoid putting ground-nesting birds at risk. Ground-nesting birds can be found on moorland, in fields, urban parks or the beach during the spring and summer. Blackbirds, oyster catchers and nightjars are among the species that nest on the ground or just above it. Harry Barton, chief executive of Devon Wildlife Trust, said ""ideally dogs should be kept on short leads from March to September"". He added: ""The number of birds we have got is much fewer than 10 or 20 years ago. One thing we can all do is reduce the disturbance our dogs cause.  ""Dogs are fantastic companions and we love them coming to our reserves, but dogs can do a couple of things.  ""They can run around and put up birds that are nesting on the ground. And also, by running around in the undergrowth, they make the whole undergrowth smell of dog and as far as a bird is concerned a dog is a predator so they will come and smell the predator and think 'this isn't safe for us, we will go elsewhere'.""  Some beaches have cordoned-off areas to protect some of the rarest birds' nests, but the trust says ""it is best to keep dogs on leads on all beaches and the wider countryside until chicks have fledged in September"". Devon Wildlife Trust said some of its sites are not suitable for dog walkers due to being home to rare and fragile species, including South Efford Marsh, Dawlish Inner Warren, Exe Reed Beds and Horsey Island - and it urges owners check before visiting individual reserve.

Hawkish,The Oscars: What you may have missed,2024-09-25,2018-03-05,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-43284188,"If you just looked at the top awards at The Oscars, you'd miss a lot of the fun. The big winners were all fairly predictable with the early favourites taking home statues. But there were still plenty of surprises - from a ""win"" for Hollyoaks and a former basketball star, to the $100,000 (£72,500) goody bag, to Helen Mirren giving a way a jet ski. Here's some of the stuff you may have missed. That's right. The former basketball star turned his hand to filmmaking on a short animated film called Dear Basketball. The five-minute film is based on a love letter to the sport he wrote in 2015. He threw shade at a Fox News presenter in his speech, who said earlier this year basketball players should ""shut up and dribble"" instead of getting involved in politics. But in the year of Time's Up, some people are questioning the win - in 2003 Bryant was accused of rape by a woman with whom he eventually reached an out-of-court settlement. The Oscar for best live action short film went to not one, but two former Hollyoaks stars. Rachel Shenton, who played Mitzee Minniver, wrote The Silent Child, while its director was Chris Overton - who played cage fighter Liam McAllister back in 2010. Let's be honest, Oscars speeches can go on a bit. How do you encourage people to keep it short? With Helen Mirren on a jet ski, of course. Host Jimmy Kimmel promised a jet ski to the winner with the shortest speech - before unveiling Dame Helen modelling the prize. Congrats to Mark Bridges, who won for best costume design for Phantom Thread, and whose 36-second speech won him the jet ski. Dame not included. As promised, actress and comedian Tiffany Haddish wore THAT dress again. She's worn the white Alexander McQueen dress, which she once joked was worth ""more than my mortgage"", three times now. Tiffany first wore it at the Girls Trip premiere, before wearing it again on Saturday Night Live last year, saying she'll wear it ""multiple times"" because it's so expensive. On the red carpet, she wore a dress inspired by her Eritrean roots - and she also fangirled over Meryl Streep. She continued the love-in on the Oscars stage, telling Meryl she wants her to ""be my mama one day"". Timothee Chalamet has had a big year, starring in films such as Lady Bird and Call Me By Your Name. The 22-year-old has gained a lot of fans along the way. But no bigger than the writer of Call Me By Your Name, James Ivory, who literally wore a shirt with Timothee's face on it. By the way, James Ivory winning for best adapted screenplay not only meant that the shirt made an appearance on stage - it also makes him the oldest ever Oscar winner at 89.  So nominees from the main categories get a goody bag worth $100,000 (£72,500) just for turning up at the ceremony. Included is a 12-night trip to Tanzania, a week-long stay in Hawaii and a week-long spa pass - as well as some posh tea bags and oranges. By the way, according to Forbes, companies have to pay at least $4,000 for the privilege of being included in the bag. But spare a thought for the poor nominees this year, who miss out on 2016's haul, which was worth $200,000 and included sex toys and a portable vaporiser. Get Out writer/director Jordan Peele won for best original screenplay. And he was quite shocked. It's fair to say his friend and frequent collaborator Keegan-Michael Key was pretty chuffed too. Host Jimmy Kimmel wanted to thank cinema-goers for supporting movies. Luckily for him, there's a cinema right next door to where the Oscars are hosted. So the likes of Mark Hamill, Lupita Nyong'o, Margot Robbie and Gal Gadot crashed a screening of A Wrinkle in Time and handed out snacks. Jimmy Kimmel wanted to let the audience know that there was a ""strong smell of marijuana"" in the cinema, suggesting these people needed the snacks more than most. Was the stage a bit much? Yes, it was made up of 45 million crystals and took 3,000 hours to build. That's 125 straight days of work. Follow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.

Hawkish,Minister opens station and unveils sea wall plaque,2024-09-25,2023-07-03,Jonathan Morris,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0384pvz1m3o,"Secretary of State for Transport Mark Harper has opened a new railway station at Marsh Barton in Exeter. The £16m station should have been up and running in 2022, but the project faced issues with building supplies and bad weather.  He also unveiled a plaque in Dawlish to mark the completion of the sea wall.   The £82m project aims to protect the line from extreme weather after the track was destroyed by storms in 2014. The station at Marsh Barton includes a new pedestrian and cycle bridge which opened in April. It will be served by hourly Great Western Railway services from Tuesday between Paignton and Exmouth, with half-hourly services at peak times. Devon County Councillor Andrea Davis, cabinet member for climate change, environment and transport, said: ""Today's a fantastic day.  ""There have been challenges getting to this point.  ""But what we've got now is this amazing station, which is available for the residents of the south west to get into Exeter; great connectivity for Marsh Barton Trading Estate, the hospital and the county council.  ""We are really delighted this day has come."" It follows the opening of new stations at Newcourt and Cranbrook, as well as the opening of the Dartmoor Line between Exeter and Okehampton. In February 2014, rail passengers to and from Cornwall and most of Devon were left without a connection to the national network after the storms left the line at Dawlish dangling in the air. The line was reopened two months later and was followed by major work on the sea wall. The work at Dawlish includes a new promenade and Network Rail is building a new footbridge with lifts at Dawlish Station.  Further cliff protection work including a rockfall shelter at Holcombe, along the coast from Dawlish, is continuing.  Michelle Handforth, regional managing director of Network Rail’s Wales and Western Region, said the sea wall would ""protect the railway line and town of Dawlish for generations to come"". Mr Harper said he was ""delighted"" at the ""completion of two major projects"" which he said were on a ""vital rail route for passengers in the South West"".

Hawkish,Vigil held over US abortion ruling,2024-09-25,2022-07-05,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0j098v5x0vo,"About 50 people gathered in a Devon seaside town to show solidarity with women in the United States following the Supreme Court ruling to end the right to an abortion.   The campaigners in Teignmouth said they feared the decision to overturn the Roe v Wade case in 1973 will have a knock on effect both in the UK and around the world.  In response to similar concerns following the US ruling, Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab said there was not a ""strong case for changing""  the right to abortions in the UK.  Speeches were given on the issue and people held up placards.  Vigil organiser Peta Howell said: ""I was really angry about the ruling over Roe and Wade in America and the implications that has on the health of women...  ""But also it reflects what's going on around the world... It's a worldwide problem,"" she said. ""It's wonderful that people are getting out and showing that anger,"" she added. Ms Howell said she feared the ruling could pave the way for further equality laws to be ""ripped up"" and that it was important to show the UK government how strongly some people felt.  ""The same people that are funding campaigns in America are funding campaigns in the UK,"" she said. ""It's a slippery slope that we're facing"" she claimed. Danielle Rose-White, one of the attendees, said: ""Stuff transcends over the Atlantic. ""If there was any encouragement from the decision for our government to do the same thing, we are going to show them that that's not acceptable."" Emma Parker, from Dawlish Warren, said: ""I just find it frightening and I think that if we don't take a stand and talk about it that we're letting our sisters down in America."" The overturning of Roe v Wade has provoked fury amongst pro-choice campaigners in the US, alongside jubilation from anti-abortion activists."
Hawkish,New flood warning services in Devon towns,2024-09-25,2021-08-18,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9z86d5qep4o,"Hundreds of homes and businesses in Devon are getting new flood warning services to tell people about any imminent risk, the Environment Agency has said. The agency said more than 400 properties would be auto-registered to receive warnings for the Dawlish Water in Dawlish and more than 250 properties for the River Umber in Combe Martin.    Managers said the scheme was being introduced after ""numerous flood events over the years"" in Dawlish, particularly in 2012. Combe Martin also suffered flooding in 1958, 1960, 2016 and in 2018 as well as landslides. The agency said the climate emergency meant it could not ""prevent all flooding"", but it was ""working to make communities resilient to future flooding"". It said three types of warning would be issued: flood alert, flood warning and severe flood warning.  Each warning would be triggered by particular weather, river or sea conditions which cause flooding. The Environment Agency set out the levels of alert: Ben Johnstone, from the agency, said: ""We know the devastating impact that flooding can have, which is why protecting people and communities is our top priority.  ""However, the climate emergency means we cannot prevent all flooding – so we’re working to make communities resilient to future flooding.  ""We want to ensure that everyone has as much time as possible to prepare for flooding.""  The agency said people could register their preferred contact details on its website."

Devon County Council said the session will be held at Haberton Parish Hall on Tuesday between 15:35 BST and 19:15. It is the third drop-in session since flash floods hit in September. Torrential rain caused widespread flooding across the county, including in Dawlish, Torquay and Exeter.   More than 200 homes were flooded, the authority said. The council said the experiences of people at the meeting would help inform a flood investigation report. It also said the aim of the report was to highlight the extent of flooding and what was needed to help communities. Gary Taylor, Teignbridge Council's executive member for planning, said pervious drop-in sessions at Kenton and Topsham provided ""valuable information"" to the authority. He said: ""This shared local knowledge will undoubtedly help identify how we can increase resilience in the future, when extreme, unexpected weather events occur in our area.” Follow BBC News South West on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

Dawlish Town Council, which is putting up to £200,000 into the project, gave the go-ahead at a meeting on Tuesday.

Black Torrington, Bridgerule and Dolton in Torridge, Cockwood and Dawlish in Teignbridge and Uffculme in Mid Devon have all been chosen. Devon County Council said it received ""significant numbers"" of requests for 20mph schemes each year. It said average speed, the number of vulnerable road users in an area, speed-related collision history, and the level of support for a 20mph scheme were all factors it considered when allocating new schemes. Other factors include the presence of an active Community Speed Watch and the community’s deprivation index ranking. In January, Devon County Council asked councillors to talk to the communities they represented and submit expressions of interest for new schemes. In total, 57 applications were received. Each community was then ranked using a priority matrix and the six communities with the highest scores were put forward for new schemes. Councillor Stuart Hughes, Devon County Council’s cabinet member for highway management, said identifying the communities ""most in need"" of 20mph schemes ensured the council's resources were focused where there would be ""the greatest benefit"". Mr Hughes said the 20mph schemes helped communities feel safer, and ""created the conditions for increased active travel"" by making walking and cycling safer and easier."

Over the past five years the Cheltenham-based adventurer has been hiking the route in sections, and is due to finish next summer. On the way he takes pictures and sells the prints to help fund the self-supported project. He said winter was ""the most beautiful time of the year"". Mr Lake said at this time of year his daily walking routine meant he began before dawn and ended after dusk, so he got to see ""the sun rise and set followed by the moon rise and the stars emerge"". ""The silent drama of these happenings is accentuated when reflected in the sea and I often see and feel the visceral effect of the moon on the tide,"" he said. Mr Lake began his mammoth 11,000 km (7,000 mile) trek in April 2015 in London and has been hoping to finish in June 2020. He said the aim of the project was artistic"". ""I want to get a better understanding of the mystery and beauty of the British landscape and convey that through photography."" When he is not walking he returns to his home in Cheltenham, where he works as an architectural photographer. He walks 15-25 miles (25-40 km) each day, and takes photographs for about three hours. ""As I don't have a support team and much of the coast, especially in Scotland, is far from roads and facilities, I mostly wild camp,"" he said. ""Along with a tent I carry food, fuel and batteries so I can be self-sufficient for five days at a time which equates to around 20kg on my back."" ""I don't take ferries but instead cross at the first bridge across rivers and estuaries,"" he said. ""So in England and Wales, this is mostly on marked trails but in Scotland (which is approximately half the length) it's an entirely different proposition, as much of the walking is off-trail and often in very rough and remote mountainous terrain in the North West."" He tries to stay ""as close to the coast while staying safe"".  He walks in sections of up to six weeks at a time before returning home for a month or two.  Since he began his walk he has sustained two injuries - a split tendon in his foot and a stress injury in his shin - both which required a couple of months rest to recover.  Mr Lake said he ""enjoys the focus of mind"" when long-distance walking in winter. ""As there are so few hours of daylight, one has to be moving from dawn to dusk to be able to cover the distance.   ""The low sun angle of winter light and the resulting high tonal range create unique photographic challenges and opportunities."" All photographs by Quintin Lake."
Hawkish,Joe Sugg gives YouTubers hope for TV success,2024-09-25,2019-02-17,By Daniel Rosney,https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-47266811,"Joe Sugg says his success on Strictly Come Dancing has given other YouTubers hope of having successful TV careers. The 27-year-old made it to the final of the show in December, losing to Stacey Dooley. Speaking at a conference for vloggers this weekend, Joe said his appearance ""was beneficial for the whole of social media"". He previously said he hoped going on Strictly would ""build a relationship"" between vloggers and broadcasters. Joe was speaking at VidCon London. But that transition from social media to telly is not one all are capable of making. ""They need help,"" Lucy Loveridge told Radio 1 Newsbeat at the convention. Lucy's the head of talent at Gleam Futures - the UK's largest agency for online stars. ""They've been in their bedroom [vlogging] and need a bit of coaching,"" she explains. ""That investment is necessary."" Recently there's been an increase in traditional media booking online stars: Zoe Sugg (Joe's sister) took part in The Great British Bake Off for Comic Relief and Trisha Paytas appeared on Celebrity Big Brother. BBC Radio 5 live also hosted commentary of the boxing match between YouTubers Logal Paul and KSI.  Holly Horne, who has more than 13m followers on social media app TikTok, says she's starting to be approached more by execs.  ""Life is starting to get crazy,"" she explains. ""Since I've blown up over the past few months there's been offers and I've said yes to everything."" The 22-year-old from Guernsey, known online as HollyH, posts comedy lip syncs and is the most followed Brit on the platform.  ""I've had a couple of meetings over the past few days which have been insane,"" she tells Newsbeat.  When asked if she'll be taking part in this year's Strictly Come Dancing, Holly smiles and says: ""Joe Sugg's manager is my manager so crazy stuff is going to happen."" Holly also said she'd like to move into movies and is working on a CBBC series. It's the same on the other side of the Atlantic too. ""We're getting opportunities because of YouTube,"" the Merrell Twins tell Newsbeat.  The 22-year-old sisters post comedy sketches and music covers to their four million subscribers.  ""I'm not trying to brag but it's crazy the numbers we can bring,"" Veronica explains. ""Traditional media see the influence we have and want to get viewers."" ""Because of YouTube"" they've just landed a role in upcoming comedy film Limited Partners starring Salma Hayek and Tiffany Haddish. ""It gave us validation for the role because of the success our channel."" Younger audiences spend more time online than they do watching TV or films, with only 10% of young people getting ""almost all"" their TV programmes through a TV screen. But, as Lucy Loveridge explains, there's a limit to what online stars can bring to TV.  ""There's no T4 anymore and that was such a testing ground for finding and developing new talent."" Riyadh Khalaf, a YouTuber who's made documentaries for BBC Three and hosts a podcast for Radio 1, says: ""I only went on YouTube because I couldn't get a job on TV."" He says TV execs started to take notice when online sites started writing about him but ""they didn't know where to put me.""  ""We are now proving to traditional media that if you develop us and train us we can be just as good as Davina McCall, Alan Carr or Graham Norton.

Hawkish,Japanese yen slips to 24-year low against dollar,2024-09-25,2022-09-02,By Annabelle  Liang,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-62762138,"The Japanese yen has declined to its lowest level against the US dollar since August 1998, prompting the government to weigh action. The boost in the dollar stems from data suggesting the labour market of the world's biggest economy is recovering. On Thursday, the currency pair breached the key psychological level of 140 yen against the US dollar. While many central banks in Asia have hiked the cost of borrowing to mirror the US, Japan has not followed suit. The Bank of Japan has maintained its ultra-low interest rates to support economic recovery, and this is one of the reasons the yen has fallen in value against the US dollar and other major currencies. Higher interest rates tend to attract foreign investment. That increases demand for and the value of currencies from countries with higher interest rates. A US Labor Department report on Thursday showed that the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell to a two-month low, suggesting the jobs market is recovering post-pandemic.  This sparked buying interest in the US dollar which drove it to a fresh high against the Japanese currency, at 140.23 yen. But it was not the only currency affected by dollar strength.  The British pound slid by around 5% for the first time since October 2016. The US dollar gained momentum earlier in the week, after Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell said the US central bank would continue to raise interest rates in the coming months. Mr Powell added that the Fed could keep rates high ""for some time"" at an annual conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. ""It's a strong USD story this week after the hawkish Jackson Hole forum"", Philip Wee, senior currency economist at DBS Bank, told the BBC. ""From here, more Asian central banks are ready to hike, some larger than usual. This should help offset some of the pressures from the strong USD,"" he added. On Friday, Japanese Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki said the government would take ""appropriate"" action to address the yen's decline. ""Excessive, disorderly currency moves could have a negative impact on the economy and financial conditions,"" Mr Suzuki told a press conference. However, Dwyfor Evans of State Street Global Markets told the BBC that measures to lift the yen ""could prove futile"" because of the gap between interest rates in Japan and much of the rest of the world. The Bank of Japan last intervened in currency markets in 2011, after an earthquake and tsunami triggered the Fukushima nuclear crisis.  At midday Friday in Asia, the yen has continued to slip, trading around 140.35 against the dollar."

Hawkish,Pound heads for two-year low as holidays begin,2024-09-25,2019-07-09,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48926232,"The pound is heading for two-year lows against the dollar as markets react to continuing Brexit uncertainty and signs that the UK economy is slowing. The currency fell sharply after data showed slowing sales at UK retailers and economists forecast a contraction in the economy in the second quarter. Against the dollar, the pound fell below $1.25 and was close to its lowest level since April 2017. The pound was also at a six-month low against the euro at just above €1.11. With the holiday season getting underway, it means travellers from the UK will getting fewer dollars and euros for their pounds. Sterling has been swayed by uncertainty in the aftermath of the EU referendum, but has been more stable in recent months because of confidence about the UK economy. However, recent economic surveys have suggested that the economy may now be weakening and Jane Foley, head of foreign exchange strategy at Rabobank, said this was being factored into the market. ""The economic picture is not particularly pretty,"" she said. The pound fell 0.5% against the dollar at $1.2455, marking the lowest point for it since April 2017, excluding a brief ""flash fall"" in January this year. Back in May, the pound had been trading at around $1.27. Last week, a survey suggested the UK's manufacturing sector contracted at the fastest pace for more than six years. On Tuesday, figures from the British Retail Consortium showed average sales growth slowed to 0.6% in the 12 months to June, the weakest reading since its records began in 1995. Ms Foley also cited a survey by Bloomberg which showed that economists are expecting the economy to contract in the second quarter - for the first time since 2012. An update on the UK economy is due on Wednesday when growth data for the three-month period to May will be released, and economists polled by Reuters expect growth of 0.1%. That would be slower than the 0.5% rate seen in the first quarter of the year. The market is also focusing on the Conservative leadership contest.  Under Theresa May's premiership, the market had thought the chances of a no-deal were slim, but Ms Foley said that was not the expectation if Boris Johnson wins the leadership battle. ""That's what the market is worried about,"" she said. Neil Mellor, currency strategist at Bank of New York Mellon, said that another factor at play was a strengthening in the dollar ahead of testimony by the head of the US central bank. This was helping to push the pound lower. Jerome Powell, chair of the Federal Reserve, testifies to the US Congress on Wednesday. Mr Mellor said he could provide a more hawkish tone - meaning interest rate cuts were less likely - than previously expected."

Hawkish,Russia plans prolonged drone attacks - Zelensky,2024-09-25,2023-01-02,By Matt Murphy,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-64146813,"Ukraine's president says Russia is planning a protracted campaign of drone attacks in a bid to demoralise Ukraine.  Volodymyr Zelensky said he had received intelligence reports suggesting that Moscow would launch the attacks using Iranian-made Shahed drones.  It comes after Ukraine carried out a strike that it said killed hundreds of Russian soldiers in the Donbas region. In an extremely rare admission of battlefield losses, Russia said the attack killed 63 of its troops.  Speaking from Kyiv in his nightly address, Mr Zelensky said Russia planned to ""exhaust"" Ukraine with a prolonged wave of drone attacks. ""We must ensure - and we will do everything for this - that this goal of terrorists fails like all the others,"" he said. ""Now is the time when everyone involved in the protection of the sky should be especially attentive."" Russian drone strikes on Ukraine appear to have increased in recent days, with Moscow launching attacks on cities and power stations across the country over the past three nights.  Correspondents say that as well as the strain on Ukraine's military - which has to track and intercept the drones - there is also an attritional impact on the civilian population which lives with the uncertainty, fear and disruption the attacks cause across the country. Russia has been targeting Ukraine's energy infrastructure for several months, destroying power stations and plunging millions into darkness during the country's freezing winter. Mr Zelensky said Ukrainian air defences had already shot down over 80 Iranian-made drones in the opening days of 2023.  Elsewhere, Ukraine has confirmed it carried out a strike in the occupied region of Donetsk, which it earlier claimed killed 400 Russian troops. Russian officials contested the figure, saying only 63 troops were killed. Neither claim has been verified, and access to the site is restricted.  However, some of those killed and wounded came from Russia's south-western Samara region, according to governor Dmitry Azarov, who urged families to contact a hotline or local military offices. Families laid wreaths in the region's main cities of Samara and Tolyatti on Tuesday to remember those killed. The Ukrainian attack, thought to have taken place as Russians celebrated the new year, hit a vocational school building in the city of Makiivka, where Russian soldiers were stationed. It is extremely rare for Moscow to confirm any battlefield casualties.  But this was such a deadly attack, says the BBC's Russia editor Steve Rosenberg, that staying silent probably wasn't an option. It is the highest number of deaths acknowledged by Moscow in a single incident since the war began 10 months ago.  In a statement on Monday, Russia's defence ministry said Ukrainian forces fired six rockets using the US-made Himars rocket system at a building housing Russian troops. Two of them were shot down, it added.  Igor Girkin, a Russian nationalist commentator, earlier said that hundreds had been killed and wounded, although the exact number was unknown because of the large number still missing.  The building itself was ""almost completely destroyed"", he said. He added that the victims were mainly mobilised troops - that is, recent conscripts, rather than those who chose to fight. He also said ammunition was stored in the same building as the soldiers, making the damage worse. ""Almost all of the military equipment was also destroyed, which stood right next to the building without any disguise whatsoever,"" he wrote on Telegram.  Girkin is a well-known military blogger, who led Russian-backed separatists when they occupied of large parts of eastern Ukraine in 2014. He was recently found guilty of murder for his part in the shooting down of flight MH17.  Despite his hawkish stance, he regularly criticises the Russian military leadership and their tactics. Several Russian lawmakers have also strongly criticised military commanders over the attack, saying commanders must be held to account for allowing troops to concentrate in an unprotected building within range of Ukrainian rockets, where ammunition may also have been stored.  Sergei Mironov - a former chairman of the Russian Senate - said it was obvious than neither intelligence nor air defence had worked properly.  According to the Ukrainian military's earlier statement, 300 were wounded in addition to the estimated 400 killed. Ukraine's army claims, almost daily, to have killed dozens, sometimes hundreds, of soldiers in attacks.  A later statement from the Ukrainian military's general staff said ""up to 10 units of enemy military equipment"" were ""destroyed and damaged"" in the strikes, and that ""the losses of personnel of the occupiers are being specified"". The US-based Institute for the Study of War said the defence ministry in Moscow was probably trying to deflect the blame for the security lapse on to Russia's proxy authorities in Donetsk.  Local security officials told Tass news agency that the cause of the strike was that Ukrainian forces had been able to detect the use of Russian mobile phones by servicemen arriving in the building."
Hawkish,"All the Doctors, from Hartnell to Whittaker",2024-09-25,2017-07-16,By Neil Smith,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-40585673,"Doctor Who's Peter Capaldi has passed on his sonic screwdriver to Jodie Whittaker who becomes the 13th doctor and first woman to take on the role of television's famous Time Lord. She follows a distinguished line-up of thespian (male) talent that stretches all the way back to the sci-fi favourite's first episode in 1963. William Hartnell was the first actor to play the Doctor on television, appearing in the BBC show from 1963 to 1966. Hartnell, who died in 1975, had previously appeared in TV's The Army Game and Carry On Sergeant, the first Carry On film, in 1958. While Hartnell was playing the Doctor on television, Peter Cushing could be found playing him on film in Dr Who and the Daleks, in which Roy Castle co-starred. That 1965 film and its 1966 follow-up, Daleks - Invasion Earth: 2150 A.D., depicted the Doctor as a human scientist rather than a time-travelling Gallifreyan and are not considered part of the Doctor Who timeline. When ill health forced Hartnell to relinquish the role, the Doctor regenerated - for the first time - into Patrick Troughton. Memorably scruffy and eccentric, Troughton spent three years travelling time and space before stepping down in 1969. When the raffish Jon Pertwee became the third Doctor, he also became the first to be seen on television in colour. His tenure, which ran from 1970 to 1974, saw the Time Lord exiled to Earth and working with Unit, aka the United Nations Intelligence Taskforce. Pertwee's time with the show also saw the first of the popular ensemble stories in which previous Doctors appear alongside the current one. Broadcast over December 1972 and January 1973, The Three Doctors saw him joined by Patrick Troughton and William Hartnell in what would be the latter's final acting engagement. When Pertwee moved on in 1974, Tom Baker moved in - and would become the longest-serving Doctor to date. Deep-voiced, curly-haired and eternally long of scarf, his seven years in the Tardis earned him legions of fans who were delighted anew in 2013 when he popped up at the end of a 50th anniversary special. When Baker finally stepped down from the role in 1981, his shoes were filled by the fresh-faced Peter Davison. The boyish actor spent three years as the Fifth Doctor before taking his leave at the end of the show's 21st series. Davison's tenure coincided with Doctor Who's 20th anniversary, celebrated by a feature-length special that saw him joined by Jon Pertwee and Patrick Troughton. The First Doctor also made an appearance, with Richard Hurndall filling in for the late William Hartnell. Tom Baker opted not to return for The Five Doctors, which covered over his absence by incorporating material from one of the actor's unbroadcast adventures. Similar subterfuge was required for this 1983 photo shoot, which saw Hurndall, Davison, Pertwee and Troughton joined by an unconvincing Baker mannequin. Davison's departure opened the door for another Baker to take controls of the Doctor's time-travelling police box in 1984. Colin Baker (no relation of Tom's) spent less than three years in the role, with his appearances limited further by an 18-month hiatus in production. Though Baker had limited time to enjoy the Tardis, he did get the chance to meet one of his predecessors when Patrick Troughton returned - for the third time - in 1985. The Two Doctors marked Troughton's final reprise of his signature role. Some years later, his sons David and Michael would both make Doctor Who appearances. Scottish actor Sylvester McCoy took over from Colin Baker in 1987 and played the Doctor until the show's axing in 1989. Michael Grade - the controller of BBC One at the time - was no fan of the programme, which was looking increasingly threadbare and cheap-looking in the face of glossier cinema fare. Some feel, though, that this period in the show's evolution has been harshly judged. An attempt was made to revive Doctor Who in 1996 with a TV film that saw McCoy regenerate into Paul McGann on American soil. It was hoped the special would spawn a TV series but it never materialised, making McGann's tenure the shortest of all the Doctors. In 2005 Doctor Who regenerated into the ambitious, well-financed property it is today. It also introduced a new Doctor in the form of Christopher Eccleston. To the disappointment of many, the Salford-born actor chose to make only one series of the rebooted show. His departure was confirmed only days after his debut episode was broadcast. Eccleston's exit saw David Tennant join the show, with his first full episode - The Christmas Invasion - shown on BBC One on Christmas Day 2005. Tennant's amiable style and enthusiasm made him a popular choice for the role, which he finally relinquished on the first day of 2010. The spate of junior Doctors continued with the casting of Matt Smith, who was just 27 when he made his debut as the Time Lord's 11th incarnation. His four years in the role, which coincided with Doctor Who's 50th anniversary, saw the programme both maintain and bolster its renewed popularity. Doctor Who's 50th anniversary in 2013 was marked by The Day of the Doctor, a feature-length special in which Matt Smith's Time Lord was joined by David Tennant's version of the character. The Day of the Doctor also introduced a previously unknown incarnation of the Doctor, known as The War Doctor and played by Sir John Hurt. The character rejected referring to himself as 'The Doctor' and is not considered to have the same status as his fellow TV Time Lords. Peter Capaldi was no stranger to the Doctor Who universe when he was cast as the Doctor in 2013. A lifelong fan of the show, he appeared in an episode of the programme in 2008 and also had a role in its spin-off Torchwood. His hawkish features brought a new intensity, and maturity, to the Tardis from the moment his first full episode was broadcast in August 2014. Capaldi's most recent adventure saw him briefly joined by the ""original"" Doctor, played on this occasion by David Bradley. Bradley will return in this year's Doctor Who Christmas special. Bradley's appearance was a pleasing one for Whovians after his role as William Hartnell in An Adventure in Space and Time, a 2013 dramatisation of the show's early years. Jodie Whittaker has been named as the 13th Doctor and will be the first woman to play the role - if one discounts Joanna Lumley, who briefly played the Doctor in a 1999 Comic Relief sketch. Whittaker will make her debut on the sci-fi show this Christmas when Peter Capaldi regenerates. Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

Hawkish,Musician celebrates 90 years in show business,2024-09-25,2023-07-29,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-oxfordshire-66327570,"A musician is celebrating 90 years in show business by doing what he loves best - playing live music.  Alan Grahame, from Henley On Thames, turned 96 on 23 July and played at his local pub to celebrate.  Over his long career the multi-instrumentalist has toured with world-famous stars including Shirley Bassey, Tom Jones, and Engelbert Humperdinck. Mr Grahame said: ""I am planning on playing until I am at least a hundred years old.""   Despite his age, he still plays the vibraphone and other kinds of percussion, joining bands for live performances all over the UK. He started his career in 1933 playing in seaside shows in Dawlish, Devon.  Before signing up to the Army during World War Two, he joined other musicians entertaining the troops in south London and Surrey.  After the war ended, he started his own band with other soldiers. Gaining success Mr Grahame also appeared regularly on Top of the Pops, Parkinson, Play School and starred in in the long running live ITV show Lunchbox. When Tom Jones worked on his famous hit It's Not Unusual, Mr Grahame was right beside him.  He said: ""We didn't know who it was, we were just musicians and of course the rest is history. ""This young guy came in all hair and Jack-the-lad, and we laid about four tracks. ""I was very fortunate. I did the Albert Hall with Shirley every concert she did and then we had several tours abroad.  ""In those days it was a big orchestra with live strings rather than a synthesizer or keyboard."" He added: ""Live music keeps me going. I love nothing better than being on stage and giving my all as an entertainer."" In August 'All Bluff and Porterage', a series of films celebrating Mr Grahame's life will be released. Follow BBC South on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

Hawkish,Barge with legs used for sea wall work,2024-09-25,2020-11-10,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-54893599,"A barge on legs will help construct an £80m sea wall to protect a rail line previously destroyed by storms. The eight-legged, self-contained walking barge, known as a Wavewalker, is the only one of its kind in Europe. Work at Dawlish, south Devon, marks the first time this type of barge has been used to maintain the UK rail network. In 2014, a storm caused a stretch of the coastal railway to collapse into the sea - cutting off the south west peninsular from the rest of the line. The jack-up barge can be raised or lowered for work in challenging environments and allows workers to operate safely and for longer, engineers said. Huw Jones, from civil engineering firm BAM Nuttall who will operate the barge, said the railway line was ""enormously exposed to the worst weather that the English Channel can produce"".  He said: ""Working in this environment requires imaginative solutions and innovative thinking and our use of the Wavewalker is a great example of that. ""The jack-up barge allows us to work safely on the foundations of a new sea-wall on a 24-7 basis, regardless of tides."" Network Rail said the construction of the new sea wall will take around two years to complete"
Hawkish,Thousands apply for Hawking service ballot,2024-09-25,2018-05-10,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-44066637,"About 12,000 people from more than 50 countries have applied for tickets to a thanksgiving service for Prof Stephen Hawking within 24 hours of a public ballot being launched. The service for the theoretical physicist, who died in March aged 76, will be held at Westminster Abbey in London on 15 June. His ashes will be interred between Sir Isaac Newton and Charles Darwin. The ballot for up to 1,000 places opened on Wednesday.  People from as far away as Canada and the US, India, China, Bolivia, and the tiny islands of Tuvalu in the South Pacific have asked to attend. The ballot was launched by The Stephen Hawking Foundation at 00:01 BST on Wednesday. Hawking's ashes to be interred at abbey Stephen Hawking service ballot opens Within four hours more than 1,000 applications had been lodged and the numbers have been rising steadily, including from 227 UK schools, which are allowed to bring up to four pupils plus a teacher on one application. The foundation said it set up a dedicated server to cope with the expected high online demand for places at the service next month. Professor Hawking died after a long battle with motor neurone disease. Thousands lined the streets of his home city for his funeral on 31 March. The popularity of Prof Hawking's life and work has caused problems before when demand for his PhD thesis intermittently crashed part of Cambridge University's website as physics fans flocked to read his work when it was published online in October. Successful applicants for places at the service will be chosen randomly after the ballot closes on Tuesday."
Hawkish,Planned hospital closure could face second review,2024-09-25,2023-03-22,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-65037473,"Another review into the planned closure of a community hospital in Devon is a step closer. Teignmouth Hospital, the first to be built by the NHS, is due to close, with services moving to a new £8m health centre in the town and to Dawlish Hospital  The closure of the hospital in Mill Lane, opened in 1954, is part of a NHS plan to modernise services in the area. Devon's health scrutiny committee is to investigate the possible impacts, It will then decide whether to refer the proposals back to the health secretary for a second time, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. It did so in 2021, unhappy with a lack of consultation over the hospital's future, but then health secretary Sajid Javid asked for a review by a panel of independent experts, who decided the NHS Devon Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) consultation had been ""adequate,"" However, the panel identified ""lessons to be learned for both parties,"" adding the NHS must engage with the community to ""determine the future"" of the hospital. A campaign to save it has continued, and Teignbridge District Council last month agreed to write to current health secretary Steve Barclay to review the closure again. Councillors claim there is much more pressure on the health system since the original decision, made pre-pandemic, while the League of Friends of Teignmouth Hospital has pledged £1m to refurbish it as a recovery hospital. The NHS said its plan was supported by more than 60% of respondents to a 2020 consultation.  But at the county council scrutiny committee meeting on Tuesday, several speakers and councillors urged another government review. Local resident Vivian Wilson said: ""It's 21 years since the closure of one of the two wards at Teignmouth Hospital. It is six years since the other one was closed. The loss of those two wards is now a primary cause of bed-blocking at Torbay. ""Prior to that, Teignmouth Hospital was the perfect pit-stop for patients between Torbay Hospital and home."" Ms Wilson mentioned specific cases of ""poor aftercare"" as a result, later adding: ""This is why we've been fighting to save Teignmouth Hospital - a valued outpost to Torbay since 1954 and it should be again."" Afterwards, a spokesperson for the NHS in Devon said: ""The way we provide care in the Teignmouth and Dawlish area is very successful and receives very positive feedback from patients and carers. ""Our model of providing care gives us more capacity than a rehabilitation ward would - when we consulted with local people in 2020, we estimated that we could treat four times as many people in their own homes as we could in a rehabilitation ward in Teignmouth Hospital with the same investment.""

Hawkish,'Bank of England executive must quit over breach',2024-09-25,2019-12-19,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50849479,"A former member of the Bank of England has called for the resignation of its chief operating officer after it emerged an audio feed of sensitive information had been leaked to traders. The Bank admitted one of its suppliers had ""misused"" the feed to give hedge funds early access to information. Danny Blanchflower, who previously served on the rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee, said Joanna Place should step down following the breach. The Bank of England refused to comment. Many Bank press conferences are broadcast via video, but there is also a back-up audio feed in case of problems. The audio is available between five and eight seconds before the video. It meant that high-speed financial traders had access to the words of Governor Mark Carney and his officials before their remarks were more widely broadcast. Ms Place reports directly to Mr Carney and has had responsibility for information security since July 2017. Mr Blanchflower said: ""The question I ask is did the chief operating officer at the Bank of England know that access was being sold? If so, she should resign. And if she didn't know she should resign as well. ""I just don't know how her position is maintained because this could have created a lot of harm. People could have made a lot of money.""  The Bank of England said it had disabled the audio supplier's access. The hijacking of the audio feed, first reported in the Times, gave an advantage to high-speed traders, such as currency speculators, who can make millions of pounds on tiny market moves.  Comments from Bank officials about market sensitive matters such as interest rate decisions can affect the value of sterling and other market assets within fractions of a second. The Times said it understood that the eavesdropping on the press conferences had been happening at least since the beginning of this year.  Mr Blanchflower said the ""astonishing"" revelation was ""a stain"" on Mr Carney as he prepares to step down as Governor on 31 January.  Commenting on who could be in line to replace Mr Carney, Mr Blanchflower said his ""old graduate school room mate"" Gerard Lyons, who was Prime Minister Boris Johnson's former chief economist when he was Mayor of London, may ""rise to the top of pack"".  The Bank of England said the leak ""was wholly unacceptable use of the audio feed"" and the way hedge funds were allowed to make use of it was ""without the Bank's knowledge or consent, and is being investigated further"".  The matter has been referred to the market regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, which told the BBC it was ""looking at the issue"". Being able to hear the press conference early would provide an unfair advantage. Interest rates, economic guidance, and the financial health of banks and the markets are frequently discussed at the press conferences. The Bank sets rates eight times a year and holds a press conference on four of those occasions. A report on financial stability comes out twice, which also includes a press conference.  All of this is broadcast on video provided by Bloomberg, which is shared to other news outlets.  The company that provides the audio feed, which is separate from the video feed, has not been identified.  A spokesperson from Bloomberg confirmed to the BBC that the company does not provide the audio. ""Bloomberg provides a distinct and independent video feed for the BoE's press conferences. This is completely separate to the backup audio feed.""  The pronouncements of central bank chiefs can sound like boring technical gobbledy-gook. But every word, every nuance, is carefully studied by financial markets for the slightest hint about the Bank's intentions and can cause big movements in the value of the pound and government bonds. So getting wind of any potential future changes, even a few seconds ahead of the rest of the market, could be extremely valuable. Computerised trading programs can execute thousands of transactions a second, so the four-to-eight second advantage enjoyed by those traders accessing the back-up audio feed is a vast amount of time in terms of market movements.  The Bank of England is usually very careful in managing the dissemination of sensitive information and the Bank was keen to stress that the information breach did not apply to the release of decisions on interest rates - just the press conferences afterwards. But those press conferences can - and do - move markets so this is still an embarrassing admission.  The Times said it had seen documents revealing how the service was sold on to traders. The supply cost between £2,500 and £5,000 each press conference for each client in addition to a subscription fee.  It is unclear whether the leaked audio feed was used by traditional traders at their desks to steal a march on rivals, or whether algorithm-driven software, that can conduct thousands of transactions a second, could be used to exploit those few seconds advantage. Hypothetically a computer program could be designed to pick out key words from the Bank Governor's comments and trade on them. But central bankers are notoriously euphemistic. ""[Early access] would be more important to a traditional voice trader or hedge fund,"" says Malcolm Baker, co-Founder at FX FWD, a trading firm.  ""Central bankers can speak in language that is hard to understand and there is a lot that's implied. It's like old Elizabethan language and can be misleading. A trader like me just wants to understand - is it hawkish? Or dovish?"" The Bank has not named the audio supplier, but market intelligence firm Statisma has posted a denial that it offers its customers information not available to the public. Statisma, operating under the same management as a production firm called Encoded Media, advertises on Twitter a service where traders can hear central bank announcements first.  Press conferences from the European Central Bank, the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of Canada were also on offer to trading firms. Traders signed up to Statisma's service receive an email detailing the speeches with dial in numbers.  In a response to several calls made from the BBC and other media outlets, it posted on its website this statement: ""We DO NOT carry embargoed information and we DO NOT release information without it first being made available to the public"". An ECB spokesman said the central bank moved to address possible issues with audio broadcasts in September, effectively delaying the feed. ""Since September this year the ECB offers a low latency audio feed for each monetary policy press conference to address exactly the issues that were in the news today.  ""Therefore, it doesn't make any sense for anyone to use commercially offered solutions because the solution we offer is the fastest option available and it is free for everyone,"" the spokesman said."
Hawkish,How a ship where hundreds drowned became a piece of art,2024-09-25,2019-05-15,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-48252938,"If the purpose of art is to elicit a strong reaction then exhibiting a shipwreck at one of the world's biggest art exhibitions has passed the test. But has it overstepped the boundaries of taste? Critics have hit out at the use of the hull of the ship, in which hundreds of migrants drowned, at the Venice Biennale. The fishing vessel sank on its trip from Libya to Italy in 2015 and at least 700 people, many from Africa, died as a result. Swiss-Icelandic artist Christoph Büchel brought the boat to the Biennale which opened to the public at the weekend.  He said that his exhibit, Barca Nostra (Our Boat), was intended to be ""a monument to contemporary migration"". It was the Mediterranean's deadliest shipwreck in living memory and happened in the middle of the European migrant crisis, which peaked in 2016 with an estimated 5,096 people dying or going missing trying to cross the Mediterranean - the highest number ever recorded. Some art critics have been scathing in their attacks on Büchel's use of the ship.  In the Guardian, Adrian Searle calls it a vulgar gesture. ""I found Büchel's appropriation of the boat in which so many migrants lost their lives a vile and mawkish spectacle in the context of the Biennale. ""The best one can say of Büchel's intervention is that it brings us face to face with death. Biennale visitors pause to take selfies in front of it."" How people interact with the boat has appeared to alarm observers. A tweet showing a cafe next to the boat is described as ""peak art world"" by Martin Herbert. Matthew Mpoke Bigg from the UN refugee agency points out that people were ""sipping aperitifs at a nearby cafe in the sunshine, some apparently ignorant of the horror of what happened there"". Calling it the ""most troubling"" exhibit at the Biennale,  Cristina Ruiz in the Art Newspaper gives an explanation why art lovers may not be acting in the sombre way some might expect. ""Art can and should deal with the most pressing issues of our time and Büchel's boat would easily be the most important inclusion in [the] Biennale if it were not for the fact that Büchel has chosen to provide no labels or signs near the rusting vessel.  ""It is true that there is information about the boat and its history in the Biennale catalogue but only a small proportion of visitors purchase this.  ""So many, if not most, exhibition goers will eat and drink in the shadow of this ship with absolutely no idea of the tragedy that unfolded there."" Who died in the 18 April 2015 shipwreck? Context is everything, it seems for these critics.  One detail of context to be considered is the motivation of the curator of the Venice Biennale, explains BBC arts editor Will Gompertz. He points out that curator Ralph Rugoff  had already said art should be ""entertaining"".  But the critics went further, starting to question the purpose of art in our society at this point.  ""Horrified"" by the exhibit, Stephen Pritchard wrote in his blog Colouring in Culture that the artist was exploiting the tragedy: ""To see the art world fawn over a shipwreck that was a grave to so many people is utterly abhorrent. ""To exhibit it as a 'relic' or 'monument' such a tragic loss of life is to reify, commodify and totally exploit the lives of not only those who lost their lives but migration itself."" While Yasmin Alibhai-Brown says in the I newspaper that the exhibit is reflective of a worrying trend in the art world - an exhibit that ""lacks integrity"". ""Büchel simply used the dispossessed on the high seas to flaunt his artistic and political nihilism"". For her, it was not the people taking selfies and having picnics next to the tragic artefact that stood out. Instead, it was what was not there that led her to conclude the exhibit was ""barbarous"": ""The dead souls are not there, not even as black silhouettes. They are, one surmises, unimportant to the 'provocative' Swiss-Icelandic artist, Christopher Büchel"". Büchel himself declined to comment when contacted by the BBC.  Instead he said everything he wanted to say was in the original press release.  In this he argues that Barca Nostra is ""a relic of a human tragedy but also a monument to contemporary migration"". ""The vessel has become a symbolic object, dedicated not only to the victims of the tragic event in 2015 and the people involved in its recovery, but to our mutual responsibility representing the collective policies and politics that create such wrecks."""
Hawkish,Kim Cattrall suggests SATC replacements,2024-09-25,2018-01-19,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-42745157,"When Kim Cattrall ruled out appearing in Sex and the City 3, saying her relationship with her co-stars was ""toxic"", it looked like there was no prospect of the film ever being made. But the actress, who played Samantha Jones, has now suggested two women who could play her part instead. She endorsed Tiffany Haddish from Girls Trip and Modern Family's Sofia Vergara.  They are among the ""many fabulous actresses to choose from that will make Samantha their own"", Cattrall said. The Liverpool-born actress played the PR executive in two films, as well as all six series of Sex and the City.  She denied that her decision to turn down the third film was due to pay or ""diva"" demands.  Her latest comments came after Sarah Jessica Parker, who starred as Carrie in the long-running comedy-drama about a group of New York friends, suggested another instalment could still happen - without Cattrall. ""You know, who knows,"" she told Ellen DeGeneres on her talk show. ""Perhaps, we'll find a way. Right now I don't know."" She also suggested DeGeneres herself could take the role of Samantha - to which Cattrall replied on Twitter with two thumbs up emojis, saying: ""She'd be fabulous."" Cattrall went on to say that fellow talk show host Oprah Winfrey was her first love and she'd also enjoy seeing ""goddesses"" Haddish or Vergara play the part.

Hawkish,Shinzo Abe: The legacy of Japan's longest-serving PM,2024-09-25,2020-08-28,By Yuko Kato & Zubaidah Abdul Jalil,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-53938094," Shinzo Abe, Japan's longest-serving prime minister, was known for his hawkish foreign policy and a signature economic strategy that popularly came to be known as ""Abenomics"". A highly popular, and a highly controversial politician, the 67-year-old Abe led the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to victory twice.  His shocking death harkens back to images of the violent days in pre-war Japanese politics, when political assassinations were, if not commonplace, not unheard of. A string of political assassinations were part of Japan's march towards WWII. As a popular and divisive politician, it was part of his trade to stir up strong emotions among the masses. Abe knew from childhood that those masses are not always friendly, and that he had to fight back against criticism. Abe's first stint as prime minister was brief - for a little over a year starting in 2006 - and controversial. But he made a surprising political comeback in 2012, staying in power until 2020 when he resigned for health reasons.  Japan was in a recession when he began his second term and his economic policy was credited with helping return growth to a faltering economy.  He oversaw Japan's recovery from a massive earthquake and tsunami in Tohoku in 2011, which killed nearly 20,000 people and led to a meltdown of the Fukushima nuclear reactors.  Abe also had his unexpected moments, such as popping up dressed as Super Mario at the Rio Olympics closing ceremony ahead of the 2020 Tokyo Games.  When he stepped down after weeks of speculation, he revealed he had suffered a relapse of ulcerative colitis.  He was succeeded by close party ally Yoshihide Suga, but was still seen as a powerful figure in Japanese politics.  As the son of former foreign minister Shintaro Abe and grandson of former prime minister Nobusuke Kishi, Abe was born into a political dynasty. He felt his mission was to continue the task of his ancestors - to make Japan strong, great, and a force to be reckoned with on the international stage. He looked up to Kishi, who strove to strengthen Japan's economic rule over China and Manchuria during World War II, and then was instrumental in creating the political dominance of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). Abe's aversion to protesters may have its roots in how his revered grandfather was driven from power, following a huge anti-government protest in 1960.  Abe was first elected to parliament in 1993, and in 2005 he became chief cabinet secretary. His rise to the top came swiftly as he became Japan's youngest post-war prime minister in 2006.   But a series of scandals - including the government's loss of pension records, affecting about 50 million claims - hit his administration hard.   A heavy loss for the LDP followed in upper house elections in July 2007, and in September of that year he resigned due to ulcerative colitis. But then in 2012, Abe returned as prime minister, saying that he had overcome the disease with the help of medication. He was subsequently re-elected in 2014 and 2017, becoming Japan's longest-serving prime minister.  His popularity fluctuated, but he remained largely unchallenged due to his influence in the LDP, which amended its rules to allow him to serve a third term as party leader. With his hawkish stance on defence and foreign policy, Abe repeated the importance of being an equal ally and partner with the US and other Western powers.  This fed into his long-held goal of revising Japan's post-war pacifist constitution so it could finally become a ""normal country"". Conservatives see the constitution - drafted by the US - as a reminder of the humiliating defeat of Japanese troops in WWII. The influence of his grandfather also fed into Abe's wariness of China emerging as the dominant force in Asia, reinforcing his conviction that Japan needed to pull its weight and become a military force to defend itself. These nationalistic and militaristic platforms were deeply divisive, horrifying parts of the population who cherish the pacifist constitution, while giving voice and even credibility to those blatant revisionist and nationalist groups and sentiments which for a long time in post-war Japan used to be a minority and only spoken in hushed tones. His nationalist views have often raised tensions with China and South Korea, particularly after his 2013 visit to Tokyo's Yasukuni shrine, a controversial site linked to Japan's militarism before and during WWII. Repeated visits also irked left-wing factions in Japan, who viewed it as an attempt by Abe to whitewash Japanese atrocities during the war.  In 2015, he pushed for the right to collective self-defence, enabling Japan to mobilise troops overseas to defend itself and allies under attack. Despite opposition from Japan's neighbours and even the Japanese public, Japan's parliament approved this controversial change. His larger goal of revising the constitution to formally recognise Japan's military remains unfulfilled, and continues to be a divisive topic in the country.  He was also unable to secure the return of what Japan refers to as the Northern Territories - a chain of disputed islands off the northern prefecture of Hokkaido that are claimed by both Japan and Russia.  Abe's rapport with former US president Donald Trump was credited with shielding Japan from crippling US-led trade tariffs, and having to fork out more money to support the presence of US troops in the country.  He spearheaded ""Abenomics"" policies, a comprehensive policy package aimed at making Japan strong by reviving the economy from the doldrums of deflation, while maintaining fiscal discipline.  The popularity of these policies led to Abe and the LDP's return to power in 2012. But his efforts faced a major challenge when the country again went into recession in the spring of 2020. That and other slowdowns raised questions about the effectiveness of his approach. Abe's popularity was further hit by concerns over his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic. Critics believe his campaigns aimed at boosting domestic tourism contributed to a resurgence of infections. They also say other promises of Abenomics  - such as empowering women in the workforce, tackling nepotism and changing unhealthy work cultures - remained unfulfilled.  Internationally, he has been credited with holding the Trans-Pacific Partnership - a massive trade agreement between 11 countries - together, following an abrupt withdrawal by the US under Mr Trump's administration.  Abe's resignation announcement led to an internal struggle among LDP factions, because he declined to name a successor. He was eventually succeeded by Yoshihide Suga. But Abe continued to hold sway over domestic politics in Japan, even after Suga was replaced by current prime minister Fumio Kishida.  On 8 July, Abe was in the southern city of Nara campaigning on behalf of a candidate running for Japan's upper house.  He was delivering a speech when he was shot by a gunman - a 41-year-old who is believed to be a former member of the Self-Defense Force, Japan's equivalent of a navy.  According to NHK and other news reports, the suspect said he was ""dissatisfied with Abe"" but that ""it has nothing to with political grudges"".  Abe was conscious when taken to hospital, but died later from his injuries.  He leaves his wife, Akie, a Japanese radio DJ who he married in 1987.  Additional reporting by Andreas Illmer"
Hawkish,Who is Alabama Senate victor Doug Jones?,2024-09-25,2017-12-12,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-42321396,"Alabama is a deeply conservative place, as its voting record amply demonstrates.  Until Doug Jones came along the state hadn't picked a Democrat for the US Senate since 1992 - and even that man, Richard Shelby, went on to defect to the Republicans. But on 12 December Mr Jones, 63, painted the old red seat blue when voters chose him to fill Attorney General Jeff Sessions's former berth. So what do we know about the man who fought and beat Republican Roy Moore for the heart of Dixie? When Mr Jones beat seven other candidates to win the Democratic primary in August 2017, it was the entry pass to a seriously tough fight. But he would argue he's used to those. Gordon Douglas Jones, known as Doug, studied political science at the University of Alabama, followed by law at the state's Samford University in 1979. He rose to prominence in 1997, when Bill Clinton named him US Attorney for the Northern District of Alabama.  Then in his forties, Mr Jones secured a string of high-profile prosecutions, including those of two Ku Klux Klan members who bombed a Baptist church in Birmingham in 1963, killing four black schoolgirls.  He was also linked to the indictment of Eric Rudolph, who killed an off-duty police officer in a 1998 attack on a Birmingham abortion clinic.  This record has helped Mr Jones present as a candidate for our violent times, where white nationalists are raising their banners unafraid on the streets of America.  ""Sadly, the pattern of violence as a response to hope has reasserted itself,"" he wrote in the Huffington Post. ""We saw it in the Charleston church massacre in 2015. We saw it on display in Charlottesville this past August. We've seen it in the attacks on mosques and synagogues, and against the LGBT community. We see it in the hostility toward the Latino community.  ""We cannot sweep this violence under the rug. We must address the forces that lead to it and prosecute those who perpetrate such acts."" Though Roy Moore's evangelical fervour grabbed more attention, Mr Jones is also a Christian - specifically, a Methodist. He has worshipped at the same church for more than 30 years, and has said the message of Christianity should be one of fairness and inclusivity, not extremism. Politics took an early hold on Jones, who began his career as a staff counsel to the US Senate Judiciary Committee, working for Alabama Senator Howell Heflin.  From 1980 he spent four years as an Assistant US Attorney, then from 1984-97 worked for a criminal defence firm in Birmingham, Alabama. In 2013, he co-founded his own firm - Jones & Hawley. Mr Jones counts former Vice President Joe Biden as an old friend, having led his 1988 presidential campaign in Alabama. Mr Biden said of him at an October 2017 rally: ""I can count on two hands the people I've campaigned for that have as much integrity, as much courage."" He added that Mr Jones ""helped remove 40 years of stain and pain from this state"" with the church bombing convictions. From the off, Mr Jones was aware he was facing poor odds in Alabama, which backed Donald Trump in 2016 with a 28-point landslide.  ""They have told me time and again that this race is a long shot,"" Mr Jones said of the problem. ""Well, folks... When you are on the right side of history and the right side of justice, you can do anything."" The delicacy of the task was complicated by allegations against Mr Jones's anti-establishment opponent, Roy Moore. The gun-toting Republican faces several claims of historic sexual misconduct with underage girls, which he denies. Mr Jones's campaign adverts have worked to paint him as the ethical choice for Alabama, even as prominent national Republicans broke ranks to refuse Mr Moore their votes. Some ads featured self-declared Republican voters voicing their support for Mr Jones with the words: ""Don't vote for the party. Vote for the man."" The New York Times reported in mid-November that Democrat cash had funded nearly $2m (£1.5m) in TV adverts for Mr Jones, while Mr Moore had spent only about $300,000. Policy-wise, Mr Jones has pitched himself as a moderate Democrat, calling for an increase in the minimum wage, but also lower corporate taxes ""to try to get reinvestment back into this country"".  He supports renewable energy, but is hawkish on the need for increased defence spending, saying it will protect the US and shore up Alabama's economy. On healthcare, a key divide between Republicans and Democrats, he opposes the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, but wants changes to the existing ""broken"" system. While President Trump has stoutly supported Roy Moore, national stars of the Democratic Party waited until the last minute to descend on Alabama, to avoid spooking voters with their liberal associations.  On the eve of the election, reports said former President Barack Obama had recorded a robo-call - an automated telephone call to Alabama households - urging the public to back his man.  ""This one's serious,"" Mr Obama said in the message, according to CNN. ""You can't sit it out."" Other senior Democrats who have spoken for Mr Jones include Ohio congressman Tim Ryan, and John Lewis, a revered civil rights leader who was one of the original Freedom Riders and led a famous protest march from Selma in Alabama.  New Jersey Senator Cory Booker, a rising Democrat star considered a possible 2020 presidential candidate, made the trip to Alabama in person, declaring: ""I'm here to try and help some folk get woke. Democracy is not a spectator sport."" Mr Jones has proved he is capable of causing a stunning upset in the ruby red Yellowhammer state. Now he'll be returning to work for the federal government for the first time since making his name with the church bombing prosecutions."

Hawkish,'Bank of England executive must quit over breach',2024-09-25,2019-12-19,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50849479,"A former member of the Bank of England has called for the resignation of its chief operating officer after it emerged an audio feed of sensitive information had been leaked to traders. The Bank admitted one of its suppliers had ""misused"" the feed to give hedge funds early access to information. Danny Blanchflower, who previously served on the rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee, said Joanna Place should step down following the breach. The Bank of England refused to comment. Many Bank press conferences are broadcast via video, but there is also a back-up audio feed in case of problems. The audio is available between five and eight seconds before the video. It meant that high-speed financial traders had access to the words of Governor Mark Carney and his officials before their remarks were more widely broadcast. Ms Place reports directly to Mr Carney and has had responsibility for information security since July 2017. Mr Blanchflower said: ""The question I ask is did the chief operating officer at the Bank of England know that access was being sold? If so, she should resign. And if she didn't know she should resign as well. ""I just don't know how her position is maintained because this could have created a lot of harm. People could have made a lot of money.""  The Bank of England said it had disabled the audio supplier's access. The hijacking of the audio feed, first reported in the Times, gave an advantage to high-speed traders, such as currency speculators, who can make millions of pounds on tiny market moves.  Comments from Bank officials about market sensitive matters such as interest rate decisions can affect the value of sterling and other market assets within fractions of a second. The Times said it understood that the eavesdropping on the press conferences had been happening at least since the beginning of this year.  Mr Blanchflower said the ""astonishing"" revelation was ""a stain"" on Mr Carney as he prepares to step down as Governor on 31 January.  Commenting on who could be in line to replace Mr Carney, Mr Blanchflower said his ""old graduate school room mate"" Gerard Lyons, who was Prime Minister Boris Johnson's former chief economist when he was Mayor of London, may ""rise to the top of pack"".  The Bank of England said the leak ""was wholly unacceptable use of the audio feed"" and the way hedge funds were allowed to make use of it was ""without the Bank's knowledge or consent, and is being investigated further"".  The matter has been referred to the market regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, which told the BBC it was ""looking at the issue"". Being able to hear the press conference early would provide an unfair advantage. Interest rates, economic guidance, and the financial health of banks and the markets are frequently discussed at the press conferences. The Bank sets rates eight times a year and holds a press conference on four of those occasions. A report on financial stability comes out twice, which also includes a press conference.  All of this is broadcast on video provided by Bloomberg, which is shared to other news outlets.  The company that provides the audio feed, which is separate from the video feed, has not been identified.  A spokesperson from Bloomberg confirmed to the BBC that the company does not provide the audio. ""Bloomberg provides a distinct and independent video feed for the BoE's press conferences. This is completely separate to the backup audio feed.""  The pronouncements of central bank chiefs can sound like boring technical gobbledy-gook. But every word, every nuance, is carefully studied by financial markets for the slightest hint about the Bank's intentions and can cause big movements in the value of the pound and government bonds. So getting wind of any potential future changes, even a few seconds ahead of the rest of the market, could be extremely valuable. Computerised trading programs can execute thousands of transactions a second, so the four-to-eight second advantage enjoyed by those traders accessing the back-up audio feed is a vast amount of time in terms of market movements.  The Bank of England is usually very careful in managing the dissemination of sensitive information and the Bank was keen to stress that the information breach did not apply to the release of decisions on interest rates - just the press conferences afterwards. But those press conferences can - and do - move markets so this is still an embarrassing admission.  The Times said it had seen documents revealing how the service was sold on to traders. The supply cost between £2,500 and £5,000 each press conference for each client in addition to a subscription fee.  It is unclear whether the leaked audio feed was used by traditional traders at their desks to steal a march on rivals, or whether algorithm-driven software, that can conduct thousands of transactions a second, could be used to exploit those few seconds advantage. Hypothetically a computer program could be designed to pick out key words from the Bank Governor's comments and trade on them. But central bankers are notoriously euphemistic. ""[Early access] would be more important to a traditional voice trader or hedge fund,"" says Malcolm Baker, co-Founder at FX FWD, a trading firm.  ""Central bankers can speak in language that is hard to understand and there is a lot that's implied. It's like old Elizabethan language and can be misleading. A trader like me just wants to understand - is it hawkish? Or dovish?"" The Bank has not named the audio supplier, but market intelligence firm Statisma has posted a denial that it offers its customers information not available to the public. Statisma, operating under the same management as a production firm called Encoded Media, advertises on Twitter a service where traders can hear central bank announcements first.  Press conferences from the European Central Bank, the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of Canada were also on offer to trading firms. Traders signed up to Statisma's service receive an email detailing the speeches with dial in numbers.  In a response to several calls made from the BBC and other media outlets, it posted on its website this statement: ""We DO NOT carry embargoed information and we DO NOT release information without it first being made available to the public"". An ECB spokesman said the central bank moved to address possible issues with audio broadcasts in September, effectively delaying the feed. ""Since September this year the ECB offers a low latency audio feed for each monetary policy press conference to address exactly the issues that were in the news today.  ""Therefore, it doesn't make any sense for anyone to use commercially offered solutions because the solution we offer is the fastest option available and it is free for everyone,"" the spokesman said."

Hawkish,Patient took own life in Covid 'blind spot',2024-09-25,2020-10-29,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-54733664,"A patient at a mental health hospital took their own life after a Covid-19 isolation area created ""blind spots"" on a ward, a report has found. A Care Quality Commission (CQC) inspection of Langdon Hospital in Dawlish, Devon, found safety and staffing concerns. It said the Devon Partnership NHS Trust must make ""urgent improvements"". The poor lines of sight caused by the coronavirus safety changes were not identified by the trust. This led to a patient on the Ashcombe Ward of the Dewnans Centre at the hospital taking their own life on 31 July, the CQC said. It happened in an area of the ward where staff ""could not easily observe patients"", the inspection concluded. The report did not give any details about the patient who died. An urgent inspection of the trust was undertaken in August after the death and other safety issues had been reported to the CQC. The healthcare regulator found a ""number of concerns"" relating to patient safety and staffing levels. There was also an issue with the number of vacancies on Holcombe Ward, with staff left ""stressed and exhausted following the demands of the Covid-19 pandemic"". This combined with the ward being ""heavily reliant on bank and agency workers"" left gaps in staffing which ""could potentially affect the safe care and treatment of patients"", the inspection found. Karen Bennett-Wilson from the CQC said the trust had been informed of the need to take ""immediate action"" following the ""tragic death"". She said: ""We are continuing to monitor the trust closely and will not hesitate to take action if it fails to make the necessary improvements."" A spokesman for the trust welcomed the report and acknowledged the ""important concerns"" raised. He said: ""We have already started to address many of these concerns and we will be working closely with the CQC to monitor progress."""
Hawkish,'It's the loudest instrument in town',2024-09-25,2023-01-02,By Brodie Owen,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-63873253,"""The church bells are the sound of England - no other country does this to the same scale."" That is how bell-ringer John Eardley sums up the world of campanology - the subject of bells - as part of a push to get younger people involved. Mr Eardley, the 80-year-old tower captain of the Church of St Peter and St Paul in Ermington, Devon, was a boy when he started. But young people getting involved in bell-ringing is a rarity now - and some fear more churches could fall silent. Across the UK, there are about 38,000 bells, but only 30,000 bell-ringers, the Central Council of Church Bell Ringers said. The organisation is aiming to fill the shortage and recruit more bell-ringers ahead of next year's coronation of King Charles III. Playing an important role in the national celebration, the council is encouraging as many churches to ring their bells as possible on the day of the coronation.  With volunteers already having to backfill at other towers, organisers fear some churches may not be able to participate. In Ermington, the bells have been manually rung for more than 500 years. Meeting every week, Mr Eardley's group ensures the tradition is kept alive in the South Hams village. He is hoping next year's coronation of King Charles III will spur the next generation of bell-ringers. ""I've rung at 312 different churches - that's how much I enjoy it,"" Mr Eardley said. ""Every church is different and that's part of the challenge."" He said the art would appeal to anyone who was interested in music and rhythm. ""If you can dance well, you can probably ring well,"" he said. Lynne Hughes, from the Guild of Devonshire Ringers, said people in the county were often 50 or 60 when they decided to get into bell-ringing. ""That's all very well for now, but that's not planning for the future, is it?"" she said.  ""We need people of all ages coming through - some places don't have any younger people at all."" Ms Hughes, who is also the tower captain at St Gregory's Church in Dawlish, was 17 when she started bell-ringing. ""It's a bit like learning a musical instrument or playing sport - if you start when you're younger you might go on to be an expert,"" she said. ""It would be such a shame if churches didn't have ringers and the bells were never rung - unfortunately there are churches in that position, even now."" Elena Brake, 29, began ringing at the Minster Church of St Andrew in Plymouth five years ago.  ""It was curiosity that got me involved,"" she said. ""I wanted to meet new people and try something a bit different - it just so happened that the bells were ringing at the time I wanted to do something. ""I turned up and they were really welcoming and straight away from that first practice I was part of the family."" Ms Brake is a founding member of the Young Change Ringers Association set up to encourage and inspire young bell-ringers. She said bell-ringing gave young people a chance to learn new skills. ""You become part of this tradition that operates across the whole of the UK and the world,"" she said. ""It's a public performance - there's always a challenge and you have to work together as a team to get it to sound good. It's a whole new set of skills - like teamwork or communication skills - things like that are really valuable and can stay with you."" She said bell-ringing was ""part of the soundscape of Britain"" and more young people needed to become involved. ""It's the loudest instrument in town,"" she said. ""Bells are associated with happy occasions, but also remembrance - we remind people to stop and think. ""When the Queen died and ringing happened across the UK, we celebrated her life and mourned her loss. It was only a very small part of [the period of mourning] but you could feel how important it was."" Follow BBC News South West on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

Hawkish,Japanese yen slips to 24-year low against dollar,2024-09-25,2022-09-02,By Annabelle  Liang,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-62762138,"The Japanese yen has declined to its lowest level against the US dollar since August 1998, prompting the government to weigh action. The boost in the dollar stems from data suggesting the labour market of the world's biggest economy is recovering. On Thursday, the currency pair breached the key psychological level of 140 yen against the US dollar. While many central banks in Asia have hiked the cost of borrowing to mirror the US, Japan has not followed suit. The Bank of Japan has maintained its ultra-low interest rates to support economic recovery, and this is one of the reasons the yen has fallen in value against the US dollar and other major currencies. Higher interest rates tend to attract foreign investment. That increases demand for and the value of currencies from countries with higher interest rates. A US Labor Department report on Thursday showed that the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell to a two-month low, suggesting the jobs market is recovering post-pandemic.  This sparked buying interest in the US dollar which drove it to a fresh high against the Japanese currency, at 140.23 yen. But it was not the only currency affected by dollar strength.  The British pound slid by around 5% for the first time since October 2016. The US dollar gained momentum earlier in the week, after Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell said the US central bank would continue to raise interest rates in the coming months. Mr Powell added that the Fed could keep rates high ""for some time"" at an annual conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. ""It's a strong USD story this week after the hawkish Jackson Hole forum"", Philip Wee, senior currency economist at DBS Bank, told the BBC. ""From here, more Asian central banks are ready to hike, some larger than usual. This should help offset some of the pressures from the strong USD,"" he added. On Friday, Japanese Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki said the government would take ""appropriate"" action to address the yen's decline. ""Excessive, disorderly currency moves could have a negative impact on the economy and financial conditions,"" Mr Suzuki told a press conference. However, Dwyfor Evans of State Street Global Markets told the BBC that measures to lift the yen ""could prove futile"" because of the gap between interest rates in Japan and much of the rest of the world. The Bank of Japan last intervened in currency markets in 2011, after an earthquake and tsunami triggered the Fukushima nuclear crisis.  At midday Friday in Asia, the yen has continued to slip, trading around 140.35 against the dollar."

Hawkish,Pound heads for two-year low as holidays begin,2024-09-25,2019-07-09,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48926232,"The pound is heading for two-year lows against the dollar as markets react to continuing Brexit uncertainty and signs that the UK economy is slowing. The currency fell sharply after data showed slowing sales at UK retailers and economists forecast a contraction in the economy in the second quarter. Against the dollar, the pound fell below $1.25 and was close to its lowest level since April 2017. The pound was also at a six-month low against the euro at just above €1.11. With the holiday season getting underway, it means travellers from the UK will getting fewer dollars and euros for their pounds. Sterling has been swayed by uncertainty in the aftermath of the EU referendum, but has been more stable in recent months because of confidence about the UK economy. However, recent economic surveys have suggested that the economy may now be weakening and Jane Foley, head of foreign exchange strategy at Rabobank, said this was being factored into the market. ""The economic picture is not particularly pretty,"" she said. The pound fell 0.5% against the dollar at $1.2455, marking the lowest point for it since April 2017, excluding a brief ""flash fall"" in January this year. Back in May, the pound had been trading at around $1.27. Last week, a survey suggested the UK's manufacturing sector contracted at the fastest pace for more than six years. On Tuesday, figures from the British Retail Consortium showed average sales growth slowed to 0.6% in the 12 months to June, the weakest reading since its records began in 1995. Ms Foley also cited a survey by Bloomberg which showed that economists are expecting the economy to contract in the second quarter - for the first time since 2012. An update on the UK economy is due on Wednesday when growth data for the three-month period to May will be released, and economists polled by Reuters expect growth of 0.1%. That would be slower than the 0.5% rate seen in the first quarter of the year. The market is also focusing on the Conservative leadership contest.  Under Theresa May's premiership, the market had thought the chances of a no-deal were slim, but Ms Foley said that was not the expectation if Boris Johnson wins the leadership battle. ""That's what the market is worried about,"" she said. Neil Mellor, currency strategist at Bank of New York Mellon, said that another factor at play was a strengthening in the dollar ahead of testimony by the head of the US central bank. This was helping to push the pound lower. Jerome Powell, chair of the Federal Reserve, testifies to the US Congress on Wednesday. Mr Mellor said he could provide a more hawkish tone - meaning interest rate cuts were less likely - than previously expected."

The schools, including Tiverton High School and Swimbridge Primary School in Devon, are on the School Rebuilding Programme. Tiverton High School, which was built in 1959, has suffered a number of structural problems. Swimbridge Primary will be moving to a new site after concerns about ground above the school moving down the hill. Tipton St John Primary School, which has seen numerous incidents of flooding over the years, will get a new building under the School Rebuilding Programme, which the government says has invested more than £13bn to maintain and improve schools since 2015. Built in 1843, Tipton St John Primary consists of two separate buildings, a lower site for younger pupils, and an upper facility for older students. Around 95 pupils currently attend the school. However, the school has been hit by flooding in the past, with pupils even being evacuated due to the severity. Such is the school's susceptibility to future flooding, the Environment Agency and the Department for Education have warned that lives could be at risk. The Devon and Cornwall schools listed for improvements are: Devon Jon Sowden, Tiverton High School's estate manager, told BBC Radio Devon in August that there were ""large amounts of concrete crumbling"" at the school, along with asbestos. All external doors needed to be replaced, plaster was falling off and a roof was ""crumbling away"", he added. Richard Foord, Liberal Democrat MP for Tiverton and Honiton, said: ""This is a moment the community has long been waiting for. ""I won't rest until there are shovels in the ground."" Selaine Saxby, Conservative MP for North Devon, said it had been a difficult time for staff and students at Swimbridge Primary and she was very pleased that the school would ""have the new school it so clearly needs and deserves"". Colin Butler, executive headteacher of Tipton St John Primary School, said it was ""such a relief to know that staff and pupils will never need to worry for the safety of all every time there is heavy rain"" and he was delighted that the school had been listed for improvements.

Hawkish,Why Biden won't send troops to Ukraine,2024-09-25,2022-02-25,By Barbara Plett Usher,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-60499385,"President Joe Biden has spent enormous diplomatic capital on countering Russian aggression toward Ukraine.  His administration relentlessly broadcast doomsday warnings about an impending invasion - which proved to be correct - and declared that no less than the international order was at stake.   But Mr Biden has also made clear that the Americans are not willing to fight, even though the Russians clearly are. Furthermore, he's ruled out sending forces into Ukraine to rescue US citizens, should it come to that. And he's actually pulled out troops who were serving in the country as military advisers and monitors.   Why has he drawn this red line in the most consequential foreign policy crisis of his presidency?   First of all, Ukraine isn't in America's neighbourhood. It is not located on the US border. Nor does it host a US military base. It does not have strategic oil reserves, and it's not a major trade partner.   But that lack of national interest hasn't stopped former presidents from expending blood and treasure on behalf of others in the past. In 1995 Bill Clinton intervened militarily in the war that followed the collapse of Yugoslavia. And in 2011 Barack Obama did the same in the Libyan civil war, both largely on humanitarian and human rights grounds.  In 1990 George H W Bush justified his international coalition to expel Iraq from Kuwait as defending the rule of law against the rule of the jungle. Biden's top national security officials have used similar language when describing Russia's threat to international principles of peace and security. But they have been preaching a response of economic warfare through crippling sanctions as a response, not military operations.   This has something to do with President Biden's non-interventionist instincts.  Granted, they were developed over time. He supported US military action in the 1990s to deal with ethnic conflicts in the Balkans. And he voted for America's ill-fated invasion of Iraq in 2003. But since then he's become more wary of using US military power.  He opposed Obama's intervention in Libya as well as his surge of troops in Afghanistan. He resolutely defends his order to withdraw US forces from Afghanistan last year despite the chaos that accompanied it and the humanitarian catastrophe left in its wake.  And his top diplomat Antony Blinken - a Biden ""Whisperer"" who's crafted the president's foreign policy over some 20 years of working at his side - has defined national security to be more about combating climate change, fighting global diseases and competing with China than about military interventionism.  A recent AP-NORC poll found 72% said the US should play a minor role in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, or none at all.  They are focused on pocketbook issues, particularly rising inflation, something Biden has to be mindful of as mid-term elections loom.  In Washington the crisis is consuming lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, who are demanding the toughest of sanctions. But even reliably hawkish voices like Republican Senator Ted Cruz don't want Biden to send American troops into Ukraine and ""start a shooting war with Putin.""  Another foreign policy hawk, Republican Senator Marco Rubio, has said war between the world's two largest nuclear powers would not be good for anybody.   That's the bottom line - Putin's stockpile of nuclear warheads.  Biden doesn't want to spark a ""world war"" by risking a direct clash between American and Russian troops in Ukraine and he's been open about that.  ""It's not like we're dealing with a terrorist organisation,"" the president told NBC earlier this month. ""We're dealing with one of the largest armies in the world. This is a very difficult situation, and things could go crazy quickly.""  Nor are there treaty obligations compelling the US to take this risk. An attack against any Nato country is an attack against all - the foundational Article 5 commitment that binds all members to defend one another.  But Ukraine is not a member of Nato, a factor that's been cited by Blinken to explain why the Americans will not fight for the values they so strenuously extol. There is a certain irony here, given that the conflict is about Putin's demands for guarantees that Ukraine never be allowed to join the military alliance, and Nato's refusal to give them.  The Harvard professor and foreign policy realist Stephen Walt has argued the rejection of compromise by the US and other Nato countries does not make practical sense given their unwillingness to put any military muscle behind it.   President Biden has in fact been sending troops to Europe and redeploying those already there, to bolster Nato allies that border Ukraine and Russia.  This has been billed by the administration as an effort to reassure former Soviet republics nervous about Putin's wider goal of pressuring Nato to roll back forces from its eastern flank.  But the invasion of Ukraine this week has stoked concerns about the prospect of wider conflict - either an accidental spillover or a deliberate attack by Russia.  The latter would be a major escalation, invoking the Article 5 mutual Nato defence commitment. But either could draw US forces into a battle.  ""If he did move into Nato countries,"" Mr Biden has said, ""we will be involved.""  "
Hawkish,Tom Tugendhat: From wars to front line at Westminster,2024-09-25,2022-07-15,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-62177286,"Like some of the other contenders, Tom Tugendhat was not a name widely known to the British public when the Conservative leadership race began.  MP for Tonbridge and Malling in Kent since 2015, he was the only person to make it through to the final five contenders not to hold ministerial office. But the former army officer was knocked out in the third round of voting, having received 31 votes. Mr Tugendhat has cultivated a reputation at Westminster for holding the government to account for its conduct of foreign affairs from Afghanistan to Ukraine in his role as chairman of the foreign affairs select committee.  His criticisms have often been regarded as carrying extra weight because of his role as an officer in the Territorial Army, seving in both the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts, where he was involved in several front line operations.  Before entering politics, he also worked as a journalist and as a public relations consultant in Lebanon. Back in the UK he was a management consultant and an adviser to the Chief of the Defence Staff.     Mr Tugendhat, who is 49, was born in Westminster, the son of a High Court judge and his French wife. He is a nephew of Conservative peer Christopher Tugendhat, a former vice-president of the European Commission.  He holds dual British and French citizenship. His wife is a French judge and senior civil servant. He was educated at a private school and studied theology at Bristol University, before completing a Master's degree in Islamic studies at Cambridge and learning Arabic in Yemen. In Parliament, he's a member of the One Nation group of Conservative MPs, who see themselves as socially liberal centrists.   In the Brexit referendum, Mr Tugendhat voted to remain in the European Union. He later backed the withdrawal agreement negotiated by Theresa May on each of the three occasions it was put to a vote. He was highly critical of the Nato withdrawal from Afghanistan in August 2021. As Kabul fell to the Taliban and Western countries scrambled to evacuate their nationals and Afghans who had helped them, Mr Tugendhat described what was happening as Britain's ""biggest foreign policy disaster since Suez"". He has been hawkish on a number of foreign policy issues - accusing Iran of arming terrorists around the world and advocating stronger action against Russia even before its invasion of Ukraine.  He has been particularly critical of China. In 2020, he co-founded the China Research Group of mainly Conservative MPs to gain a ""better understanding of China's economic ambitions and global role"".  Pressure from the group helped persuade the government to change its mind about allowing the Chinese telecoms firm Huawei to have a role in the UK's 5G wireless networks.  In March 2021, Mr Tugendhat was one of five MPs to be sanctioned by China for spreading what it called ""lies and disinformation"". He was later banned from entering China.  He has often had a strained relationship with Boris Johnson and backed Michael Gove in the 2019 Tory leadership contest.   During the current leadership campaign, Mr Tugendhat has promised to cut national insurance, to reduce fuel duty by 10p a litre and to increase tax incentives for business investment,  He has pledged to increase spending on defence to 3% of national income, saying national security must come before ""bean counters and spreadsheets"". In common with the other candidates, he has said he would retain the government's policy of sending some asylum seekers to Rwanda, despite fierce opposition from campaigners.   ""The Rwanda solution is not one anyone would have initially chosen, but the reality is you cannot have rewards for criminality and illegal action,"" he said.  In the first ballot of Tory MPs, M Tugendhat secured 37 votes. That fell to 32 votes in Thursday's second round. "
Hawkish,Battered rail line to get higher wall,2024-09-25,2019-02-04,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-47121121,"A coastal railway line that washed into the sea five years ago may soon be protected from the wind and waves by a new wall. The sea defences in Dawlish, Devon, collapsed during storms on 4 February 2014, leaving the tracks dangling above the waves. Network Rail has applied for permission to raise the wall from its current height of 5m to 7.5m. The plans will need to be approved by Teignbridge council and the government. Network Rail said the wall would give ""far more protection from waves and extreme weather"" and claimed it is ""future-proofed"" against rising sea levels. Latest news from Devon and Cornwall The Dawlish line is an important part of the infrastructure connecting Devon and Cornwall to the rest of the country. Tudor Evans, Labour leader of the Plymouth City Council, said while the announcement of the plans being submitted was ""welcome"", his council also wants a ""firm funding commitment"" for other rail improvement projects in the area. Engineering contractor Arup was involved in drawing up the plans for the new wall, but the potential cost has not yet been revealed by Network Rail."
Hawkish,Israeli Arab MP returns to coalition after crisis,2024-09-25,2022-05-23,By Raffi Berg,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-61530015,"An Israeli Arab MP who quit its ruling coalition, plunging the government into a political crisis, has reversed her decision and rejoined. Ghaida Rinawie Zoabi resigned on Thursday, leaving the government as a minority for the first time. However she reversed course on Sunday, in a move which restores the government to a knife-edge number of seats. It was the most serious crisis to rock the coalition, which has been in power for just under a year. Led by nationalist Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, the coalition - the most diverse in the country's history - brought together eight parties from across the political spectrum, some with major ideological differences. Significantly, the government includes an independent Arab party for the first time since the state was founded in 1948. Israel's Arab minority comprises about 20% of the population and although they have equal rights under the law, they often complain of discrimination. Ms Zoabi, of the left-wing Meretz party, had resigned, accusing the heads of the coalition of ""hawkish, rigid and right-wing stances regarding basic issues of utmost importance for Arab society"". She said she had been swayed by recent events, including the funeral in Jerusalem of Al Jazeera reporter Sherine Abu Aqla, shot dead in the occupied West Bank last week while reporting on an Israeli operation, which saw troops in gun battles with Palestinian militants. At Abu Aqla's funeral, Israeli police beat and kicked mourners carrying her coffin aloft, causing it to almost fall to the ground. Police said they had acted after being ""exposed to violence by rioters"". The scenes, carried live on Al Jazeera, caused widespread outrage and scathing criticism of the police's actions. However, following a meeting with Israel's alternate prime minister Yair Lapid and eight Arab mayors on Sunday, the MP announced she was returning to the government. Ms Zoabia said doing so would help improve the needs of Israel's Arab community, and that local leaders had placed her ""under immense pressure"" to rejoin. Her return restores the government to 60 seats in the 120-seat parliament. Ms Zoabi was the second member to resign within weeks, after a member of the prime minister's own right-wing Yamina party quit, saying the coalition was ""harming... the Jewish identity"" of the state. The coalition was formed in order to bring together enough parties to oust long-term Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu following a series on inconclusive elections. Mr Netanyahu has been leader of the opposition since then and has vowed to return to office."
Hawkish,US-China contagion: The battle behind the scenes,2024-09-25,2020-03-24,By Jonathan Marcus,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-52008453,"It is clearly not a good time for the world and it is not a good time for relations between the US and China. President Donald Trump has repeatedly chosen to call the coronavirus the ""Chinese virus"". His hawkish Secretary of State Mike Pompeo calls it the ""Wuhan virus"", something that causes huge offence in Beijing.  The president and secretary of state have both denounced China for its failings in the initial handling of the outbreak. But Chinese spokesmen have utterly rejected any idea that they were less than transparent about what was going on. Meanwhile, social media in China has spread stories that the pandemic has been caused by a US military germ warfare programme; rumours that gained considerable traction. Scientists have demonstrated that the virus structure is entirely natural in origin.   But this is not just a war of words, something more fundamental is going on. Earlier this month, when the US announced that it was closing its borders to travellers from many EU countries, including Italy, the Chinese government announced that it was sending medical teams and supplies to Italy, the country at the leading edge of the coronavirus pandemic. It has sent help to Iran and Serbia too.  It was a moment of huge symbolism. And it was an indication of the information battle that is being waged behind the scenes, with China eager to emerge from this crisis with renewed status as a global player. Indeed, it is a battle which the US - at the moment - is losing hands down. And the belated despatch of a small mobile US Air Force medical facility to Italy is hardly going to alter the equation. This is a moment when the administrative and political systems of all countries are being stress-tested like never before. Leadership will be at a premium. Existing political leaders will ultimately be judged by how they seized the moment; the clarity of their discourse; and the efficiency with which they marshalled their countries' resources to respond to the pandemic. The pandemic has hit at a time when US-China relations were already at a low ebb. A partial trade deal has barely plastered over the commercial tensions between the two countries.  Both China and the US are re-arming, openly preparing for a potential future conflict in the Asia-Pacific. China has already emerged, at least in regional terms, as a military super-power in its own right. And China now is eager for the wider status that it believes its international position requires.  The pandemic then threatens to pitch US-China relations into an even more difficult period. This could have an important bearing upon both the course of this crisis and the world that emerges from it. When the virus is defeated, China's economic resurgence is going to play a critical role in helping to rebuild the shattered global economy. But for now, Chinese assistance is essential in combating the coronavirus. Medical data and experiences need to continue to be shared. China is also a huge manufacturer of medical equipment and disposable items like masks and protective suits, essential to handling infected patients and items that are required in astronomical numbers. China is in many ways the medical manufacturing workshop of the world, capable of expanding production in ways few other countries can. China is seizing an opportunity but, according to many of President Trump's critics, it is he who has dropped the ball.  The Trump administration initially failed to accept the seriousness of this crisis, seeing it as another opportunity to assert ""America First"" and the supposed superiority of its system. But what is at stake now is global leadership.  As two Asia experts, Kurt M Campbell - who served as assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs in the Obama administration - and Rush Doshi, note in a recent article for Foreign Affairs: ""The status of the United States as a global leader over the past seven decades has been built not just on wealth and power but also, and just as important, on the legitimacy that  flows from the United States' domestic governance, provision of global public goods, and ability and willingness to muster and coordinate a global response to crises."" The coronavirus pandemic, they say, ""is testing all three elements of US leadership. So far, Washington is failing the test. As Washington falters, Beijing is moving quickly and adeptly to take advantage of the opening created by US mistakes, filling the vacuum to present itself as the global leader in pandemic response.""  It is easy to be cynical. Many might wonder how China could seek advantage at this time - Campbell and Doshi call it ""Chutzpah"" - given that it is in China that this pandemic appears to have originated. Beijing's initial response to the developing crisis in Wuhan was secretive. However, since then, it has marshalled its vast resources effectively and impressively. As Suzanne Nossel, the CEO of the press freedom organisation PEN America, writes in an article on the Foreign Policy website: ""Fearful that the initial denial and mismanagement of the outbreak could trigger social unrest, Beijing has now mounted an aggressive domestic and global propaganda campaign to tout its draconian approach to the epidemic, downplay its role in sparking the global outbreak, and contrast its efforts favourably against those of Western governments and particularly the United States."" Many western commentators see China becoming more authoritarian and more nationalist and fear that these trends will be accelerated by the impact of the pandemic and the resulting economic slowdown. But the impact upon Washington's global standing could be even greater. America's allies are taking note. They may not criticise the Trump administration openly, but many have clear differences with it over attitudes to China; the security of Chinese technology (the Huawei controversy); and over Iran and other regional issues. China is using its outreach on the pandemic to try to establish the parameters for a different relationship in the future - one perhaps where China fast becomes the ""essential power"". Link-ups in the counter-coronavirus campaign with its near neighbours - Japan and South Korea - and the provision of vital health equipment to the EU, can be seen in this light.  Campbell and Doshi, in their Foreign Affairs piece, make an explicit comparison with Britain's decline. They say that the botched British operation in 1956 to seize the Suez Canal ""laid bare the decay in British power and marked the end of the United Kingdom's reign as a global power"".  ""Today,"" they say, ""US policymakers should recognize that if the United States does not rise to meet the moment, the coronavirus pandemic could mark another 'Suez moment'."" "
Hawkish,Five Stephen Hawking achievements,2024-09-25,2017-07-02,Unknown,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-40475811,No content available
Hawkish,Returning to the place where we saw our parents shot,2024-09-25,2017-11-16,By Andrew Whitehead,https://www.bbc.com/news/stories-41996612,"Seventy years ago, a young British couple was shot dead at a mission hospital in Kashmir, making orphans of their three sons - one only two weeks old. To mark the anniversary two of those sons, now white-haired, made a personal pilgrimage to the spot. ""I feel very emotional to be here,"" says Doug Dykes, standing yards from the veranda where his mother and father suffered fatal bullet wounds when he was two years old. ""I saw my parents being killed - that's what I've been told. My father tried to stop the attackers approaching the nuns and he was shot. I ran screaming towards my father. My mother ran after me - and then she was also shot."" There's a touch of anguish in his recollections - a sense that he may in some way have been responsible for the death of his mother.  We are standing by his parents' graves in this remote corner of the Kashmir valley, the headstones shaded by recently harvested apple and walnut trees.  It may seem like a tranquil spot, but Tom and Biddy Dykes, an army officer and his wife, were killed in the opening salvos of the Kashmir crisis - and 70 years later the conflict continues to claim lives just about every day. In all, six people lost their lives at St Joseph's Catholic mission in the riverside town of Baramulla on that October morning in 1947. Jose Barretto, the husband of the hospital doctor, tried to save the nuns who ran the mission and was put up against a tree and shot. A nurse, Philomena, died seeking to protect the patients. Motia Devi Kapoor, a patient, was stabbed to death in her hospital bed. The Franciscan Missionaries of Mary also lost one of their own - Sister Teresalina, a newly-arrived Spanish nun in her 20s. She leapt in front of the convent's Belgian mother superior, taking a bullet intended for the older woman. She is buried in the nuns' graveyard on the other side of the mission grounds.  All were murdered by armed tribesmen from Pakistan who invaded Kashmir to try to prevent the princely state becoming part of India after the British withdrawal - and to take away as much loot as they could carry. As they ransacked St Joseph's on 27 October 1947 the first Indian troops were landing in Kashmir to repulse the invaders - and they have been here ever since to prevent the region being seized by Pakistan, which claims it as its own. Security concerns were the main reason why the oldest of the three Dykes children, named Tom like his father, never managed to revisit Baramulla before his death in 2003. When I met him a few years earlier his recollections of the attack were extraordinarily vivid. ""I can remember waking up, and there was gunfire all around the place,"" he told me.  ""Then these fellows that had raided the hospital started to batter down the door of the room we were in. The splinters started to fly across the room, and I could see the wild faces through the cracks in the door. ""The tribesmen were looting the place, they were pulling everything apart, and putting their booty into sheets which lay on the floor and were made up into bundles.""  A family servant managed to take the five-year-old away from the marauders. A little later they returned to see if they could find Tom's family. ""We went back to the central part of the hospital, a garden area with a path around it. And we came across these bodies, covered with blood. And sitting on top, howling his eyes out, was my little brother Douglas."" I stumbled on this story when, 20 years ago, I met the last remaining nun who had survived the ordeal. Sister Emilia, an Italian, recounted how the tribesmen had climbed over the mission walls, smashed through locked doors and manhandled some of the nuns. After they killed her friend - the new Spanish sister, Teresalina - Emilia thought she too was about to die. The hospital run by the 16 nuns had a high reputation. Biddy Dykes - a motherly woman with a ""round, happy face darkish hair and a lovely smile"", in the description of another army wife - went there to give birth to at least two of her sons.  Their father was a Sandhurst-trained soldier from a family with a tradition of service in the British Indian army. He married Biddy, a military nurse, at Agra, the city of the Taj Mahal, in 1940, and had risen to the rank of lieutenant-colonel by the end of World War Two. When the British pulled out of India in August 1947, he agreed to stay on for a few months as an officer in the Indian army's Sikh Regiment to help the transition. The family has an anguished letter Biddy Dykes wrote 10 days before she died, shortly after giving birth to her third son, James. The security situation was alarming and she was desperately waiting for her husband to turn up and get them out. ""Hells Bells, I'd give anything to see Tom walk in this evening,"" she wrote. ""He said in one letter that he'd be up here today. But I don't think there is an earthly chance."" In fact, Dykes did make it to Baramulla but was unable to get his family to safety.  A letter has emerged that he wrote after his arrival to a British officer in the Kashmiri capital, Srinagar, just 30 miles away. In it he explains that he has come to collect his family only to be ""overtaken by the present events"", in his astonishingly understated words. In clipped military fashion, he writes: ""I should be most grateful if you would send a vehicle here to Baramulla to collect us."" With an invasion underway, the evacuation was impractical. Two days later, he and his wife were dead. The three orphaned Dykes boys along with about 70 others were held captive in a single hospital ward for 10 days, while war raged around them. The Indian air force repeatedly bombed the mission, which the Pakistani invaders were using as a transport and supplies depot. The two older boys eventually returned to Britain by boat. James, the baby, was so weak he was not expected to survive. He was initially cared for by Lady Messervy, the wife of the British general who had become the first commander-in-chief of the Pakistan army, and slowly began to improve. When, a few months later, he was well enough to make the journey home, he was taken in by a different wing of the family. He didn't see a lot of his older brothers as they were growing up and at 18 he emigrated to South Africa. ""We never talked much about our parents - we knew the bare facts of what happened, but we were encouraged not to dwell on it,"" says Doug Dykes, a brewer by profession who lives in Dorking, just outside London. It was only when I made contact with the family, sent photos of the graves and sought their testimony, that the brothers started to talk among themselves about their memories and feelings, he tells me. St Joseph's lies at the western end of Indian-administered Kashmir, where the mountains start to close in on the valley. The road from the Kashmiri capital, Srinagar, is lined by Indian army bases and choked with the incessant movement of the huge numbers of troops deployed to ensure that neither Pakistan nor Kashmiri separatists prise the region from Indian control. Today there are 13 nuns at St Joseph's, all Indian - though none Kashmiri. In 1947 all except one were from Europe. As well as the  small hospital - now, as then, specialising in maternal and women's health - they run a nursing institute which is currently training 67 local Kashmiri girls. The nuns recount how at times in recent years, as the security situation worsened, they have been encouraged to pull out of Baramulla. But they have insisted on staying. The service they provide to the local community is clearly appreciated, as is the evident compassion with which they conduct their mission. For the 70th anniversary of the killings, the nuns took it on themselves to organise a memorial mass, candle-bearing processions and the laying of wreaths to honour those who lost their lives. They invited the two surviving Dykes children to attend and asked if I would come along too.  The army has spruced up the graves for the occasion - a touch of whitewash, a few additional pot plants and camouflage sheets to protect those gathering around the graves. The quiet of the occasion is broken by the whirr of an army surveillance drone overhead, keeping an eye out for intruders. Col Dykes lies in the only Commonwealth war grave in Kashmir, and the top-ranking Indian general in the area places a wreath, as does the diocesan bishop and the provincial head of the nuns' order. The Dykes sons both lay wreaths too - Doug makes a point of honouring his mother. For Doug and James Dykes, the warmth of the welcome from the nuns and the poignancy of the ceremonies is overpowering. James, who stayed in South Africa and made a career as a tax consultant, is able to visit the room where his mother gave birth to him, as well as seeing the spot his parents were buried just two weeks later.  ""I'm gobsmacked by it all. I just can't find the words,"" he says.  ""I never expected to make it here."" Neither of the surviving brothers can be sure to make it to Kashmir again. It was a precious chance - possibly a last chance - to get close to the young couple who died here, and whom they have thought about all their lives.

Hawkish,The 11 BEST moments from Oscars night,2024-09-25,2018-03-05,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-43286325,"We all know who won the awards at the Oscars but who were the stars who won the night on social media?  He missed out on the best actor award to Gary Oldman but Timothee Chalamet was the most tweeted about celebrity on the red carpet, according to Twitter. He certainly looked like he was having the most fun.  James Ivory, who won the best adapted screenplay Oscar for Call Me By Your Name, in which Timothee starred, wore his face on his shirt - which went down a storm.  His reunion with his Call Me By Your Name co-star Armie Hammer on the red carpet also made a lot of people very happy. There was a lot of love for Timothee at the ceremony too and it seems he made sure he introduced his mum (aaaw!) to all the big names.   They weren't eligible to be nominated for this year's Oscars but the cast of Black Panther didn't let that stop them from reigning supreme on the red carpet, with the resulting hashtag #WakandaForever.  Chadwick Boseman was the second most tweeted about star on the red carpet.  He and his co-stars Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, Daniel Kaluuya and Winston Duke looked like Wakandan royalty. Danai Gurira and Lupita Nyong'o also had a good old catch up with Daniel Kaluuya on the red carpet. Tiffany Haddish also had a moment on the red carpet - and pretty much everywhere else she went at the Oscars.  She arrived in a traditional Eritrean dress to pay tribute to her dad who died last year, before changing her outfit to present an award with Maya Rudolph.  It was a more traditional affair... apart from the furry slippers. A lot of people on Twitter had time for those. Tiffany and Maya's double act went down a storm and many are convinced they should host next year.  Haddish changed her dress yet again for the after parties, where she and best actress winner Frances McDormand shared an... erm, interesting greeting.  Haddish also caused a stir on the red carpet when she crossed the velvet ropes to get to greet Meryl Streep.   Another star who wouldn't let barriers stop them seeing the Hollywood matriarch was Jennifer Lawrence.  Extra points for balancing the wine glass.  This year's set design drew a lot of attention on Twitter.   To celebrate the 90th anniversary of the awards, set designer Derek McLane used 45 million crystals in his sets - each of which was meant to reflect a different era in the history of movie making.   Jillian Leff was one who tweeted: ""I don't care about anything except the stage design"". Many suggested it should be up for an award in itself - including Katy Perry.  But not everyone was so keen - Jen Castle was one: ""I'm sorry but there's way too much going on with the set design tonight. It's like the Rococo era threw up on the stage"". History was made at the Oscars when Daniela Vega took to the stage - she became the first openly trans woman presenter in Oscars history when she introduced Sufjan Stevens's performance of Mystery of Love from Call Me By Your Name.  Her film A Fantastic Woman also won the best foreign film Oscar.   Patricia Arquette, whose late sister Alexis Arquette was a trans pioneer, was particularly happy.  The Shape of Water Director Guillermo del Toro was the second most tweeted-about star at the ceremony.  He won best director and best film. But after last year's mess up, he was taking no chances and checked his envelope to make sure.  Host Jimmy Kimmel's offer of a jet ski to whoever did the shortest speech went down well.  Dame Helen Mirren had the job of modelling the prize.  The winner was Mark Bridges who won best costume design for Phantom Thread. His speech comprised four words: ""Thank you very much"".  His happy face is now all over Twitter... He told the BBC's Rebecca Jones that it's all official but he has no idea how to get the vehicle home.   Her flowing royal blue gown landed her on the Oscars best dressed list but it seems Jennifer Garner will be remembered for the moment she had a life-changing revelation, mid-ceremony. Left the hob on? Forgot to pick up mum en route to the ceremony?? We REALLY want to find out what she was thinking about. The actress turned heads at the Vanity Fair party when she revealed a massive tattoo demonstrating her commitment to the Time's Up movement.  It got everyone talking - partly because it was Hermione with a massive tattoo - but also because it didn't adhere to standard punctuation rules. There was also much debate over whether or not it was real tattoo. The consensus seems to be it's semi-permanent. She might have to add the apostrophe with a sharpie.   Finally, a social media star who wasn't even at the Oscars.  We're guessing the Home Alone actor wasn't invited to the big event but that didn't stop him from dressing up at home as if he was.  He tweeted for seven hours - making a lot of jokes and quite a few digs at male stars tied to sexual harassment charges in the movie world. Praised as ""brilliantly cynical"" he likely gained a lot more followers but with lines like this we're not sure he'll be getting an invite to next year's award either.

Hawkish,Cuba opens up its economy to private businesses,2024-09-25,2021-02-07,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-55967709,"Cuba has announced it will allow private businesses to operate in most sectors, in what is a major reform to its state-controlled economy. Labour Minister Marta Elena Feito said the list of authorised activities had expanded from 127 to more than 2,000.  Only a minority of sectors would be reserved for the state, she said. The communist country's economy has been hit hard by the pandemic and US sanctions introduced by the Trump administration. Last year its economy shrank by 11% - its worst decline in almost three decades - and Cubans have been facing shortages of basic goods. Ms Feito said just 124 economic activities would be exempt from private involvement although she did not mention which ones. ""That private work continues to develop, is the objective of this reform,"" Ms Feito was quoted by AFP as saying. She said the move would ""help free the productive forces"" of the private sector. Experts on Cuba's tangled and complicated economy say the step essentially opens up almost all economic activity on the island to some form of private enterprise, the BBC's Will Grant in Havana says. This will be a significant shot in the arm for those families and individuals who harbour hopes of moving beyond just the very small businesses into medium-sized ventures, he notes. Apart from hundreds of thousands of small farms, Cuba's non-state sector is composed mainly of small private businesses run by artisans, taxi drivers and tradesmen. Around 600,000 people, around 13% of the workforce, joined the private sector when the opportunity arose. However a large number of private businesses are involved in the island's tourist industry, which has been hard hit by the pandemic and sanctions. Given how slowly reforms tend to move in Cuba, it may still be some time before the change is noticeable in daily economic life, our correspondent says. Some 60 years of hostility between the US and Cuba were eased in 2015 when then US President Obama and Cuban leader Raul Castro agreed to normalise relations, allowing US citizens to visit the island and empowering local businesses. But Obama's efforts were rolled back by his successor, President Donald Trump, with the support of hawkish Cuban-Americans who saw Mr Obama's historic opening as an appeasement of Castro's communist regime. New US President Joe Biden - who was Barack Obama's vice-president - has previously signalled that he wants to improve US-Cuban relations but observers say it is not clear how high it might be on his priority list."

Hawkish,Trump hails CIA chief's secret mission,2024-09-25,2018-04-18,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-43811374,"CIA director Mike Pompeo forged a ""good relationship"" with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un when they met last week, US President Donald Trump has tweeted. Confirming media reports of the secret meeting in Pyongyang, Mr Trump said it had gone ""very smoothly"". The surprise visit marks the highest-level contact between the United States and North Korea since 2000.  Mr Trump is expected to hold a summit with Mr Kim by June. Details are being worked out, the US president said. South Korea has also signalled that it may pursue a formal resolution of the longstanding conflict on the peninsula. President Moon Jae-in and Mr Kim are due to meet next week.  The US president earlier gave his ""blessing"" for the talks between the South and North to discuss a peace treaty to formally end the 1950-1953 Korean War. Mr Pompeo's trip took place after he was nominated by Mr Trump to replace Rex Tillerson as secretary of state. Very little is known about the talks other than that they were to prepare for the forthcoming Trump-Kim summit.  Mr Pompeo is predicted to be confirmed as the top US diplomat by the Republican-controlled Senate in the coming weeks, although Democratic opposition to the conservative's candidacy is strong.  Senator Robert Menendez, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, said he did not think Mr Pompeo's ""past sentiments"" reflected American values. The hawkish CIA chief is known for his opposition to same-sex marriage and has made controversial remarks about Islam.  The US does not have diplomatic relations with North Korea, although diplomats have visited in the past and so-called ""back channels"" are used to communicate with Pyongyang. The last senior US official to meet a North Korean leader was Madeleine Albright, who was secretary of state when she travelled to Pyongyang for talks with Kim Jong-il, the father of the current leader.  In 2014, the then-head of National Intelligence James Clapper visited North Korea in a secret mission to negotiate the release of two US citizens. Mr Clapper did not meet the North Korean leader.  Mr Trump stunned the international community last month by accepting Pyongyang's suggestion for direct talks. It would be unprecedented for a sitting US president to meet a North Korean leader.  He said the summit would take place either in early June or ""a little before that"" and that several sites were under consideration.  Analysts have speculated that a location for talks could be the Demilitarised Zone between North and South Korea, another Asian country, or a neutral European country.  North Korea has been isolated for decades because of its human rights abuses and pursuit of nuclear weapons, in defiance of international laws and UN sanctions. It has carried out six nuclear tests, and has missiles that it says could reach the US. But South Korea's hosting of the Winter Olympics in February gave an unexpected window for diplomacy, and in the weeks since there have been a flurry of visits to the North from China, South Korea and now the US.  News of Mr Pompeo's visit is likely to overshadow delicate talks with Japan, a key US ally and neighbour of North Korea.  There have been fears in Tokyo that Mr Trump's plans for bilateral talks could sideline Japan, and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is currently in Florida for talks with the US leader. Relations between the two men appeared cordial on this, the second time that Mr Trump has welcomed Mr Abe to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. Mr Trump insisted on Tuesday that the two countries were ""very unified on the subject of North Korea"", and Mr Abe praised the US president's handling of the North Korea issue. However, observers say Mr Abe's goal for his US trip will be to persuade the US president as much as he can not to sway from the West's hard line on Pyongyang."
Hawkish,Devon and Cornwall schools listed for improvement,2024-09-25,2022-12-16,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-63999586,"Eleven schools in Devon and Cornwall have been listed for rebuilding work by the government. The schools, including Tiverton High School and Swimbridge Primary School in Devon, are on the School Rebuilding Programme. Tiverton High School, which was built in 1959, has suffered a number of structural problems. Swimbridge Primary will be moving to a new site after concerns about ground above the school moving down the hill. Tipton St John Primary School, which has seen numerous incidents of flooding over the years, will get a new building under the School Rebuilding Programme, which the government says has invested more than £13bn to maintain and improve schools since 2015. Built in 1843, Tipton St John Primary consists of two separate buildings, a lower site for younger pupils, and an upper facility for older students. Around 95 pupils currently attend the school. However, the school has been hit by flooding in the past, with pupils even being evacuated due to the severity. Such is the school's susceptibility to future flooding, the Environment Agency and the Department for Education have warned that lives could be at risk. The Devon and Cornwall schools listed for improvements are: Devon Jon Sowden, Tiverton High School's estate manager, told BBC Radio Devon in August that there were ""large amounts of concrete crumbling"" at the school, along with asbestos. All external doors needed to be replaced, plaster was falling off and a roof was ""crumbling away"", he added. Richard Foord, Liberal Democrat MP for Tiverton and Honiton, said: ""This is a moment the community has long been waiting for. ""I won't rest until there are shovels in the ground."" Selaine Saxby, Conservative MP for North Devon, said it had been a difficult time for staff and students at Swimbridge Primary and she was very pleased that the school would ""have the new school it so clearly needs and deserves"". Colin Butler, executive headteacher of Tipton St John Primary School, said it was ""such a relief to know that staff and pupils will never need to worry for the safety of all every time there is heavy rain"" and he was delighted that the school had been listed for improvements.

Hawkish,Tom Tugendhat: From wars to front line at Westminster,2024-09-25,2022-07-15,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-62177286,"Like some of the other contenders, Tom Tugendhat was not a name widely known to the British public when the Conservative leadership race began.  MP for Tonbridge and Malling in Kent since 2015, he was the only person to make it through to the final five contenders not to hold ministerial office. But the former army officer was knocked out in the third round of voting, having received 31 votes. Mr Tugendhat has cultivated a reputation at Westminster for holding the government to account for its conduct of foreign affairs from Afghanistan to Ukraine in his role as chairman of the foreign affairs select committee.  His criticisms have often been regarded as carrying extra weight because of his role as an officer in the Territorial Army, seving in both the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts, where he was involved in several front line operations.  Before entering politics, he also worked as a journalist and as a public relations consultant in Lebanon. Back in the UK he was a management consultant and an adviser to the Chief of the Defence Staff.     Mr Tugendhat, who is 49, was born in Westminster, the son of a High Court judge and his French wife. He is a nephew of Conservative peer Christopher Tugendhat, a former vice-president of the European Commission.  He holds dual British and French citizenship. His wife is a French judge and senior civil servant. He was educated at a private school and studied theology at Bristol University, before completing a Master's degree in Islamic studies at Cambridge and learning Arabic in Yemen. In Parliament, he's a member of the One Nation group of Conservative MPs, who see themselves as socially liberal centrists.   In the Brexit referendum, Mr Tugendhat voted to remain in the European Union. He later backed the withdrawal agreement negotiated by Theresa May on each of the three occasions it was put to a vote. He was highly critical of the Nato withdrawal from Afghanistan in August 2021. As Kabul fell to the Taliban and Western countries scrambled to evacuate their nationals and Afghans who had helped them, Mr Tugendhat described what was happening as Britain's ""biggest foreign policy disaster since Suez"". He has been hawkish on a number of foreign policy issues - accusing Iran of arming terrorists around the world and advocating stronger action against Russia even before its invasion of Ukraine.  He has been particularly critical of China. In 2020, he co-founded the China Research Group of mainly Conservative MPs to gain a ""better understanding of China's economic ambitions and global role"".  Pressure from the group helped persuade the government to change its mind about allowing the Chinese telecoms firm Huawei to have a role in the UK's 5G wireless networks.  In March 2021, Mr Tugendhat was one of five MPs to be sanctioned by China for spreading what it called ""lies and disinformation"". He was later banned from entering China.  He has often had a strained relationship with Boris Johnson and backed Michael Gove in the 2019 Tory leadership contest.   During the current leadership campaign, Mr Tugendhat has promised to cut national insurance, to reduce fuel duty by 10p a litre and to increase tax incentives for business investment,  He has pledged to increase spending on defence to 3% of national income, saying national security must come before ""bean counters and spreadsheets"". In common with the other candidates, he has said he would retain the government's policy of sending some asylum seekers to Rwanda, despite fierce opposition from campaigners.   ""The Rwanda solution is not one anyone would have initially chosen, but the reality is you cannot have rewards for criminality and illegal action,"" he said.  In the first ballot of Tory MPs, M Tugendhat secured 37 votes. That fell to 32 votes in Thursday's second round. "

Teignbridge Council said construction on the project to link 860 new homes to the A379 Exeter Road is due for completion by summer 2024. It said landowners and developers had signed contracts for the project which included safeguarding for wildlife such as bats and otters. Councillor Martin Wrigley, Teignbridge Council leader, said Dawlish residents had waited seven years for the scheme. ""To build the link road and bridge has required agreements to be reached with various landowners and the cooperation of developers,"" he said. ""I would like to thank everyone who has worked so hard to get the project to this stage."" Since government funding for the project was first agreed in 2019, planning permission has been granted for homes on either side of the Shutterton Brook and for the proposed bridge. Led by Montel Civil Engineering, the link road is also due to feature a bus route, cycling lanes and footpaths. There is an environmental plan connected to the project and developed alongside Natural England and the Environment Agency.  This includes safeguarding measures for bats, dormice, nesting birds, otters and water voles and reusing construction material, the council said. Councillor Andrea Davis, Devon County Council cabinet member for climate change, environment and transport, said the link was ""key to access new homes"". She added: ""Once this main section of road and the bridge have been built as part of this scheme, the developer-funded section of link road running through Gatehouse Farm to Elm Grove Road is expected to be completed afterwards."" The plan for ""at least 860 homes"" on land to the north-west of Dawlish was mentioned in the local plan (2013- 2033) with a target of 25% affordable homes, along with a range of social and community facilities.

The renowned physicist died in March, at the age of 76, after a long battle with motor neurone disease. Ten UK Research and Innovation Stephen Hawking Fellowships will be awarded for the next five years in the fields of maths, physics and computer sciences. The professor's family said it was a ""great tribute to his life in science"". Science Minister Sam Gyimah said: ""[They] will allow exceptional graduate students in maths, physics and computer science in institutions across the UK to take their work even further."" The funding will allow the students to continue their work in any UK institution for up to three years. ""I can think of no more fitting tribute to this great man than to support the next generation to push the boundaries of knowledge of the laws that govern our universe,"" Mr Gyimah added. The fellowships were created in consultation with the professor's family, who said: ""Our father knew the value that fellowships could provide to advancing research. ""He was very interested in the development of new talent and devoted much of his career to his teaching roles. ""We are thrilled that these fellowships will be named after him and see this as a great tribute to his life in science."" Prof Hawking died in Cambridge on 14 March and thousands lined the streets of the city for his funeral later that month. His ashes will be interred between Sir Isaac Newton and Charles Darwin during a service of thanksgiving for his life at Westminster Abbey in London on 15 June."
Hawkish,Husband jailed for 'sadistic' attack,2024-09-25,2018-10-31,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-46048544,"An estranged husband has been jailed for a ""sadistic"" attack on his wife which saw her held hostage in her own home. Lee Corrie, of West Cliff, Dawlish, assaulted his partner repeatedly over three days, biting her thigh, and using a knife to cut her legs and arms, Exeter Crown Court heard. Corrie, 32, admitted causing actual bodily harm and criminal damage. He was jailed for one year and ten months. The attack started within hours of Corrie being given bail for earlier abuse of his wife, Jade.  She was left with cuts and bruises which a judge said went from head to toe and amounted to torture. Corrie broke strict conditions not to contact her by ringing her from Exeter prison before his release on bail on 28 September and meeting her near the gates. After returning to her flat, Corrie accused her of seeing other men.  He took her keys, told her she was his hostage, and started a long series of attacks, the court heard. Corrie stifled her screams by putting his hand over her mouth and held the knife to her throat and eyes, telling her he would blind her if she called for help. Sentencing, Judge David Evans told Corrie: ""It would appear on the face of it that in a sadistic action, you dragged a knife across her legs. You bit her leg, causing a tell-tale round bruise. ""You harmed her badly and terrorised her. She was covered from head to toe in cuts and bruises. You assaulted and terrorised her over a long time. ""The way you treated her was akin to torture. You used a knife and your teeth as weapons."" He imposed a restraining order banning Corrie from any further contact with his wife or her mother for three years."

A total of 22 items owned by the physicist, who died in March, are being sold by Christie's over nine days. They include an early wheelchair and a script for one of Prof Hawking's appearances on The Simpsons. A specialist said the items represent the ""ultimate triumph of scientific brilliance over adversity"". The extraordinary thesis, which is signed twice and inscribed by the scientist in the year he was diagnosed with motor neurone disease, is expected to fetch as much as £150,000. The sale includes medals, awards and scientific papers. Prof Hawking's book, A Brief History of Time, which he signed with a thumbprint in 1988, is guided at £2,000 to £3,000. The physicist's daughter, Lucy, said Christie's had been helping the family ""manage our beloved father's unique and precious collection of personal and professional belongings"". The ""earliest surviving example"" of one of Prof Hawking's motorised wheelchairs, which he used from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s, could fetch up to £15,000 for charity. Proceeds from the sale of the red leather chair, with one footrest, will go to the Stephen Hawking Foundation and the Motor Neurone Disease Association. Sophie Hopkins, specialist in manuscripts and archives at Christie's, said much of the collection was ""incredibly iconic"". ""Once Hawking realised his diagnosis was not a death sentence, he set about his work with a renewed sense of vigour,"" she said. ""It is the ultimate triumph of scientific brilliance over adversity.

Hawkish,Sea defences change 'may have accelerated erosion',2024-09-25,2019-12-18,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-50837724,"The Environment Agency (EA) has admitted its decision to remove some hard sea defences may have accelerated erosion at Dawlish Warren in Devon.  In 2017, the EA replaced the hard rock defences with giant tubes filled with sand, known as a Geotube.  However, the recent stormy weather has left a section of the new defences exposed. The EA has now installed temporary measures to protect the 460m (1,509ft) Geotube. A nearby golf course said the situation had deteriorated since the metal baskets filled with rocks, called gabions, were removed.  Warren Golf Club manager John Langmead said he wished the original defences had been left in.  Dawlish Warren provides a natural breakwater which protects the Exe Estuary, nearby villages and main railway line from the sea. The EA said it would keep a close eye on the tides and weather until a long-term solution was found.  It added it was legally obliged to remove the old hard flood defences, but its prediction models did not reflect the strength of recent winter storms.   The EA also said the scheme was designed to reduce flooding risk and damage to the railway line, as well as improve the local dune habitat. Martin Davies, from the agency, said: ""There weren't mistakes, the design was based on predictions which obviously we've established were incorrect."" ""But the elements of the scheme that reduce flood risk to the wider estuary and locally were a success,"" he added."
Hawkish,Ten names to keep an eye on in Parliament,2024-09-25,2019-12-15,By Mark D'Arcy,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50786212,"Parliament tends to be dominated by its grandest figures, the party leaders, and their cabinet or shadow cabinet teams.  But others can cut a dash in the Commons by weight of expertise, through passion for an issue, by sheer street-smarts, or simply by being in the right place at the right time. So here are a few MPs who - while not aspiring to the top table - could exert serious leverage in the newly elected House of Commons. After a strong performance in the race to succeed John Bercow as Speaker - and in a House of Commons with many more Conservatives - she must surely be the front runner to become Chairman of Ways and Means, the senior deputy speaker. She would then have the key responsibilities of chairing budget debates and selecting amendments for consideration by committees of the whole house - a key task when the government begins to push through its Withdrawal Agreement Bill.  He pulled off a considerable coup in 2017, when, as a junior backbencher, he wrested the chairmanship of the Foreign Affairs Committee from ex-minister Crispin Blunt.  An ex-army officer - he served in Iraq and Afghanistan - Tugendhat writes notes to himself on an office whiteboard in Arabic to preserve privacy. He's a reasonable bet for a ministerial job, perhaps in the Foreign Office.  Hawkish on Russia - he said the Salisbury poisoning was ""if not an act of war… certainly a warlike act by the Russian Federation"" - expect him to be an influential voice on foreign policy if he remains on the backbenches.  Chairwoman of the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee - where she performed impressively - she is being tipped as the person around whom the remains of the Blairite-Brownite group of Labour MPs might coalesce.  That may not translate into an attempt on the leadership, but she may now become an important factional leader. Few MPs come into Parliament with a clearly defined policy mission, but the ex-army officer who won Plymouth Moor View against the expectations of his own party, announced himself with a blistering maiden speech on the need for better care for military veterans.  He was an early backer of Boris Johnson's leadership campaign and was frequently seen shepherding the would-be leader around Westminster. His support was rewarded with the job he always wanted - defence minister responsible for veterans. Mercer will expect the political support and funding to reform the system.  Briefly Leader of the House in the dog days of Theresa May's premiership, the former Treasury minister found himself surplus to requirements when Boris Johnson took over. But with gazelle-like agility, he leapt into the vacancy created when Nicky Morgan left as chairwoman of the Treasury Committee.  He didn't have much time to make an impact in this key committee corridor job before the election was called, but if he is re-elected as Parliament's scrutiniser-in-chief of economic policy (and others may cast covetous eyes on the post) he will get to pronounce on levels of spending and public debt at a ticklish moment for the UK economy. Double-hatted as Metro Mayor of South Yorkshire and MP for Barnsley Central. In a Parliament where one of the big themes looks certain to be devolution - and demands for greater powers for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - the mayor of a fair chunk of left-behind territory could find himself ""speaking for England"".  Once talked up as a possible Labour leadership contender, he defied pressure to give up his Commons seat and maintains a perch in Westminster. He is a Parachute Regiment veteran with service in Kosovo, Iraq and Afghanistan.  Seen as a bit of a star of the 2017 intake, Afolami is on the Commons end of the Constitution Reform Group, a cross-party pressure group which wants to rebalance a constitution destabilised by an uneven devolution settlement.  This is the group behind the Act of Union Bill, a private member's bill proposed by the former clerk of the Commons, Lord Lisvane. It may all sound high-powered and rather nerdy, but the tug of war between the nations and regions of the UK is set to be a big theme of the new Parliament, and Afolami looks set to be a player.  Smart, personable, and articulate in two languages he seized and held a seat which has see-sawed between Plaid and the Lib Dems since the 1990s. In his maiden speech, he complained of the steady, silent haemorrhage of young people leaving their communities to seek opportunities elsewhere. A future leader? Newly elected, he is nonetheless an experienced figure, having served in the European Parliament since 2004. He looks ready-made to become the SNP's new Brexit spokesman in Westminster. She contested the most marginal seat in the country (the SNP won with a majority of just two votes in 2017) in North East Fife.  An ex-police officer who is already attracting rave reviews. Part of an infusion of new blood into a rather bruised and diminished Lib Dem parliamentary contingent. Those leaving Parliament include Dr Sarah Wollaston, a GP who was originally elected as a Conservative in 2010 but ended up in the Lib Dems, by way of the short-lived Independent Group of MPs. Labour's Frank Field, a maverick Labour MP, almost permanently at odds with his constituency party, and the SNP's Stephen Gethins, who might have been a candidate to lead their Westminster group had he enjoyed a more comfortable majority, also both lost their seats.  Labour's Mary Creagh led a series of high-profile inquiries into the environmental issues around the fashion industry and toxic chemicals in everyday life. And Dennis Skinner - the Labour stalwart would have been the father of the House, the longest serving MP, had he survived the election - also departs. He was first elected in 1970, and fell just short of half a century in the Commons. "

Hawkish,Film review: Furious 7,2024-09-25,2015-03-25,Nicholas Barber,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20150325-furious-7-running-on-empty,"The late Paul Walker’s final installment of the Fast & Furious franchise opens soon in cinemas – but the movie may make you carsick, writes critic Nicholas Barber. Maybe it’s appropriate for a film in which so many super-charged hot-rods make screeching U-turns, but Furious 7 never stops swerving recklessly between two very different moods. Just when you’re settling into a proudly silly action movie, somebody will make a grave speech about the importance of family. Then, just when you think that it’s actually a sober film set in the real world, someone will drive a car out of a plane and land safely on a mountain road several thousand feet below. And then, just when you’ve accepted that it’s a Road Runner cartoon with added tattoos, a sombre scene will remind you that one of its stars, Paul Walker, died while the film was in production. The tonal lurches are so extreme that some viewers are bound to get whiplash. The first film in the series, 2001’s The Fast and the Furious, was a relatively plausible thriller about an FBI agent (Walker) going undercover in a gang of illegal street racers. But every sequel has been bigger and dafter than the one before, and we’ve now got to the stage where Furious 7 is a cross between Tom Cruise’s Mission: Impossible franchise and Sylvester Stallone’s The Expendables. Like Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol, it’s a high-tech global espionage caper featuring lots of computer hacking and a skyscraper in the United Arab Emirates. And like The Expendables, it is a dopey buddy movie packed with trigger-happy action heroes: in this instalment, Kurt Russell, Tony Jaa and Jason Statham (an Expendable himself) join a musclebound roster that already includes Vin Diesel, Dwayne Johnson and Michelle Rodriguez. Put those two franchises together and you get a film so extravagantly ludicrous that it could easily be a parody of Hollywood’s adolescent excesses. The majority of the dialogue consists of trailer-friendly, macho slogans; the male characters have biceps that would put the Hulk to shame; the female characters are usually filmed at buttock-level as they strut away from the camera in bikinis; and the plotting is head-achingly stupid, right from the opening scene. But nothing in the film is as preposterous as the digitally-enhanced action sequences, all of which ignore the laws of physics. Again and again, cars are smashed through glass walls, perforated with bullets, and thrown downward at breakneck speed, and yet the drivers are always fine and dandy. Even more remarkably, no innocent bystanders are affected by the destruction. In the explosion-heavy finale, much of downtown Los Angeles is razed, but someone seems to have had the foresight to evacuate the city first. Need for speed This logic-free, consequence-free property damage is never very involving. Once Diesel’s character has driven his car over the edge of a cliff, only to emerge at the bottom without a scratch, it’s safe to assume that alien invaders could obliterate the planet and he would walk away unscathed. (Something to look forward to in Fast & Furious 8, perhaps.) But if you are partial to amoral, petrolhead mayhem, there is no doubt that Furious 7 delivers the goods. It races from set piece to outrageous set piece at a pedal-to-the-metal pace, and the gleeful verve of the action just about compensates for its senselessness. The snag is, though, that the film isn’t satisfied with being a numbskulled, testosterone-drenched fantasy. It insists on being a mushy sermon on the virtues of friendship and domesticity, too. Like The Expendables and its sequels, it spends most of its running time trivialising violence, and its remaining minutes being sentimental about the heroes’ brotherly bonds. The death of one gang member is treated as an agonizing crime against humanity, and whenever Walker’s character talks to his wife (Jordana Brewster), their exchanges are so morbid and mawkish that you would think he had been diagnosed with a terminal illness. The film keeps telling us that we shouldn’t take any of it seriously, but it also keeps telling us that we should take it very seriously indeed. This flip-flopping would be jarring enough in any circumstances, but it’s especially painful in the wake of Walker’s death in a car accident in 2013. The screenplay was rewritten, and his scenes were rejigged, so that the film would serve as an emotional farewell to the actor and the character. And while the frequent references to his demise verge on the ghoulish, they certainly have the desired effect. At the screening I attended, the final valedictory montage had grown men wiping their eyes. But there’s no getting away from the horrible irony that Walker died in a Porsche being driven at twice the speed limit. And there’s no denying the hypocrisy of a film that is both a tear-jerking tribute to a star killed by dangerous driving, and a meat-headed farce which asserts that dangerous driving is no riskier than a game of hopscotch. Furious 7 is sure to be the most lucrative entry of the series. But if you give it any thought at all, it will leave you feeling carsick. ★★☆☆☆ If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter."
Hawkish,Our favourite thing?,2024-09-25,2015-03-02,Nicholas Barber,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20150302-our-favourite-thing,"The musical story of the von Trapp family continues to delight audiences 50 years on. But what makes The Sound of Music endure? Nicholas Barber finds out. Never mind Neil Patrick Harris’s underpants or Patricia Arquette’s politics; the show-stopping moment at this year’s Academy Awards came when Lady Gaga sang a medley to celebrate the 50th anniversary of The Sound of Music. Who would have predicted it? There on the stage was the avant-garde electropop star who once wore a dress made of raw meat swishing around in a white ball gown, belting out My Favourite Things in a cut-glass English accent. It was a testament to Gaga’s ability to reinvent herself. But The Sound of Music is just as adept at moving with the times. The events that inspired the film took place in Austria in the 1920s and 1930s. Maria von Trapp’s memoir of those events was published in 1949, and was turned into a stage musical by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II 10 years later. Then came the film. It premiered in 1965, just a few months before The Beatles’ second film, Help! But although we think of The Beatles as dominating the Swinging ‘60s, it was The Sound of Music that was the Oscar-winning smash – and its soundtrack album was the UK’s best-selling LP, not just in 1965, but in 1966 and 1968. The film’s march through the decades doesn’t stop there. In the 1970s and beyond, it was a holiday television staple. In the 1990s, it became the focus of Rocky Horror-style fancy-dress singalong nights. In critics’ polls, Singin’ in The Rain may be held up as the finest of all Hollywood musicals. But the most popular is indisputably The Sound of Music. In an effort to understand the film’s eternal appeal, I thought I should rewatch it on DVD. But then a question struck me: had I ever actually watched it in the first place? I knew I’d seen excerpts from it on clip shows over the years, and I had hazy memories of catching some of it on television on a rainy Sunday afternoon, but I wasn’t sure that I’d ever watched it from start to finish. And I suspect I’m not the only person in that position. We’ve all seen so many snippets and parodies that The Sound of Music is a part of our lives whether we’ve watched it or not. We can hum along to the title song, not to mention Do-Re-Mi and Climb Ev’ry Mountain. We can picture its heroine radiating wholesomeness as she gambols through the Alps, arms outstretched, apron swirling. Most of us can have a stab at summarising the plot, too. A hearty trainee nun called Maria (Julie Andrews) is hired to look after the seven von Trapp children in a Salzburg schloss. She goes on to thaw the heart of the children’s widowed father (Christopher Plummer). But what else happens? Apart from the few scenes and the many songs that are burnt into our brains, what exactly does The Sound of Music entail? The short answer is: not a lot. What surprised me when I finally watched the film last month was that if you’ve seen bits and pieces of it, then you’ve pretty much seen the whole thing. True, the von Trapps have to flee from the Nazis in the last half-hour – a sequence which is almost entirely separate from everything beforehand – but otherwise, there’s not much that happens. Going for a song It’s certainly not a film to watch for its narrative twists and turns. How does Maria win over the hostile von Trapp children? With one rendition of My Favourite Things. What convinces Captain von Trapp that she is a positive influence on his offspring? A performance of The Lonely Goatherd. And what convinces the audience that the captain has been influenced by Maria? A recital of Edelweiss. Compared to the elaborate musicals that made Andrews a star of stage (My Fair Lady) and screen (Mary Poppins), The Sound of Music is more of a concert than a film – a series of catchy Rodgers and Hammerstein numbers linked by some crisp repartee. But that isn’t a criticism. The fact that The Sound of Music resembles a greatest hits album could be the key to its record-breaking success. “In many ways, The Sound of Music follows the classic musical structure that highlights its musical numbers over plot,” says Professor Caryl Flinn of the University Of Michigan, author of a new British Film Institute guide to The Sound of Music. “Cinema scholars in fact have grouped musicals along with porno and horror films for that reason – storylines aren’t generally what draw people in to watch these genres. In porno and horror, it’s all about getting to the next sex scene and the next scare; and in musicals, it’s all about getting to the next song. With The Sound of Music, songs are the real anchor for audiences’ feelings.” It’s the film’s concentration on its peerless songs which accounts for the Sing-a-long Sound of Music phenomenon. In 1999, London’s Prince Charles Cinema started screening it every Friday evening, and encouraged audiences to dress up as the characters. The format has since been exported to cinemas all around the globe. The song-based structure also helps to explain why the film is a television fixture. From a TV station’s point of view, the songs make The Sound of Music easy to chop up into advertising-friendly chunks. From the viewer’s perspective, you can switch it on halfway through, and you won’t have any difficulty picking up the story. ‘Restraint and reserve’ And it isn’t just the plot that has been stripped back to basics. The film’s director and screenwriter, Robert Wise and Ernest Lehman, made West Side Story in 1961, but while that musical bursts with heightened colours and balletic dance routines, The Sound of Music has almost no choreography beyond some decorous waltzing, and no visual flair beyond the scenic shots of sunny Salzburg. “There is so much restraint and reserve in The Sound of Music,” says Professor Flinn. “I think it reflects the production team’s desire to go for simplicity and sincerity, and not risk courting anything too over-the-top or kitschy.” Given that Plummer has spent decades decrying the film’s sickly sweetness, it might seem strange to hear it described in terms of simplicity and restraint, but Professor Flinn could be on to something. The Sound of Music may feature a goat-based puppet show and a gaggle of children in matching clothes made out of curtains, but Wise and Lehman actually diluted the stage play’s syrupy sentimentality: they skip from song to song without dwelling on any of the von Trapps’ triumphs or tragedies. None of the children gets the chance to be too annoying; none of the romance is allowed to become too cloying. Andrews yomps through proceedings with no-nonsense briskness; Plummer stands back and observes them with a wry twinkle in his eye. Even the ending is restrained by today’s standards. We see the von Trapps hiking over the mountains and away from the Nazis, but there are no captions detailing what happened to them next, and no photographs of the real family. You can bet that if The Sound of Music had been made in 2015, it would have had both. Plummer himself has come to acknowledge that the film is less mawkish than it might have been. As he says in an interview in the current issue of Vanity Fair, the director “did keep it from falling over the edge into a sea of treacle”. He’s right. The Sound of Music may be on the very edge of that treacly ocean, but it never quite falls in, and it’s this miraculous balancing act that keeps us watching, even after 50 years. Just ask Lady Gaga.

Hawkish,Foo Fighters: Josh Freese joins as drummer after Taylor Hawkins’ death,2024-09-25,2023-05-22,By Emma Petrie,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-65669986,"US rock band the Foo Fighters have unveiled their new drummer following the death of Taylor Hawkins last year. In a live stream on Sunday, the band announced that Josh Freese, a longtime friend of singer Dave Grohl, will join them on their forthcoming world tour. Freese has played for a variety of top acts around the world including Devo, Guns N' Roses, Sting and The Vandals.  The band previously said they would continue performing after Hawkins died in March 2022 at the age of 50. Freese's first show with Foo Fighters will take place in New Hampshire on Wednesday, the opening leg of a global tour that will run until the autumn. It will be the first time the band have performed live since their two memorial concerts for Hawkins last September. Freese himself performed with Foo Fighters at those concerts, playing on Hawkins' drums. ""I was asked what drums I'd like to use,"" he wrote on Instagram at the time. ""Without hesitation I said, 'Taylor's drums need to be up there and I want to play on his exact set-up.'"" Other musicians including Sir Paul McCartney, Queen and Mark Ronson also paid tribute to the late drummer at the concerts. At the end of 2022, the band said: ""Without Taylor, we never would have become the band that we were. And without Taylor, we know that we're going to be a different band going forward."" No cause of death for Hawkins has been announced. A toxicology report showed traces of 10 substances in his body, including opioids, marijuana and antidepressants."
Hawkish,Wales rugby: WRU investigate eligibility of Joe Hawkins and Will Rowlands,2024-09-25,2023-04-06,BBC Sport,https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-union/65193560,"Teddy Williams (L) has been linked with Exeter, where Joe Hawkins (C) is already committed to joining Dafydd Jenkins (R) next season Professional Rugby Board (PRB) chairman Malcolm Wall says the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) is reviewing the future international eligibility of Joe Hawkins and Will Rowlands. Both will play outside Wales from the end of the 2022-23 season and neither will reach the 25-cap threshold to be certain of playing for Wales. Hawkins, with five caps, will join Exeter from Ospreys for 2023-24. Dragons lock Rowlands has 23 caps and joins Racing 92 at the end of 2022-23. Hawkins could still be deemed available for Wales by eligibility rules if he was uncapped when he signed his Exeter contract. He was first named in a national squad in October 2022, winning his first cap the following month against Australia. Exeter director of rugby Rob Baxter would not reveal when Hawkins officially signed for the English club but says he does expect the player to be available for Wales for the World Cup and beyond. ""On the face of it, he is ineligible,"" says Wall, who is also a WRU board member. ""I have seen the claims he signed before he had got capped so therefore we need to know much more detail.  ""I don't want to be drawn into hypotheticals because I would like to know the facts and we will review the situation. ""Nigel Walker has raised this issue with me on Tuesday because he became aware of it before I did. ""He and the WRU full-time staff are now trying to get to the bottom of it."" Will Rowlands has played no rugby since leaving the field injured in Wales' autumn Test against Argentina in November 2022 Rowlands is in a different situation to Hawkins because he is two caps short of the threshold as he prepares to leave Newport for Paris. The 31-year-old lock was unable to add to his tally during the 2023 Six Nations because he missed the tournament with a shoulder injury. Wales have three World Cup warm-up games in August where Rowlands could make up the numbers required, but those games fall after his Dragons current contract runs out. Rowlands was named Wales player of the season in 2022 and has become an important member of the squad since his international debut in 2020.  ""I can't give a definitive answer on that and it is also under review,"" said Wall. ""We are trying to do everything we can to make sure there is a competitive Welsh team in the Rugby World Cup whilst adhering to the rules. ""So no definitive ruling on Will at this stage, but it is a different situation to that of Joe Hawkins."" Wall believes the 25-cap rule is still beneficial to Welsh rugby after the tally was reduced from 60 in February 2023. ""When we changed the number all we did was lower the barrier, recognising the financial restrictions we placed on the clubs could reduce some people from their earning capacity,"" said Wall. ""We had to be in a balanced position in respecting the need of the individual as well as wanting to do everything we can to protect both the clubs and the national side.  ""We see this as being important for Welsh rugby. We have found more funding for the professional game for the next six years in order to give the clubs more long-term planning and focus on player development. ""What we don't want then after developing those players is them leaving for clubs in other countries.  ""We think they are better developed if they are players of national interest with the close proximity of the Wales training squad, but also they provide us with the ability to field our stars and promote the domestic game. ""That has always been the relationship between the WRU and the clubs. The WRU fund the clubs on the basis they will play a key role in nurturing current and new talent. ""It is the same with England in the principle. The English approach is different because they currently have a complete ban on players playing overseas, while New Zealand do something similar if their players want to be involved in World Cups. They work around it by offering sabbaticals in Japan and the like. ""So this is not something unique to Wales. It is an approach we take on a balanced basis on trying to look after the individual, club and national side.""

Hawkish,Sea wall to protect storm-hit rail line in Dawlish opens,2024-09-25,2023-05-25,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-65697007,"The final section of an £80m sea wall, which aims to protect a railway line, has opened. The project at Dawlish, in Devon, aims to protect the rail line that connects the south-west of England with the rest of the country, from extreme weather and rising sea levels. The new section stretches between Coastguards and Colonnade breakwaters, and links with a wall opened in 2022. In 2014, a part of the sea wall and railway line collapsed during storms. Construction began on the second section in November 2020 following completion of the first phase of the government-funded project. The new section of wall wraps around Dawlish station, where work is continuing to build an accessible footbridge with lifts for passengers. The design of the 26ft (8m) high sea wall, which is 8ft (2.5m) taller than the previous one, followed years of detailed studies, Network Rail said. The work includes 1,360ft (415m) of new promenade on Dawlish seafront. The design was developed as part of the South West Rail Resilience Programme, put in place after the major storm of 2014. Ewen Morrison, from Network Rail, said: ""We are absolutely delighted to be opening this new section of sea wall and would like to wholeheartedly thank the community of Dawlish for their patience and support while the construction took place close to their homes and businesses over two-and-half years.""

Hawkish,Link road works end seven-year wait for residents,2024-09-25,2023-08-13,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-66473897,"Work on a £6.2m Dawlish link road and bridge is due to start this month. Teignbridge Council said construction on the project to link 860 new homes to the A379 Exeter Road is due for completion by summer 2024. It said landowners and developers had signed contracts for the project which included safeguarding for wildlife such as bats and otters. Councillor Martin Wrigley, Teignbridge Council leader, said Dawlish residents had waited seven years for the scheme. ""To build the link road and bridge has required agreements to be reached with various landowners and the cooperation of developers,"" he said. ""I would like to thank everyone who has worked so hard to get the project to this stage."" Since government funding for the project was first agreed in 2019, planning permission has been granted for homes on either side of the Shutterton Brook and for the proposed bridge. Led by Montel Civil Engineering, the link road is also due to feature a bus route, cycling lanes and footpaths. There is an environmental plan connected to the project and developed alongside Natural England and the Environment Agency.  This includes safeguarding measures for bats, dormice, nesting birds, otters and water voles and reusing construction material, the council said. Councillor Andrea Davis, Devon County Council cabinet member for climate change, environment and transport, said the link was ""key to access new homes"". She added: ""Once this main section of road and the bridge have been built as part of this scheme, the developer-funded section of link road running through Gatehouse Farm to Elm Grove Road is expected to be completed afterwards."" The plan for ""at least 860 homes"" on land to the north-west of Dawlish was mentioned in the local plan (2013- 2033) with a target of 25% affordable homes, along with a range of social and community facilities.

Hawkish,Ten names to keep an eye on in Parliament,2024-09-25,2019-12-15,By Mark D'Arcy,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50786212,"Parliament tends to be dominated by its grandest figures, the party leaders, and their cabinet or shadow cabinet teams.  But others can cut a dash in the Commons by weight of expertise, through passion for an issue, by sheer street-smarts, or simply by being in the right place at the right time. So here are a few MPs who - while not aspiring to the top table - could exert serious leverage in the newly elected House of Commons. After a strong performance in the race to succeed John Bercow as Speaker - and in a House of Commons with many more Conservatives - she must surely be the front runner to become Chairman of Ways and Means, the senior deputy speaker. She would then have the key responsibilities of chairing budget debates and selecting amendments for consideration by committees of the whole house - a key task when the government begins to push through its Withdrawal Agreement Bill.  He pulled off a considerable coup in 2017, when, as a junior backbencher, he wrested the chairmanship of the Foreign Affairs Committee from ex-minister Crispin Blunt.  An ex-army officer - he served in Iraq and Afghanistan - Tugendhat writes notes to himself on an office whiteboard in Arabic to preserve privacy. He's a reasonable bet for a ministerial job, perhaps in the Foreign Office.  Hawkish on Russia - he said the Salisbury poisoning was ""if not an act of war… certainly a warlike act by the Russian Federation"" - expect him to be an influential voice on foreign policy if he remains on the backbenches.  Chairwoman of the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee - where she performed impressively - she is being tipped as the person around whom the remains of the Blairite-Brownite group of Labour MPs might coalesce.  That may not translate into an attempt on the leadership, but she may now become an important factional leader. Few MPs come into Parliament with a clearly defined policy mission, but the ex-army officer who won Plymouth Moor View against the expectations of his own party, announced himself with a blistering maiden speech on the need for better care for military veterans.  He was an early backer of Boris Johnson's leadership campaign and was frequently seen shepherding the would-be leader around Westminster. His support was rewarded with the job he always wanted - defence minister responsible for veterans. Mercer will expect the political support and funding to reform the system.  Briefly Leader of the House in the dog days of Theresa May's premiership, the former Treasury minister found himself surplus to requirements when Boris Johnson took over. But with gazelle-like agility, he leapt into the vacancy created when Nicky Morgan left as chairwoman of the Treasury Committee.  He didn't have much time to make an impact in this key committee corridor job before the election was called, but if he is re-elected as Parliament's scrutiniser-in-chief of economic policy (and others may cast covetous eyes on the post) he will get to pronounce on levels of spending and public debt at a ticklish moment for the UK economy. Double-hatted as Metro Mayor of South Yorkshire and MP for Barnsley Central. In a Parliament where one of the big themes looks certain to be devolution - and demands for greater powers for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - the mayor of a fair chunk of left-behind territory could find himself ""speaking for England"".  Once talked up as a possible Labour leadership contender, he defied pressure to give up his Commons seat and maintains a perch in Westminster. He is a Parachute Regiment veteran with service in Kosovo, Iraq and Afghanistan.  Seen as a bit of a star of the 2017 intake, Afolami is on the Commons end of the Constitution Reform Group, a cross-party pressure group which wants to rebalance a constitution destabilised by an uneven devolution settlement.  This is the group behind the Act of Union Bill, a private member's bill proposed by the former clerk of the Commons, Lord Lisvane. It may all sound high-powered and rather nerdy, but the tug of war between the nations and regions of the UK is set to be a big theme of the new Parliament, and Afolami looks set to be a player.  Smart, personable, and articulate in two languages he seized and held a seat which has see-sawed between Plaid and the Lib Dems since the 1990s. In his maiden speech, he complained of the steady, silent haemorrhage of young people leaving their communities to seek opportunities elsewhere. A future leader? Newly elected, he is nonetheless an experienced figure, having served in the European Parliament since 2004. He looks ready-made to become the SNP's new Brexit spokesman in Westminster. She contested the most marginal seat in the country (the SNP won with a majority of just two votes in 2017) in North East Fife.  An ex-police officer who is already attracting rave reviews. Part of an infusion of new blood into a rather bruised and diminished Lib Dem parliamentary contingent. Those leaving Parliament include Dr Sarah Wollaston, a GP who was originally elected as a Conservative in 2010 but ended up in the Lib Dems, by way of the short-lived Independent Group of MPs. Labour's Frank Field, a maverick Labour MP, almost permanently at odds with his constituency party, and the SNP's Stephen Gethins, who might have been a candidate to lead their Westminster group had he enjoyed a more comfortable majority, also both lost their seats.  Labour's Mary Creagh led a series of high-profile inquiries into the environmental issues around the fashion industry and toxic chemicals in everyday life. And Dennis Skinner - the Labour stalwart would have been the father of the House, the longest serving MP, had he survived the election - also departs. He was first elected in 1970, and fell just short of half a century in the Commons. "

The rod-jointed toys named the Roosevelt Bears had been owned by one family since 1904, but ""not played with much"".  Auctioneers in Gloucestershire had to X-ray them to check their rare joints. The bears were sold with an original copy of Seymour Eaton's storybook, the Roosevelt Bears, from where they got their names. Auctioneers Dominic Winter said rod bears were rare and having a well-preserved pair at auction was ""an exceptional occurrence"". Susanna Winters, toys and games specialist at the auction house, said: ""The only way to prove they were rod bears was to get them X-rayed.  ""I arrived at the vets with a bag of teddies and explained what we wanted... the vet staff were as jubilant as I was when the X-ray confirmed our hopes."" Teddy B and Teddy G, as they are known, were originally bought in the United States. The anonymous seller remembered ""not being allowed to handle them as a child"" and said for some years the bears ""had been confined to an old trunk"", the auction house said.

Part of the line, which runs along a stretch of beach at Dawlish in Devon, was washed away by the sea in February 2014. It left Cornwall and most of Devon without a railway line to the rest of the country for several weeks. Network Rail said the wall will ""protect the town and region for at least the next 100 years"". The line, which was designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, was left dangling in the air by the storm. It was reopened eight weeks later and then the work started on creating a new £80m sea wall to give the line long-term protection. In May 2019 Network Rail started construction. It completed the first section, which runs for 1,180ft (360m) along Marine Parade west of Dawlish station, in July 2020.  Network Rail said further storms since completion of the first phase had ""showed the wall's effectiveness"", with waves ""successfully being deflected back out to sea"". Work on a second section of the wall, which will protect the eastern side of the station, started in November and is ""progressing well"", said Network Rail. A major part of the work has involved an eight-legged, walking jack-up barge, known as a Wavewalker, which has been used to drive piles into the ground. Alison Foden, Mayor of Dawlish, said the work was ""vitally important"" for the town and progress with the wall had been ""brilliant"". The project is expected to be completed by the start of 2023.

Hawkish,May's future and Johnson 'targets No 10',2024-09-25,2019-05-16,By BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-the-papers-48304282,"Many of the front pages feature stories about Theresa May's decision regarding her future as Conservative leader. The Financial Times says Mrs May has finally bowed to the inevitable by confirming her departure in June, regardless of whether she secures support for her Brexit deal. The Daily Mirror describes how she was left in tears after being forced to announce a date to finally quit. Tears welled in her eyes as she made her argument to stay in Downing Street a little longer, says the Daily Telegraph, but the sympathy and patience of senior Tories on the 1922 Committee had run out.    The Guardian says the heavy hint that Mrs May will resign if her withdrawal bill legislation is rejected once again is likely to incentivise even more Tory Eurosceptics to vote against it. The Daily Mail thinks her chances of success are slim, so a dignified exit is now probably for the best.   The Daily Telegraph believes her successor must learn from her mistakes - and take a clear pro-Leave line on Brexit and stick to it.  It suggests they make the case for what they are doing with conviction, because the country has not got the patience for another enigma.   Inevitably, much of the speculation about who replaces her focuses on Boris Johnson. The Daily Express says his supporters see him as someone who could neutralise the growing threat to the Tories posed by Nigel Farage's Brexit Party. The Daily Mail feels Mr Johnson has many flaws and divides opinion like no other politician, but acknowledges that he is charismatic.  James Forysth in the Spectator says he is not only back in contention but is now the man to beat.  The editor of the i newspaper, Oliver Duff, suggests the former foreign secretary remains the biggest obstacle to his own ambitions, lacking the judgement and work ethic to succeed in high office. The Independent's chief political commentator, John Rentoul, says that whether the new leader is Mr Johnson or the traditional surprise candidate, they will face the problem that the Tory party is finished if it fails to deliver Brexit.  The Sun believes that getting Brexit over the line, even via her deal, is still the best option.   With the opinion polls suggesting Nigel Farage's Brexit Party will make big gains in the European elections, Philip Collins in the Times argues that letting Brexit happen may be smarter than allowing Mr Farage to nurse a grievance about the failure to respect the referendum result. The main story in the Guardian tells how Iran's most prominent military leader has met Iraqi militias in Baghdad and told them to prepare for a proxy war in the Middle East.   The paper says the move to mobilise Iran's regional allies is understood to have triggered fears in the US that its interests in the area are facing a pressing threat. The Times says President Trump summoned the Swiss President to the White House on Thursday to ask him to open a communications channel with Iran amid fears that hawkish senior advisers were leading the US into an unwanted conflict with Tehran. The Guardian expresses concerns about the government's approach to the probation service after a series of failings led to the scrapping of the partial privatisation of the system. The paper is unhappy that Justice Secretary David Gauke says the 11 regions of the National Probation Service will required to buy all interventions from the market.  The Financial Times suggests the renationalisation leaves several issues unresolved, including the decision to boost the participation of voluntary groups and charities - a goal of the original reforms that was never realised. The Daily Telegraph interprets Prince Harry's successful legal action against a news agency which took aerial photographs of his home in the Cotswolds as a timely reminder that the normally non-litigious royals will act when they feel a line has been crossed. The Guardian thinks the prince's decision to apply for the terms of the settlement to be read in court lays down a marker in his fight to protect the privacy of his family. In Australia, there are many tributes to the country's former Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, who has died at the age of 89.   The front page of the Herald Sun, which has the headline ""Legend"", says he will be remembered as a great Australian - and many would say the greatest Australian of the post-war era.  The Courier Mail describes him as a true political giant, while the Age in Melbourne remembers him as Labor's golden boy who transformed a nation. For The Australian, the country's longest-serving Labor prime minister was the stuff of folklore, but his legacy was real and enormous.    Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning And the Daily Mail reports how £6,000 was spent on a new bus stop for a road in Rotherham, even though it does not have a bus route.   Residents were baffled when the structure was erected weeks after a local service was axed. Local people are now hoping the shelter will be moved to a rather more useful location - ideally one still served by a bus route."
Hawkish,Railways hit as snow disruption continues,2024-09-25,2018-03-03,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-43266514,"Rail passengers are facing continued disruption as weather warnings for snow and icy roads remain in place across much of the UK. Thousands of people remain without power and motorists have also been warned of delays on the roads. Meanwhile, the Environment Agency has 16 flood warnings in place in south-west and north-east England as temperatures are forecast to increase. Many rail lines across the UK are still blocked with widespread cancellations. Network Rail has urged people in London, the north-east of England and the East Midlands to only travel if ""absolutely necessary"". Virgin Trains East Coast has resumed services between Newcastle and Scotland but advised customers not to travel unless it was essential. Great Western Railway also advised passengers not to travel unless the journey is ""unavoidable"" while most rail companies urged people to check before travelling. National Rail has been advising passengers to check their service before travelling while many operators are running to a reduced timetable. The Met Office currently has two active yellow warnings in place, covering large areas of the UK.  One, which warns of further snow, is in place for north-east England and much of Scotland all day on Saturday. The second warning - in force until 11:00 GMT on Sunday - is for ice in south-east England, the Midlands, Wales and Northern Ireland. Another yellow warning for snow and ice has been issued for parts of north-east England and Scotland from Sunday until Monday.  Meanwhile, an independent investigation will be launched after passengers stuck on four stranded Southeastern trains in Lewisham, south London, ""forced open"" the carriage doors and walked along the tracks. The rail company has apologised to all passengers involved and offered compensation, explaining that trains ground to a halt because of power supply problems caused by ice.  But the incident sparked a warning from the British Transport Police which said people who self-evacuate are ""risking their lives"" while Southeastern said the passengers could have been electrocuted. In Scotland, government ministers have asked for volunteers to help in clearing up local roads and pavements, and checking on vulnerable people.  There will be a gradual rise in temperatures, with 7C predicted in Plymouth, but it will remain cold in the north.  Twelve flood warnings are in place in Devon, Cornwall and elsewhere on the south coast, while two are in the North East.  They all apply to coastal regions, due to large waves caused by spring tides and strong onshore winds. In Dawlish, Devon, the coastal rail line reopened after being closed on Saturday morning, due to flooding caused by high tides.  Network Rail said it has teams working to prepare areas at risk of flooding. In Holyhead in Wales, 87 boats broke their moorings as a result of the high winds caused by Storm Emma on Friday.  Meanwhile, thousands of trains are set to be cancelled in another day of travel disruption, as more than 20 rail operators are running a reduced service. Scotland is facing significant issues along its rail network after receiving the heaviest snowfall, and some of the coldest conditions, in the UK.  The West Coast Mainline to England remains closed, and Virgin Trains East Coast is not running any services north of Newcastle.  ScotRail said snow ploughs were tackling drifts as high as 10ft (3m).  Major incidents was also declared in Wiltshire, Hampshire and Avon and Somerset, as blizzards brought roads to a standstill.  On Saturday morning a lorry jack-knifed on junction 34 of the M4 in Wales, and Stagecoach suspended all its buses across the country due to the poor weather.  However, the M62 in Greater Manchester reopened in the early hours of Saturday, having been shut for more than a day due to severe weather conditions. Police rescued a couple and two dogs after they were trapped by a 12ft (3.6m) snow drift in their home in the Scottish Borders. In England, the Premier League has said all its football matches are expected to go ahead despite the weather. However, a number of games in the Championship and the Scottish Premiership have been postponed.

Hawkish,New anti-flood wall opened on storm-hit railway,2024-09-25,2020-09-25,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-54297969,"A railway line that washed into the sea in 2014 will be protected ""for generations to come"" by a new wall, Rail Minister Chris Heaton-Harris said. The minister officially opened the first section of the new structure in Dawlish, Devon, on Friday. The wall forms part of an £80m Network Rail project to safeguard the line which connects Devon and Cornwall with the rest of the rail network. Repairs to the track, damaged in storms six years ago, cost £40m. Mr Heaton-Harris said: ""Our investment in this new sea wall will provide a resilient railway for generations to come, delivering for the thousands of passengers that rely upon this vital link every day, and the residents whose homes and businesses must be protected."" The first section of the wall protects 360m of railway and homes behind it. It is 2.5m higher than the 5m wall it replaced and includes a curved top to deflect waves back towards the sea. It has been designed to preserve views and access to the coast for residents and tourists. Network Rail route director Mike Gallop said work on finishing touches was progressing well. He said the new wall ""has received lots of positive feedback from the local community and is already better protecting the railway"". Plans for the second phase will see the wall extended by 415m and accessibility improvements at Dawlish station. This work is expected to start next month and take about two years to complete. Great Western Railway interim managing director Matthew Golton said: ""It is a first stage, but it is a brilliant first stage."""
Hawkish,Why Germany isn't sending weapons to Ukraine,2024-09-25,2022-01-28,By Jenny Hill,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-60155002,"Germany's refusal to send weapons to Ukraine has puzzled and angered some allies. But the reasons why Europe's most powerful country is standing back are historical and complex. There's a great grassy plain to the east of Berlin where the soil tells terrible stories. As farmers plough, their blades disturb human bones, weapons; the fragments of one of the most brutal battles of World War Two. It was spring 1945. Hitler was hiding in a bunker in Berlin, his troops in retreat. Soviet forces advanced from the east across the plain but, above them on a hill called the Seelow Heights, the Nazis had taken up a defensive position.  It was, by all accounts, a muddy, chaotic bloodbath. The Soviets eventually prevailed, hastening the end of the war, but it's estimated up to 30,000 of their soldiers were killed. To visit the memorial at Seelow Heights is to understand how deeply entrenched this country's history remains in the minds of many Germans - and how the horrors of the 20th Century still influence its foreign policy today. It is one of the reasons Germany has refused to send weapons to Ukraine, prompting a furious response from politicians there. This is, by and large, a nation of pacifists.  An annual survey reveals that most Germans believe diplomatic negotiation is the best way to resolve conflict. German troops rarely participate in anything other than peacekeeping missions; there are few exceptions - and they were controversial - including the Balkans in the 90s and, more recently, Afghanistan. It's also, ironically, one of the world's biggest arms exporters (though its output is dwarfed by that of the US and Russia). And it has strict controls over where weapons are sent, even if Angela Merkel's government was sometimes accused of not sticking to those rules.  ""Germany has a longstanding policy of restraint when it comes to military conflict of all sorts and weapons export is seen as fuelling conflict rather than reducing conflict,"" says Thomas Kleine-Brockhoff from the German Marshall Fund. ""This longstanding policy says that Germany does not export arms into conflict zones."" Germany has departed from that principle, to arm Peshmerga fighters battling IS in Northern Iraq. But the situation in Ukraine is different, he says. The reason is history - the Nazi killings of millions of people in Ukraine and Russia. ""To export arms into the bloodlands that Germany helped to create, to supply one part of the bloodlands with arms… against the other part of the bloodlands… is an anathema in the German political debate."" The situation on the Ukrainian border is testing Germany's new coalition government. Chancellor Olaf Scholz - who probably thought Covid would be his greatest challenge - is now under pressure from his international allies to shift his country to a new, more hawkish position. His government - a coalition of Social Democrats, Greens and Free Democrats - came to power at the end of last year promising a values-based foreign policy and even stricter constraints on arms exports. Resisting calls - even from some within that government - to send weapons to Kiev, Chancellor Scholz has instead paid for a field hospital, offered to treat wounded soldiers in Germany and is sending 5,000 helmets to Ukraine. Because there's another reason for Germany's reluctance - many here simply don't believe that sending weapons will solve the crisis. Scholz's foreign minister, Green politician Annalena Baerbock, points out that Germany is a financial donor to Ukraine and believes that is more effective than sending arms. ""I do not think it's realistic to believe such weapons exports could turn around the military imbalance. The best protection is to prevent further aggression. The strongest weapon, if you want to use that word, is that we, united as Nato members, as EU states, as the G7, make clear every new aggression will have massive consequences."" Chancellor Scholz favours the dialogue-based approach pursued by his predecessor. Angela Merkel was instrumental, along with President Emmanuel Macron of France, in setting up the so-called Normandy format under which Germany, France, Ukraine and Russia aimed to establish a ceasefire in Eastern Ukraine. It's hoped that same format might work now. Nils Schmidt, foreign affairs spokesman for the chancellor's social democrats, says ""France and Germany are mediators and I think it's not very appropriate for a mediator nation to send weapons to Ukraine, to one conflict party, because we are trying to promote a diplomatic solution."" And Germany is well placed for such diplomacy. Chancellor Scholz may not have Mrs Merkel's clout with President Putin. But, thanks to their histories, Germany's relationship to Russia is unlike that of many other Western countries. Thousands of German firms do business there. Many Germans - including Angela Merkel - grew up behind the Iron Curtain, learning Russian at school. Her ability to communicate regularly with Vladimir Putin when other leaders could not, was often attributed to their shared experience of life in the Communist East. What puzzles - and angers - many around the world (and a fair few in Germany too) is why Chancellor Scholz isn't playing his most obvious card. The two countries' economic ties are perhaps most controversially embodied in the Nordstream 2 pipeline, which, if and when it comes online, would double the amount of Russian gas coming into Europe via Germany. Chancellor Scholz is under pressure to scrap the project by way of a sanction against Russia. That he has not yet done so is, critics argue, emblematic of Germany's self-interest.  It's a sore topic for his government. His social democrats, who say the pipeline is a private economic project, are behind it. But his partners, the FDP, say it's political and the Greens would dearly love to let it go.  Mr Scholz has indicated that, should Russia invade Ukraine, all options will be on the table, including the pipeline. But, in his quietly spoken way, has gone no further, prompting some to wonder whether history will judge him canny or weak and hesitant. ""It's wise to have a certain level of strategic ambiguity so that Putin cannot start calculating which price he would have to pay in case of doing this or that,"" says Nils Schmidt. ""That's why is so important to have all these options on the table."" And, in the meantime, as Vladimir Putin tests the nerves of the West, Germany faces fundamental questions about its pacifist instincts. Even towards the end of the Merkel era, calls were growing for Germany to take on a more substantial military role on the world stage. And, as visitors to Seelow Heights, who imagine the screams of Katyusha rockets and the shouts of dying men, will understand, Germany knows very well what is at stake - and the cost of getting it wrong.

Hawkish,Davidson named on Time influence list,2024-09-25,2018-04-19,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-43822459,"Scottish Conservative party leader Ruth Davidson has been named by Time magazine on its annual list of the world's most influential people. The US magazine and website says the Time 100 is not a measure of power but a recognition of individuals ""whose time is now"".  The 100 also includes world figures such as US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Other Brits include Prince Harry and London Mayor Sadiq Khan. The list is split into pioneers, leaders, titans, artists and icons. Ms Davidson is chosen as a pioneer, alongside US comedian Tiffany Haddish and snowboarder Chloe Kim. Scottish historian Niall Ferguson, a senior fellow at Stanford's Hoover Institution, writes in the magazine that the Conservative Party looked as ""dead as a dodo in Scotland"" and owes much of its resurrection to Ms Davidson's ""refreshing, rambunctious style"". The 39-year-old Edinburgh-born politician worked as a BBC journalist before entering politics in 2009.  Just two years later, she was elected the Scottish Conservatives' leader.  She has since opposed Scottish independence and Brexit as well as presiding over a revival in the fortunes of the party in Scotland. Ferguson also said Ms Davidson ""stood out"" as a proponent of same-sex marriage. A spokesman for the Scottish Conservatives said: ""Ruth's extremely honoured to be included on such a list. ""And while she's flattered to receive an accolade from across the Atlantic, her full focus remains on her job here in Scotland."" Ms Davidson is one of a record 45 people on this list under the age of 40. At just 14, British actress Millie Bobby Brown, star of Netflix drama Stranger Things, is the youngest ever to make the list. Meanwhile, former US President Barack Obama, who has said that his greatest frustration as president was the failure of commonsense gun-safety laws, nominates the Parkland, Florida, teenagers who organized the March for Our Lives."

Hawkish,World media hot-spots judge John Bolton’s legacy,2024-09-25,2019-09-11,By BBC Monitoring,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-49662600,"Media outlets in global hot-spots see the firing of hawkish US national security advisor John Bolton as a likely boost for Donald Trump's talks with US foes in Afghanistan, North Korea and other sensitive areas.  But what do the media from these countries make of John Bolton's legacy, and the way forward now? State TV channel Rossiya 1 describes Mr Bolton as a ""classic hawk of American politics"" with a hard stance on Iran, Venezuela and Russia. ""Bolton is known as the person who is ready to bomb any problem,"" its correspondent says. Russian state TV Channel One brands the outgoing national security adviser a ""hawk of hawks"", over a screen caption saying ""House of Cards"". The channel says Mr Bolton presided over the cancellation of the US-Russia Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty and ""came to predict the end"" of another arms control agreement - the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty. Its correspondent calls Mr Bolton ""the architect of this new America of Donald Trump's - an America not bound by international agreements"". Russia does not expect its ties with Washington to suddenly improve following Mr Bolton's exit, RIA news agency cites Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov as saying. Such staff reshuffles in the United States have not led to a normalisation in relations in the past, he says.  Iranian newspapers are reporting the story prominently. Arman newspaper carries the headline ""Chaos in the White House"" while Sharq daily asks ""Was Bolton sacrificed for Iran?"" One of President Hassan Rouhani's advisers said the sacking points to a failure of Washington's ""maximum pressure strategy"" against Iran.  ""The marginalisation and subsequent elimination of Bolton is not an accident but a decisive sign of the failure of the US maximum pressure strategy in the face of the constructive resistance of Iran,"" Hesameddin Ashena tweeted.  Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and Iran's envoy to the UN, Majid Takht-Ravanchi, are refusing to comment on ""America's internal matters"", according to Iranian state TV. Newspapers in Israel see Mr Bolton's departure as a blow for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Mr Bolton was Mr Netanyahu's ""most enthusiastic supporter in Washington"", says Amos Harel, defence analyst for Haaretz, calling his departure ""a significant shift in policy towards Iran"".  That's echoed by commentator Noa Landau in the same paper:  ""The sacking of US National Security Adviser John Bolton, considered especially hawkish in the Iranian issue and the last obstacle before Trump's talks with the Iranian president, is a serious blow to Netanyahu's policy on the Iranian nuclear issue - it is a nightmare Netanyahu feared in recent weeks."" For Herb Keinon in The Jerusalem Post, Mr Bolton's dismissal means Mr Netanyahu is losing a strong advocate in Trump's inner circle. But he warns that the implications go beyond the Iran issue.  ""It is no coincidence that the whole push to get US recognition of the Golan Heights began with a visit to Israel by Bolton in January, when Netanyahu made his first public appeal to the US for recognition of Israel's sovereignty over the strategic plateau. Bolton was also key in getting Trump to back away from promises to withdraw US troops from Syria, and has long been very sceptical of the reality of a two-state solution for solving the Palestinian issue."" In North Korea, state media have so far not been observed to cover the developments. But the North is likely to welcome Mr Bolton's departure, given that he has long been a target of its ire. In the past, the North's media have fiercely attacked him as ""a security-destroying adviser"", a ""warmonger,"" a ""structurally defective guy"" and a ""human defect"" that ""deserves an earlier vanishing."" But the view today from South Korea's state news agency Yonhap is that Mr Bolton's departure ""may bring flexibility to the upcoming nuclear talks with North Korea but could undercut efforts to achieve the regime's complete denuclearisation.""  Mr Bolton's removal comes as the United States and the North are expected to resume their nuclear talks later this month amid tension caused by military exercises in the South.  Venezuelan pro-government newspaper Ultimas Noticias quotes Vice-President for Economy Tareck El Aissami as saying on Twitter that Bolton was the one who ""lied the most about our people and caused them most damage"".  ""Historical truth defeated the demons of war,"" the politician tweeted.  Ultimas Noticias also notes that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said that US foreign policy towards Venezuela ""will not change, thus economic, financial and commercial blockades against the country will remain"". Venezuela's news website Tal Cual believes John Bolton ""was a key element in the US government's pressure campaign against the Nicolas Maduro's regime. His critical role was that he was considered by many officials as a spokesman for the Venezuelan opposition."" Turkey's nationalist Sozcu newspaper highlights the tension that has grown between Ankara and Washington over the purchase of Russian S-400 air defence missiles - and puts the blame on John Bolton.   ""One of the most important subjects that Trump disagreed with Bolton over was in relation to Turkey. And one of the names that led the camp that defended imposing harsh sanctions against Turkey as part of the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) was John Bolton, along with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo,"" it notes. In Lebanon, Samih Saab of the Al-Nahar newspaper declares: ""On the road between Washington and Tehran, John Bolton fell.""  He says Mr Bolton ""was the one who convinced Trump to re-impose sanctions and put the 'utmost pressure' on Iran"".   Iran is suffering from an economic war, but the regime has not fallen, he says. ""And this has presented Trump with difficult options"". BBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

Hawkish,Why did China really go cold turkey on Australian wine?,2024-09-25,2020-12-03,By Frances Mao,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-55167882,"Imagine, just for a second, the Australian wine industry as a bottle shop. For decades it had loyal customers overseas - old friends from the UK and the US partial to an antipodean drop. Then a few years ago, a new customer walked in who began eyeing up the reds. Soon, not only were they spending double the other customers, but they were buying the high-end stuff, preferring the premium vintages. China - this top customer - has bought close to 40% of Australia's wine exports in the past few years. In 2019, China bought more bottled wine from Australia than it did from France. After an intense few years of marketing and trade deals, this love affair with Australian winegrowers was fizzing along nicely. Then last week it was corked in the neck. China slapped over 200% tariffs on bottled Australian wine, in a trade hit linked to deteriorating political relations. The one swift blow exposed again Australia's economic dependence on Beijing.  Wine is just the latest Australian export this year to be collateral damage in the wider political battle. Since May, a string of goods - barley, beef, copper, sugar, lobsters, timber, coal - have been halted or otherwise sanctioned by China's Ministry of Commerce. While Beijing cites trade reasons for the blockages - accusing Australia of illegal dumping practices for its wine - analysts say it's become increasingly clear that the real motivation is political. That has spurred politicians around the world this week to release a video urging people buy Australian wine ""to stand up to China's bullying"". The #SolidarityWithAustralia campaign came from the recently formed Inter-Parliamentary Alliance of China - a group of 200 MPs from 19 countries who are known for their hawkish stances on China. The Australian senator in the video, Kimberley Kitching, argues that China has cancelled Australia's exports because of criticism on human rights. ""This isn't just an attack on Australia. This is an attack on free countries everywhere,"" she says. For local wine-growers, the overnight closure of their biggest and richest market is a devastating blow. The tariffs at minimum will triple the cost of an Australian bottle for Chinese buyers. What was once a $100 shiraz might now cost at least $300. ""Obviously people aren't rushing out to buy that,"" said Chester Osborne, a fourth-generation winemaker at the family-owned D'Arenberg Wines in South Australia's McLaren Vale. He is a mid-sized producer. The loss of China means a 20-30% cut to sales; staff cuts; and grape and bottle price reductions as product bound for China is returned home likely flooding the market. For other wine businesses - such as the 800 exporters dedicated almost exclusively to shipping Australian drops over to China - it means almost certain business closure. At a recent wine-growers meeting, Mr Osborne told the BBC, the talk was all about international politics. Most Australian exporters right now-  not just wine-growers - are closely watching the diplomatic play between Canberra and Beijing. ""It's clear as day that that's where we need to be working: how to mend the relationship [with China],"" Mr Osborne said. He contends poor diplomacy on Australia's part has led to these punishments from China. ""The word 'sorry' would be good. I don't think it's going to come out. But saying sorry would be a very, very useful way to change the direction."" Beijing's problems with Australia this year would appear to be articulated in a list circulated by its embassy in Canberra last month. It listed 14 areas where it said Canberra had aggravated relations. These included a 2018 decision to ban Huawei from its 5G tender, not recognising China's claim in contested South China Sea, and supposed ""wanton interference in Hong Kong, Xinjiang and Taiwan"". But foreign policy experts have pointed out that these have been longstanding policies of Australia's. And many - such as criticism of China's harsh new security law in Hong Kong, or the treatment of its Uighur minority - merely reflect its values as a liberal democracy. ""For a long time, Australia complained about human rights issues in China, but the trade was not affected,"" says Prof James Laurenceson from the Australia -China Relations Institute.  Political tensions began in late 2016, but the two-way trade had continued to grow. ""It's only this year the difference in values has been dragged into the trade arena.""  So what's changed this year? As China's power has grown in the region, analysts say Beijing is seeing Australia as too openly lining itself up against it. For over a decade, Australia had appeared to straddle a strategic middle ground in the Asia Pacific - benefiting off the region's competing superpowers. It found security in the US-led strategic alliance, while at the same time hitching its economic growth to exports to China. But increasingly that neutral middle ground has shrunk. Actions this year - such as Australia's call, echoing US sentiments, for a global inquiry into the coronavirus pandemic focused on China- have angered Beijing. China has also responded sharply to Australia's investigations into alleged CCP interference - claiming national security investigations are fuelled by paranoia and bias. Beijing has repeatedly accused Australia of being ""hostile"" and ""unfriendly"", and targeting it unfairly with its security laws. ""China has fundamentally lost trust that Australia is resisting aligning itself with the United States,"" says Mr Laurenceson. ""We were dealing with an accumulation of issues but that's the one really fundamental one that has been elevated this year.""  What has made the situation worse, analysts say, is poor diplomacy that at times has perhaps reflected Australia's uncertainty on where it stands. On Monday, Prime Minister Scott Morrison launched his strongest criticism yet of Beijing - demanding an apology after a Chinese government official tweeted a fake image portraying an Australian soldier killing a child. However, in the same statement he appealed to China for a relationship re-set. For two years now, Beijing has declined to answer the calls of Australian ministers in a complete breakdown of top-level diplomacy. ""Despite this terribly offensive post today, I would ask again and call on China to re-engage in that dialogue,"" Mr Morrison said on Monday. The request was later ignored by Beijing, who defended the tweet. For wine-growers like Mr Osborne, they're bunking down for the long term and hoping for a decisive, clear line to emerge soon. ""We need to decide what our rhetoric is, and how we move forward as a nation. What battles we want to pick,"" he said. ""A lot of people in China love Australian wine. I remain hopeful that this isn't going to be something that is permanent."""
Hawkish,Care homes warning of dementia funding crisis,2024-09-25,2023-06-21,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-65959804,"South West care home owners are warning many could be forced to close due to insufficient funding for people with dementia.  They said an overhaul of the system was needed to make sure elderly people have access to the right care. Figures seen by the BBC showed a disparity between council-funded places across the region. The government said it was spending up to £700m on adult social care reform over the next two years. Some Devon care home owners warned if they could not afford to take on residents whose fees are paid for by the local council, then they may only be able to accept privately-funded residents. Simon Spiller, an owner from Newton Abbot, said: ""Increasingly we are struggling to make ends meet on the government funding... this is not a real problem that's around the corner, it's here now - care homes are closing."" This is not the first warning that dementia care funding is in crisis - nor will it be the last. But we haven't compared individual council funding in the South West so explicitly before.  Many councils offer some leeway in their funding of care home placements - for example Devon and Dorset Council both make it clear that all the figures they have provided are a minimum, and they tailor funding to an individual's needs.  But ultimately every council has limited means, and its ability to raise its own funds for things like social care is dictated by national policy.   The real fear here, is that council funding for dementia placements in care homes does not match the costs that care homes are facing, and care homes in council areas that are poorly funded, are getting an even worse deal.  Some care home owners say that soon they won't be able to afford to take on council funded residents, resulting in families from the region's poorest areas having to take it on themselves. Six care homes have recently closed in Plymouth.  The BBC found the city's council paid the least for a residential placement with dementia care and a nursing placement with dementia care.  It paid £500 less than Devon County Council does for every nursing placement. Geoffrey Cox, managing director of Southern Healthcare, which owns four care Devon care homes, said: ""If we had just our Plymouth nursing home... and we were reliant on just the city council, how would the business look if it were standing purely on its own? I think it wouldn't be a very strong case to put to a bank to be honest."" A Plymouth City Council spokesperson said its funding for residential and nursing care ""had increased by 8.5% this year"" and that they work with care homes ""to adapt and develop the services to ensure they are able to meet the needs of local residents"". Council funding of care home places rose this year - at some local councils by as much as 35% - following a ""cost of care"" exercise initiated by the government.  A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""We are fully committed to our 10-year vision to reform adult social care, and recently published our Next Steps to put People at the Heart of Care plan - setting out how we are spending up to £700m on adult social care reform over the next two years."" Ian Preston whose mother is in a Dawlish care home, said: ""Mum is self-funding, so she had a certain amount of money available and we've now just sold her flat so obviously that all goes into a pot. ""I wish there was some other solution because I think it's a little bit unfair that what she has chosen to do with her money when she dies won't be available, it will all be gone into care"". Michael Harvey, whose wife is in a care home, said: ""The system is, like so many systems, broken, completely gone, shattered."" Follow BBC News South West on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

Hawkish,Kim Cattrall suggests SATC replacements,2024-09-25,2018-01-19,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-42745157,"When Kim Cattrall ruled out appearing in Sex and the City 3, saying her relationship with her co-stars was ""toxic"", it looked like there was no prospect of the film ever being made. But the actress, who played Samantha Jones, has now suggested two women who could play her part instead. She endorsed Tiffany Haddish from Girls Trip and Modern Family's Sofia Vergara.  They are among the ""many fabulous actresses to choose from that will make Samantha their own"", Cattrall said. The Liverpool-born actress played the PR executive in two films, as well as all six series of Sex and the City.  She denied that her decision to turn down the third film was due to pay or ""diva"" demands.  Her latest comments came after Sarah Jessica Parker, who starred as Carrie in the long-running comedy-drama about a group of New York friends, suggested another instalment could still happen - without Cattrall. ""You know, who knows,"" she told Ellen DeGeneres on her talk show. ""Perhaps, we'll find a way. Right now I don't know."" She also suggested DeGeneres herself could take the role of Samantha - to which Cattrall replied on Twitter with two thumbs up emojis, saying: ""She'd be fabulous."" Cattrall went on to say that fellow talk show host Oprah Winfrey was her first love and she'd also enjoy seeing ""goddesses"" Haddish or Vergara play the part.

Hawkish,Link road approved as part of housing scheme,2024-09-25,2022-10-13,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-63239867,"A new link road will be built in Devon as part of a scheme for 860 homes. Devon County Council's ruling cabinet unanimously approved the project on the edge of Dawlish on Wednesday. Located between Elm Grove Road and the A379 Exeter Road, it forms part of Teignbridge District Council's local plan to build the houses near Secmaton Lane. The road is expected to cost about £6.2m, with £4.9m coming from the government. In addition to the money from the Housing Infrastructure Fund, the remaining £1.3m is expected to come from developer contributions, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said. Councillors previously heard how the lack of a link road during the construction of other homes nearby had caused ""many issues"" in Dawlish, as works vehicles had to rely on Elm Grove Road which runs through the heart of the town. Councillors heard the link road would also have cycle lanes and footpaths. The plan for ""at least 860 homes"" on land to the north-west of Dawlish was mentioned in the local plan (2013- 2033), with a target of 25% affordable homes, along with a range of social and community facilities. Speaking at the cabinet meeting, local councillor Martin Wrigley (Lib Dem), said: ""This road has been seven years, at least, in the making... and it will be a massive relief when it comes in to the local residents"".

Hawkish,The team Trump is taking to Singapore,2024-09-25,2018-06-07,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-44378360,"A US team of negotiators has been talking to counterparts in North Korea ahead of the showdown talks between the two leaders in Singapore. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has played a leading role in a number of working sessions that concluded on Monday.  Their aim was to hammer out the vital questions and areas to discuss later. The Washington Post reports that the two leaders will meet one-on-one before the teams of experts join them. As well as Mr Pompeo, Chief of Staff John Kelly and National Security Adviser John Bolton are expected to be there - he has already infuriated the North Koreans with his tough line. So who else will there be on the US side? Korean-American Andrew Kim is the head of the CIA's Korea Mission Centre. Mr Kim was born and raised in South Korea under the name Kim Sung-hyun, the Washington Post reported. He attended the prestigious Seoul High School, which boasts South Korea's national security adviser and intelligence agency head as alumni, before moving to the US during college. He worked with the CIA for the majority of his career, serving in Moscow, Beijing, Bangkok and Seoul.  Mr Kim had retired, but the CIA brought him back to lead the new Korea Mission Centre last May. In the lead up to the summit, he seems to have become Mr Pompeo's right-hand-man for all things North Korea related - including planning strikes, a South Korean presidential adviser said. He has been described by South Korean and Japanese media as a ""messenger from hell"" due to his hawkish stance on North Korea. Veteran diplomat Sung Kim is the current US ambassador to the Philippines.  He served as the ambassador to South Korea between 2011-2014 and was a US special envoy in the Six-Party talks.  Mr Kim was born in Seoul but grew up in Los Angeles. As a diplomat, he served in Tokyo, Kuala Lumpur and Hong Kong.  During his time in Washington, he was the special representative for North Korea policy in Washington, director of the Office of Korean Affairs and Staff Assistant in the Bureau of East Asia and Pacific Affairs. He recently led the US delegation to meet North Korean officials at the border to discuss talks, Reuters reported. A South Korean official told Reuters Mr Kim was ""capable, level-headed, cautious"", with a ""solid grasp of the issues and [he] knows North Koreans well"". A top aide to Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, he has been instrumental in laying the groundwork for the upcoming summits, according to the White House. The former Navy intelligence officer and State Department diplomat now serves as Assistant Secretary of Defense for Asian and Pacific Security Affairs, and has been holding talks with North Korean delegates at the DMZ for weeks. In June he travelled to Pyongyang with Mr Pompeo. From 1994-98 he worked for the Pentagon on day-to-day relations with the Chinese military and bilateral relations with Taiwan. He previously served as president and CEO of Project 2049, a think tank specialising in Asian security issues. The native of the US state of Oregon has run in four triathlons, according to Armitage International consulting firm, which he co-founded. She is a Korean peninsula specialist on the White House National Security Council, which she joined in 2014 under former President Barack Obama.  She was formerly a member of the Department of State Bureau of Intelligence and Research where she was tasked with North Korean nuclear policy. In 2017, she was chosen by the White House to be part of the US delegation to the closing ceremony of the Olympic games in PyeongChang. However, she reportedly did not meet with any North Korean officials during her time there.  In 2014, under President Obama, she travelled to North Korea with then-director of National Intelligence James Clapper to negotiate the release of two American detainees. During the brief trip, she also met powerful Korean General Kim Yong-chol. The wild card on the US delegation is the US president's own daughter, and White House adviser, who led the US delegation to the 2018 Winter Olympics. The games, which were attended by North Korea, paved the way for these peace talks. During her time there, she sat in the stands beside the North Korean leader's sister, Kim Yo Jong. At one point the two women shook hands as cameras documented the moment. The absence of US First Lady Melania Trump from Singapore has only added to the speculation that Ms Trump may make a surprise appearance."
Hawkish,Dawlish underpass shut for railway sea wall work,2024-09-25,2022-06-13,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-61786123,"An underpass in a Devon town has been closed for work on a sea wall to protect a railway line from storms and rising sea levels, engineers have said. The Colonnade underpass in Dawlish was being shut for up to 12 weeks to build foundations for a new bridge, Network Rail said. Access to the beach and promenade would be limited over the summer. Bosses said it was also part of the final phase of construction of a sea wall which would protect the town too. Network Rail said safety was its priority and the closure was needed because engineers would be operating large and heavy machinery to install 66ft (20m) long foundations.  It added ""every effort will be made to complete this work sooner"". Rob Breckon, of the rail track operator, said it was realised ""there was no good time"" to do work, particularly during the summer. But he added that delaying it until after summer was not possible due to the extreme weather the local coastline could experience.  The new bridge will connect the two sections of a new accessible public promenade and house a culvert to allow the Dawlish Water stream to flow into the sea, managers said. The work is being carried out after the track was washed away by the sea when it was hit by huge waves. Most of Devon and Cornwall was without a railway line to the rest of the country for several weeks after the storm between 4 and 5 February 2014. Network Rail said the entire £80m line protection scheme was due to be completed in 2023 and would protect the railway for 100 years. Follow BBC News South West on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

Hawkish,Obituary: Donald Rumsfeld,2024-09-25,2021-06-30,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-54889848,"Donald Rumsfeld, who served as secretary of defence for President Gerald Ford and President George W Bush, has died aged 88. Best known for overseeing the US response to the 9/11 terror attacks, his political career eventually came undone by the spiralling conflict in Iraq.  Across a career spanning decades, Rumsfeld forged a reputation as the ultimate Washington insider and a true political survivor notorious for outmanoeuvring his foes. But to his critics he was hawkish and ruthless - a Machiavellian figure and an architect of war. One of his most memorable moments came at a 2002 news briefing when - asked about the lack of evidence linking Saddam Hussein to weapons of mass destruction - he gave a meandering answer about the concept of ""known knowns"" and ""known unknowns"" to much public mockery.  Donald Henry Rumsfeld was born in Chicago on 9 July 1932. His father, a real estate salesman, was enlisted in the Navy during WW2. In childhood, Rumsfeld was an Eagle Scout who went on to find a love of wrestling. After studying political science at Princeton University on a naval scholarship, he followed in his father's footsteps to enlist and served as an aviator and flight instructor between 1954 and 1957. After transferring to the reserves, he came to Washington DC first as an assistant to a congressman before being elected himself to the US House of Representatives for Illinois in 1962. Rumsfeld resigned his post in 1969 to direct Richard Nixon's Office of Economic Opportunity, before serving in several other positions in the administration including as US ambassador to Nato from 1973-74. After Nixon's resignation over the Watergate scandal, Rumsfeld was named first as Gerald Ford's transition chairman then as his chief of staff.  He was then appointed Secretary of Defence in a 1975 cabinet reshuffle and, aged 43, became the youngest to hold the post. Serving at a time when US policy was still dominated by Cold War anxiety, Rumsfeld oversaw the development of the Trident nuclear submarine and ""peacekeeper"" MX intercontinental ballistic missile programmes. He also famously undermined Henry Kissinger's work on Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT II) with the Soviets during this time. After Ford lost out to Jimmy Carter and left office in 1977, Rumsfeld moved into the private sector while maintaining some part-time federal commitments and roles on the side - including, at one point, serving as special envoy to the Middle East for President Ronald Reagan.  He spent almost a decade in senior management of pharmaceutical firm GD Searle & Co and served as CEO and chairman at electronics manufacturer General Instrument before returning to pharmaceuticals as chairman of Gilead Sciences.  Never far away from politics, he was chosen to head up a bipartisan commission to assess the ballistic missile threat to the United States in 1998. The probe was ignited by sharp criticism of intelligence assessments under the Clinton administration which played down the security risk to continental North America following the collapse of the Soviet Union. The Rumsfeld Report, as the findings came to be known, argued that the US faced a growing threat from overtly or potentially hostile nations including North Korea, Iraq and Iran. It suggested that these states could potentially inflict ""major destruction"" on the US within five years of deciding to pursue a missile capability - far shorter than the 15 years predicted by intelligence estimates. The findings revived intense debate over the nation's missile defence systems and defence policy.  After the knife-edge 2000 election, Rumsfeld was nominated to serve again as defence secretary under George W Bush. Once the youngest to take the post, he became - at the time - the oldest. A veteran welcomed by party conservatives, Rumsfeld had already served as an adviser to Bush's campaign on foreign policy. Bush described his appointee as a man of ""great judgement"" with a ""strong vision"". In the president's cabinet, Rumsfeld found strong personalities in Colin Powell as Secretary of State and Vice-President Dick Cheney - who had succeeded him as Ford's chief of staff back in the 1970s. A priority for the Bush administration had been readying the Pentagon to deal with new and evolving security threats - with Rumsfeld put in charge of the attempt to revamp and streamline a military seen as resistant to change.  His frank approach to reassert civilian control was widely reported to have offended military top brass in the early days of the administration.  But then, less than nine months into the presidency, the US came under unprecedented attack.  Rumsfeld had been holding a Pentagon breakfast meeting with congressmen to try and garner support for missile defence when the World Trade Center was targeted on the morning of 11 September 2001. Insisting on continuing with his daily briefings, Rumsfeld was still inside when the defence headquarters itself was hit with another hijacked aircraft.  He would later recall feeling the building shake and running toward the crash site - leading to a scramble as officials struggled to locate him. ""Outside I found fresh air and a chaotic scene,"" he wrote. ""For the first time I could see the clouds of black smoke rising from the west side of the building. I ran along the Pentagon's perimeter, and then saw the flames."" Video footage aired on CNN showed Rumsfeld helping to stretcher someone to safety before going back inside to help co-ordinate the nation's response. Evidence would later emerge in declassified notes that within hours of the attack, Rumsfeld was already floating the idea of retaliatory strikes on not just Osama Bin Laden - the main suspect - but on Saddam Hussein's Iraq too.  The initial response was to foreshadow what was to come.  On 7 October, less than a month after the attack, US forces began an air campaign against al-Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan. A swift ground campaign followed, improving Rumsfeld's reputation as he provided regular updates at briefings.  But by 2002, the Bush administration's attention had turned to Iraq. The president singled out the country - along with Iran and North Korea - as part of what he dubbed the ""axis of evil"" whom he said threatened the peace of the world by pursuing weapons of mass destruction.  It was just weeks after that State of the Union address when Rumsfeld was asked about the lack of evidence at a Pentagon briefing and responded with his famous ""known and unknowns"" retort. The concept was not invented by Rumsfeld - but the response nonetheless brought widespread ridicule at the time given the controversy over the Bush administration's stance and push for war. After giving up on getting a resolution authorising the use of force passed at the UN, the US and UK pressed ahead with plans to invade alone. Operation Iraqi Freedom began in March 2003 despite continued questions over their evidence and rationale.  Rumsfeld, one of the most hawkish in the cabinet, was seen as a key architect of the conflict. That year he predicted in a memo the wars would be a ""a long, hard slog"" - something history proved as painfully true, with US troops still embroiled in exiting the conflicts almost two decades on.  The defence head was never far away from news headlines and blunders. Rumsfeld's time in office was dogged by criticism over his handling of the conflicts and he built a reputation for his candid and controversial off-the-cuff remarks.  But Bush stood resolute by him, even in the wake of the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse scandal - where photographs of US troops posing next to Iraqi prisoners in humiliating poses were leaked.  By then it was clear that despite the fear and rhetoric - Iraq had no stockpiles of biological, chemical or nuclear weapons prior to the invasion. And as insurgency and violence spiralled, so did questions over Rumsfeld's leadership and he found himself under mounting pressure to quit. Rumsfeld said he offered to resign twice over Abu Ghraib, but the president continued to back him and even asked him to stay on in the post after he won re-election in November 2004.  It took two more years, and bruising losses for the Republicans in the 2006 mid-term elections, for Bush to finally acknowledge a ""fresh perspective"" on the conflict was needed. By this time Rumsfeld had weathered public criticism over equipment from members of the military themselves and even an admission he had used a machine to sign signatures on the condolence letters to the families of dead soldiers. The president remained complimentary of his outgoing pick's work and legacy. But his own father, George Bush Senior, was not as positive - later describing Rumsfeld as ""an arrogant fellow"" who he believed had hurt his son's presidency. In his 2011 memoir, Rumsfeld remained largely defiant over the war's handling - though he did express regret over some of his comments and conceded the US could have sent more troops into Iraq. In 2013 he was the subject of The Unknown Known - a documentary by Academy Award winning director Errol Morris.  The filmmaker set out to delve inside Rumsfeld's mind like he had with former Secretary of Defence Robert S McNamara in The Fog of War, but later conceded that after 33 hours of interviews with the enigmatic Rumsfeld, he seemed to know even less about the origins of the Iraq war than when he started the project.  He compared meeting Donald Rumsfeld to Alice in Wonderland's perplexing encounter with the Cheshire Cat in the Lewis Carroll classic.  ""I was left with the frightening suspicion that the grin might not be hiding anything,"" he wrote in the New York Times. ""It was a grin of supreme self-satisfaction and behind the grin might be nothing at all."""

Hawkish,N Korea new missile test: A game-changer?,2024-09-25,2017-07-05,By Dr John Nilsson-Wright,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-40502031,"North Korea's confident announcement that it has successfully launched an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capable of striking the US is another iteration in the high stakes game of international poker that Pyongyang appears to excel at.  Carefully timed to coincide with the 4 July holidays in the US, Kim Jong-un's triumphal blast has simultaneously allowed the North Korean authoritarian leader to make good on his promises of military modernisation to his own people while exposing the hollow overconfident tweets of President Donald Trump that an ICBM launch ""won't happen"". The launch of the North's Hwasong-14 rocket is in practical terms merely an incremental step forward from an earlier launch in May, when a similar rocket flew for 30 minutes, to a height of some 1,312 miles (2,111km) over a distance of some 489 miles.  The most recent missile added seven to nine minutes of flight time, an extra 400 miles or so in height and a further 88 miles in overall distance. Superficially this is simply more of the same pattern of provocation and tactical sabre-rattling that the North has been pursuing for decades, whether through its longstanding quest to acquire nuclear weapons (dating from the 1960s) or its missile testing programme, sharply accelerated in the course of last year.  Yet, by bringing Alaska within range, the new test is an unambiguous game-changer in both symbolical and practical terms.  US territory (albeit separate from the contiguous continental US) is now finally within Pyongyang's cross-hairs and for the first time a US president has to accept that the North poses a ""real and present"" danger not merely to north-east Asia and America's key allies - but to the US proper. President Trump's weakness lies in having overplayed his hand too publicly and too loudly.   His initial gambit of deploying a US ""armada"" to the region in the form of the USS Carl Vinson battle group, not only involved a poor use of historical analogies (the ill-fated 16th Century Spanish fleet was probably the least auspicious of reference points), but also signally failed to intimidate the North Koreans.  Similarly, openly pressuring the Chinese to impose punitive sanctions on North Korea in return for economic restraint from the US through a Trumpian concession not to list Beijing as a currency manipulator also appears to have failed.  President Xi, notwithstanding the positive mood music of the April Mar-a-Lago summit, appears to have avoided being boxed in by Trump, and China's reaction to the North's latest provocation is likely to be limited to a familiar pattern of rhetorical condemnation and a call for calm from all parties.  Washington's immediate options are limited.  Military action - notwithstanding the hawkish recommendations of Republican senators such as John McCain and Lindsay Graham - is next to impossible given the risks involved to Seoul and the poor prospects of success, either in terms of removing the North's strategic assets or its political leadership.  Sanctions are likely to be revisited, through a reconvening of the UN Security Council, but the political process is slow and enforcement is at best a partial and therefore ineffectual approach.  Talks are one way forward and the convergence of views between Washington and Seoul on the back of President Moon's recent visit to the US suggest that some sort of partial re-engagement with the North might be on the cards, albeit within a framework of reinforced deterrence.  Yet, for now the momentum is all with Pyongyang, which has little incentive to sit down with the US and can afford to play for time in accelerating its military modernisation efforts while capitalising on divisions within the international community.  While the US, South Korean and Japanese leaders will be united in pushing for tough measures at this week's G20 summit in Germany, they will be hard pressed to secure the support of either China or Russia for anything beyond a bland, condemnatory declaration. The dangers of the present crisis are two-fold.  A more confident Kim Jong-un, emboldened by his latest success may become less risk-averse, engaging in conventional military brinkmanship which, while not going as far as pre-emptive attacks on his neighbours, might spill over into conflict through miscalculation rather than through design.   Alternatively, the US confronted by the unpalatable reality of seeing the North cross yet another supposedly non-negotiable ""red line"" may simply choose to avert its eyes.  For a president wedded to his own version of ""fake news"", the easiest way to cope with an inconvenient truth may be to redefine or simply ignore the original ""red line"".  This would be a major mistake since it will do nothing to deter the North while encouraging other states in the region to pursue their own military modernisation plans, storing up even greater problems for the future.  Ultimately, Mr Trump, if he wishes to demonstrate that he is indeed master of the ""art of the deal"", will need to give up the bully pulpit of megaphone diplomacy via twitter and pivot towards a more enlightened approach.  This could involve the imaginative despatch of a high-profile US senior statesman to negotiate with and appeal to the ego and amour propre of the young North Korean leader. It could also involve closer co-ordination with America's allies, most notably South Korea, in offering some high-profile political concessions to the North - whether the establishment of a US liaison mission in Pyongyang or a sequenced pattern of asymmetric conventional force reductions on the peninsula.  Right now, Washington (for the sake of the region and the wider world) urgently needs a long-term, sustained and calibrated strategy for dealing with the North that is more than a reactive game of eye-ball to eye-ball posturing.  An impulsive, attention deficient and hyper-active President Trump would be better advised to switch from playing poker to chess.

Hawkish,Care homes warning of dementia funding crisis,2024-09-25,2023-06-21,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-65959804,"South West care home owners are warning many could be forced to close due to insufficient funding for people with dementia.  They said an overhaul of the system was needed to make sure elderly people have access to the right care. Figures seen by the BBC showed a disparity between council-funded places across the region. The government said it was spending up to £700m on adult social care reform over the next two years. Some Devon care home owners warned if they could not afford to take on residents whose fees are paid for by the local council, then they may only be able to accept privately-funded residents. Simon Spiller, an owner from Newton Abbot, said: ""Increasingly we are struggling to make ends meet on the government funding... this is not a real problem that's around the corner, it's here now - care homes are closing."" This is not the first warning that dementia care funding is in crisis - nor will it be the last. But we haven't compared individual council funding in the South West so explicitly before.

Some care home owners say that soon they won't be able to afford to take on council funded residents, resulting in families from the region's poorest areas having to take it on themselves. Six care homes have recently closed in Plymouth.  The BBC found the city's council paid the least for a residential placement with dementia care and a nursing placement with dementia care.  It paid £500 less than Devon County Council does for every nursing placement. Geoffrey Cox, managing director of Southern Healthcare, which owns four care Devon care homes, said: ""If we had just our Plymouth nursing home... and we were reliant on just the city council, how would the business look if it were standing purely on its own? I think it wouldn't be a very strong case to put to a bank to be honest."" A Plymouth City Council spokesperson said its funding for residential and nursing care ""had increased by 8.5% this year"" and that they work with care homes ""to adapt and develop the services to ensure they are able to meet the needs of local residents"". Council funding of care home places rose this year - at some local councils by as much as 35% - following a ""cost of care"" exercise initiated by the government.  A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""We are fully committed to our 10-year vision to reform adult social care, and recently published our Next Steps to put People at the Heart of Care plan - setting out how we are spending up to £700m on adult social care reform over the next two years.""

He added that it was ""fantastic"", but also paid tribute to his teams ""on and off the pitch"". He has been described by the club as the ""driving force behind the Chiefs for over 20 years"" who had helped with sponsorship and ""guide them from the National Leagues to that of Premiership champions"". The Chiefs won the Premiership in 2017 and 2020, and were also European Champions Cup winners in 2020. He said: ""It's really fantastic.  ""I found out by email and did a double-check to see if it was a scam, but it was genuine."" He added: ""I couldn't have done what I have done without the teams I've got round me; the team on the pitch or the team off the pitch. They enable me to do the work I do.""

Hawkish,Exe protection zones proving a success for birds,2024-09-25,2023-09-12,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-66773324,"Two wildlife protection zones in the Exe Estuary are proving to be a success, five years after they were introduced, say bird experts. The seasonal refuge zone near Exmouth operates between September and December, while the zone at Dawlish Warren operates year round. During these times, water-users are asked to avoid entering the areas. Wildlife experts say the zones are helping to protect birds using the estuary to feed and roost. ""Despite some major ups and downs in certain species over the last 50 years, the total number of waterbirds on the Exe has remained remarkably stable, with wintering numbers of waders and wildfowl consistently around 15,000 birds,"" said David Price, a volunteer with the British Trust for Ornithology. ""The two refuge areas at Exmouth and Dawlish Warren make a significant contribution to supporting this number of birds.  ""The sand spits and beach areas at Dawlish Warren offer safe roosting sites at high tide for wading birds to rest on whilst their feeding areas are covered. ""Protection for these two areas is therefore an important element of conserving a significant proportion of the Exe Estuary's birdlife,"" he said. The wildlife refuges have been operating since 2018 and are marked with yellow buoys. Councillor Emma Morse, chair of South East Devon Habitat Regulations Executive Committee, said: ""The birds are easily disturbed by people, dogs and all kinds of water-users, so by avoiding the wildlife refuges you are playing an important role in helping them to survive after their long flights.""

The Havana singer wrote to her past self: ""You're not gonna believe this [small] Camila but in 2018 Madonna is going to give you an award for video of the year and your acne will clear."" Six years ago, she'd tweeted she wanted to be at the VMAs ""so bad"". The 21-year-old won video of the year and artist of the year. Camila dedicated her award for artist of the year to her fans. She said: ""I'm fully aware that you never know when you're going to get a moment like this again and you never know when it's going to be the last time on this stage but the relationship I have with you guys, with my fans, is a forever thing."" She also took the opportunity to praise the other women that were nominated. ""I wanna say it's incredible, I'm so honoured to be in a category with such incredible nominees, especially the female nominees that are in the category this year, Cardi B, Ariana, Nicki (Minaj)."" It was Madonna who presented Camila with the award for video of the year. After accepting the award for Havana, the singer got down on her knees to worship Madonna. She described it as a ""surreal moment"".  ""I wanna thank my family who inspired this music video,"" she said. ""I wanna thank my fans again and honestly, I dedicate this to Madonna."" Despite her success this year, it's not the first time Camila has won something at the VMAs. In 2014, her former band Fifth Harmony were awarded Artist to Watch for Miss Movin' On.  Camila Cabello left the group in December 2016 and the remaining four members decided to take a break in March 2018 to focus on their solo careers. Comedian Tiffany Haddish, who was one of the presenters, took the opportunity to take a swipe at the girl group. Whilst on stage talking about Camila she said: ""So those of you watching at home, hi Fifth Harmony."" She then waved to the group down the camera as they weren't at the awards.  Shortly after, Nicki Minaj came on stage to collect her award for best hip-hop and she didn't appear happy.  ""Don't be coming for Fifth Harmony,"" she told Tiffany.

Hawkish,Main roads closed as storm brings flooding,2024-09-25,2021-01-21,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-shropshire-55747567,"A number of major roads in Shropshire were closed after heavy flooding caused by Storm Christoph. There were 11 flood warnings in place across the county, including eight on the River Severn. Roads closed included parts of the A5, A41, A49 and A483 with one emergency service worker reporting ""the worst driving conditions I have ever experienced"". In the North West and parts of Wales, people were evacuated from their homes. In Woore, seven miles from Market Drayton, Peter Gill and his wife Marie had to be rescued along with their dog from a farm house on Wednesday night when it became surrounded by flood waters up to 3ft (0.9m) deep. ""[I'm] Devastated because we've spent a lot of money on this house and we just feel as though we're sort of abandoned really and we don't know quite what to do,"" he said. Mr Gill added that the water was ""coming like a river"" down the road and on to the drive.  Coupled with a small brook on the property, he said the flood water quickly overwhelmed a culvert.                                        ""Within half an hour we had probably looking at the house 18 inches of water totally around the house.""  There have been more than 160 flood warnings in place across England, including about 40 in the West Midlands region, as well as a Met Office yellow warning for ice. Shropshire Council said on Thursday afternoon that river levels would continue to rise overnight, with a peak of between 4.4m (14.4ft) and 4.8m (15.7ft) at the Welsh Bridge in Shrewsbury. Floodwater blocked an entrance to a Covid-19 vaccination hub at The Robert Jones and Agnes Hunt Orthopaedic Hospital in Gobowen in the morning. Shropshire firefighters have dealt with more than 70 calls. Emergency services were called out to a number of people stranded in their cars on flooded roads near Hadnall and Oswestry. A number of villages along the Severn have also been affected, including Montford Bridge. Frankwell Riverside, Frankwell Main and St Julian's Friar's car parks in Shrewsbury were closed. Flood defences have been deployed in Shrewsbury and Ironbridge, although the Environment Agency said river levels were not expected to reach those of last year. Police advised people to avoid travelling unless their journey was ""really necessary"" saying some roads were ""impassable"". As river levels rise, emergency services have reminded people that under lockdown rules, residents should leave their property if they are in danger. Shropshire Fire and Rescue Service group commander Russ Hales said: ""There's plans in place and you'll be held in reception areas or in suitable accommodation that will be deemed as being Covid safe or Covid appropriate.""

The charity had nine vehicles which took 2,000 registered passengers from the community on essential journeys, wellbeing trips and medical appointments in south Devon. ""We really are their lifeline, taking them to get their shopping, to the banks, post office, buying presents for their family members - so keeping people independent,"" Ms Preston said. She praised the police and fire service for their investigations and support and said the response from the community had been ""overwhelming"".

Hawkish,Why did China really go cold turkey on Australian wine?,2024-09-25,2020-12-03,By Frances Mao,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-55167882,"Imagine, just for a second, the Australian wine industry as a bottle shop. For decades it had loyal customers overseas - old friends from the UK and the US partial to an antipodean drop. Then a few years ago, a new customer walked in who began eyeing up the reds. Soon, not only were they spending double the other customers, but they were buying the high-end stuff, preferring the premium vintages. China - this top customer - has bought close to 40% of Australia's wine exports in the past few years. In 2019, China bought more bottled wine from Australia than it did from France. After an intense few years of marketing and trade deals, this love affair with Australian winegrowers was fizzing along nicely. Then last week it was corked in the neck. China slapped over 200% tariffs on bottled Australian wine, in a trade hit linked to deteriorating political relations. The one swift blow exposed again Australia's economic dependence on Beijing.  Wine is just the latest Australian export this year to be collateral damage in the wider political battle. Since May, a string of goods - barley, beef, copper, sugar, lobsters, timber, coal - have been halted or otherwise sanctioned by China's Ministry of Commerce. While Beijing cites trade reasons for the blockages - accusing Australia of illegal dumping practices for its wine - analysts say it's become increasingly clear that the real motivation is political. That has spurred politicians around the world this week to release a video urging people buy Australian wine ""to stand up to China's bullying"". The #SolidarityWithAustralia campaign came from the recently formed Inter-Parliamentary Alliance of China - a group of 200 MPs from 19 countries who are known for their hawkish stances on China. The Australian senator in the video, Kimberley Kitching, argues that China has cancelled Australia's exports because of criticism on human rights. ""This isn't just an attack on Australia. This is an attack on free countries everywhere,"" she says. For local wine-growers, the overnight closure of their biggest and richest market is a devastating blow. The tariffs at minimum will triple the cost of an Australian bottle for Chinese buyers. What was once a $100 shiraz might now cost at least $300. ""Obviously people aren't rushing out to buy that,"" said Chester Osborne, a fourth-generation winemaker at the family-owned D'Arenberg Wines in South Australia's McLaren Vale. He is a mid-sized producer. The loss of China means a 20-30% cut to sales; staff cuts; and grape and bottle price reductions as product bound for China is returned home likely flooding the market. For other wine businesses - such as the 800 exporters dedicated almost exclusively to shipping Australian drops over to China - it means almost certain business closure. At a recent wine-growers meeting, Mr Osborne told the BBC, the talk was all about international politics. Most Australian exporters right now-  not just wine-growers - are closely watching the diplomatic play between Canberra and Beijing. ""It's clear as day that that's where we need to be working: how to mend the relationship [with China],"" Mr Osborne said. He contends poor diplomacy on Australia's part has led to these punishments from China. ""The word 'sorry' would be good. I don't think it's going to come out. But saying sorry would be a very, very useful way to change the direction."" Beijing's problems with Australia this year would appear to be articulated in a list circulated by its embassy in Canberra last month. It listed 14 areas where it said Canberra had aggravated relations. These included a 2018 decision to ban Huawei from its 5G tender, not recognising China's claim in contested South China Sea, and supposed ""wanton interference in Hong Kong, Xinjiang and Taiwan"". But foreign policy experts have pointed out that these have been longstanding policies of Australia's. And many - such as criticism of China's harsh new security law in Hong Kong, or the treatment of its Uighur minority - merely reflect its values as a liberal democracy. ""For a long time, Australia complained about human rights issues in China, but the trade was not affected,"" says Prof James Laurenceson from the Australia -China Relations Institute.  Political tensions began in late 2016, but the two-way trade had continued to grow. ""It's only this year the difference in values has been dragged into the trade arena.""  So what's changed this year? As China's power has grown in the region, analysts say Beijing is seeing Australia as too openly lining itself up against it. For over a decade, Australia had appeared to straddle a strategic middle ground in the Asia Pacific - benefiting off the region's competing superpowers. It found security in the US-led strategic alliance, while at the same time hitching its economic growth to exports to China. But increasingly that neutral middle ground has shrunk. Actions this year - such as Australia's call, echoing US sentiments, for a global inquiry into the coronavirus pandemic focused on China- have angered Beijing. China has also responded sharply to Australia's investigations into alleged CCP interference - claiming national security investigations are fuelled by paranoia and bias. Beijing has repeatedly accused Australia of being ""hostile"" and ""unfriendly"", and targeting it unfairly with its security laws. ""China has fundamentally lost trust that Australia is resisting aligning itself with the United States,"" says Mr Laurenceson. ""We were dealing with an accumulation of issues but that's the one really fundamental one that has been elevated this year.""  What has made the situation worse, analysts say, is poor diplomacy that at times has perhaps reflected Australia's uncertainty on where it stands. On Monday, Prime Minister Scott Morrison launched his strongest criticism yet of Beijing - demanding an apology after a Chinese government official tweeted a fake image portraying an Australian soldier killing a child. However, in the same statement he appealed to China for a relationship re-set. For two years now, Beijing has declined to answer the calls of Australian ministers in a complete breakdown of top-level diplomacy. ""Despite this terribly offensive post today, I would ask again and call on China to re-engage in that dialogue,"" Mr Morrison said on Monday. The request was later ignored by Beijing, who defended the tweet. For wine-growers like Mr Osborne, they're bunking down for the long term and hoping for a decisive, clear line to emerge soon. ""We need to decide what our rhetoric is, and how we move forward as a nation. What battles we want to pick,"" he said. ""A lot of people in China love Australian wine. I remain hopeful that this isn't going to be something that is permanent."""

The rod-jointed toys named the Roosevelt Bears had been owned by one family since 1904, but ""not played with much"".  Auctioneers in Gloucestershire had to X-ray them to check their rare joints. The bears were sold with an original copy of Seymour Eaton's storybook, the Roosevelt Bears, from where they got their names. Auctioneers Dominic Winter said rod bears were rare and having a well-preserved pair at auction was ""an exceptional occurrence"". Susanna Winters, toys and games specialist at the auction house, said: ""The only way to prove they were rod bears was to get them X-rayed.  ""I arrived at the vets with a bag of teddies and explained what we wanted... the vet staff were as jubilant as I was when the X-ray confirmed our hopes."" Teddy B and Teddy G, as they are known, were originally bought in the United States. The anonymous seller remembered ""not being allowed to handle them as a child"" and said for some years the bears ""had been confined to an old trunk"", the auction house said. Auctioneer Chris Albury said the bears were bought by a woman in Florida who was an online bidder ""so they'll be returning to the States after a sojourn in the UK"". The bears had been estimated to sell for £10,000."
Hawkish,New anti-flood wall opened on storm-hit railway,2024-09-25,2020-09-25,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-54297969,"A railway line that washed into the sea in 2014 will be protected ""for generations to come"" by a new wall, Rail Minister Chris Heaton-Harris said. The minister officially opened the first section of the new structure in Dawlish, Devon, on Friday. The wall forms part of an £80m Network Rail project to safeguard the line which connects Devon and Cornwall with the rest of the rail network. Repairs to the track, damaged in storms six years ago, cost £40m. Mr Heaton-Harris said: ""Our investment in this new sea wall will provide a resilient railway for generations to come, delivering for the thousands of passengers that rely upon this vital link every day, and the residents whose homes and businesses must be protected."" The first section of the wall protects 360m of railway and homes behind it. It is 2.5m higher than the 5m wall it replaced and includes a curved top to deflect waves back towards the sea. It has been designed to preserve views and access to the coast for residents and tourists. Network Rail route director Mike Gallop said work on finishing touches was progressing well. He said the new wall ""has received lots of positive feedback from the local community and is already better protecting the railway"". Plans for the second phase will see the wall extended by 415m and accessibility improvements at Dawlish station. This work is expected to start next month and take about two years to complete. Great Western Railway interim managing director Matthew Golton said: ""It is a first stage, but it is a brilliant first stage."""
Hawkish,Planned hospital closure could face second review,2024-09-25,2023-03-22,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-65037473,"Another review into the planned closure of a community hospital in Devon is a step closer. Teignmouth Hospital, the first to be built by the NHS, is due to close, with services moving to a new £8m health centre in the town and to Dawlish Hospital  The closure of the hospital in Mill Lane, opened in 1954, is part of a NHS plan to modernise services in the area. Devon's health scrutiny committee is to investigate the possible impacts, It will then decide whether to refer the proposals back to the health secretary for a second time, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. It did so in 2021, unhappy with a lack of consultation over the hospital's future, but then health secretary Sajid Javid asked for a review by a panel of independent experts, who decided the NHS Devon Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) consultation had been ""adequate,"" However, the panel identified ""lessons to be learned for both parties,"" adding the NHS must engage with the community to ""determine the future"" of the hospital. A campaign to save it has continued, and Teignbridge District Council last month agreed to write to current health secretary Steve Barclay to review the closure again. Councillors claim there is much more pressure on the health system since the original decision, made pre-pandemic, while the League of Friends of Teignmouth Hospital has pledged £1m to refurbish it as a recovery hospital. The NHS said its plan was supported by more than 60% of respondents to a 2020 consultation.  But at the county council scrutiny committee meeting on Tuesday, several speakers and councillors urged another government review. Local resident Vivian Wilson said: ""It's 21 years since the closure of one of the two wards at Teignmouth Hospital. It is six years since the other one was closed. The loss of those two wards is now a primary cause of bed-blocking at Torbay. ""Prior to that, Teignmouth Hospital was the perfect pit-stop for patients between Torbay Hospital and home."" Ms Wilson mentioned specific cases of ""poor aftercare"" as a result, later adding: ""This is why we've been fighting to save Teignmouth Hospital - a valued outpost to Torbay since 1954 and it should be again."" Afterwards, a spokesperson for the NHS in Devon said: ""The way we provide care in the Teignmouth and Dawlish area is very successful and receives very positive feedback from patients and carers. ""Our model of providing care gives us more capacity than a rehabilitation ward would - when we consulted with local people in 2020, we estimated that we could treat four times as many people in their own homes as we could in a rehabilitation ward in Teignmouth Hospital with the same investment.""

Lee Corrie, of West Cliff, Dawlish, assaulted his partner repeatedly over three days, biting her thigh, and using a knife to cut her legs and arms, Exeter Crown Court heard. Corrie, 32, admitted causing actual bodily harm and criminal damage. He was jailed for one year and ten months. The attack started within hours of Corrie being given bail for earlier abuse of his wife, Jade.  She was left with cuts and bruises which a judge said went from head to toe and amounted to torture. Corrie broke strict conditions not to contact her by ringing her from Exeter prison before his release on bail on 28 September and meeting her near the gates. After returning to her flat, Corrie accused her of seeing other men.  He took her keys, told her she was his hostage, and started a long series of attacks, the court heard. Corrie stifled her screams by putting his hand over her mouth and held the knife to her throat and eyes, telling her he would blind her if she called for help. Sentencing, Judge David Evans told Corrie: ""It would appear on the face of it that in a sadistic action, you dragged a knife across her legs. You bit her leg, causing a tell-tale round bruise. ""You harmed her badly and terrorised her. She was covered from head to toe in cuts and bruises. You assaulted and terrorised her over a long time. ""The way you treated her was akin to torture. You used a knife and your teeth as weapons."" He imposed a restraining order banning Corrie from any further contact with his wife or her mother for three years."

Prof Hawking was the first to set out a theory of cosmology as a union of relativity and quantum mechanics.  He also discovered that black holes leak energy and fade to nothing - a phenomenon that would later become known as Hawking radiation.  Through his work with mathematician Sir Roger Penrose he demonstrated that Einstein's general theory of relativity implies space and time would have a beginning in the Big Bang and an end in black holes. The scientist gained popularity outside the academic world and appeared in several TV shows including The Simpsons, Red Dwarf and The Big Bang Theory. He was portrayed in both TV and film - recently by Oscar winner Eddie Redmayne in The Theory of Everything, which charted his rise to fame and relationship with his first wife, Jane.  The actor paid tribute to him, saying:  ""We have lost a truly beautiful mind, an astonishing scientist and the funniest man I have ever had the pleasure to meet."" Benedict Cumberbatch, who played Prof Hawking in a BBC drama, said he was ""a true inspiration for me and for millions around the world"". His most famous book - A Brief History of Time - has now shot to the top of the Amazon Best Sellers list. The Motor Neurone Disease Association, of which Prof Hawking had been a patron since 2008, reported that its website had crashed because of an influx of donations to the charity.  Tributes have poured in for Prof Hawking since the announcement of his death.  Prof Lord Martin Rees, the Astronomer Royal, who was at university with Prof Hawking when he was diagnosed, said his friend had ""amazing willpower and determination"".  Prime Minister Theresa May called him a ""brilliant and extraordinary mind"" and ""one of the great scientists of his generation"". Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn praised the scientist for his ""determination to explain the mysteries of the cosmos"" and his ""burning passion to protect our National Health Service."" Sir Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the web, said: ""We have lost a colossal mind and a wonderful spirit. Rest in peace, Stephen Hawking,"" he said. The vice chancellor of the University of Cambridge - where Prof Hawking had studied and worked - Professor Stephen Toope, said he was a ""unique individual"" who would be remembered with ""warmth and affection"".  Prof James Hartle, who worked with him to create the Hartle-Hawking wavefunction to explain the Big Bang, said Prof Hawking had a ""unique"" ability to ""see through all the clutter in physics"" and get to the point.   He told BBC Radio Four's Today programme: ""My memory of him would be… first our work together as scientists and, second, as a human being whose whole story is a triumph over adversity [and] who inspired a lot of people, including me."" The comedian and presenter of the BBC's Stargazing Live Dara O'Briain said the scientist had an ""immeasurable life"" and ""one of the few people I would call a hero of mine"". Theoretical physicist, professor Jim Al-Khalili, from Surrey University said Prof Hawking had a tremendous sense of humour.  He told BBC Radio Surrey: ""He was a fun loving guy. Inside that shell, inside that body that was paralysed, was someone who was full of vigour, full of passion for life."" British astronaut Tim Peake said Prof Hawking ""inspired generations to look beyond our own blue planet and expand our understanding of the universe"". Gian Giudice, head of theoretical physics at the European nuclear research laboratory CERN, said Prof Hawking had a ""great impact"" on the centre's research, adding: ""A giant of our field has left us, but his immortal contributions will remain forever."" Apple's co-founder Steve Wozniak said: ""Stephen Hawking's integrity and scientific dedication placed him above pure brilliance,"" In his 2013 memoir he described how he felt when first diagnosed with motor neurone disease.  ""I felt it was very unfair - why should this happen to me,"" he wrote. ""At the time, I thought my life was over and that I would never realise the potential I felt I had. But now, 50 years later, I can be quietly satisfied with my life."" Speaking to the BBC in 2002, his mother, Isobelle, described him as a ""very normal young man"".  She said: ""He liked parties. He liked pretty girls - only pretty ones. He liked adventure and he did, to some extent, like work."""
Hawkish,Sarah Jessica Parker defended by co-star,2024-09-25,2018-02-12,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-43031016,"Molly Shannon has defended her co-star Sarah Jessica Parker after she was called ""cruel"" by Kim Cattrall. The Divorce star, who plays Parker's friend on the show, said she was ""supportive and so wonderful"". It comes after Cattrall publicly criticised Sex and the City castmate Parker for sending condolences after her brother Chris' death.  He was found dead last Sunday after going missing from his home in Alberta, Canada.  ""I didn't read about that,"" Shannon said regarding Cattrall's Instagram post. ""But I know, for me, Sarah is just so supportive and so wonderful and we just get along so well.  ""It doesn't really feel like work because we have so much in common, and she loves funny women and is just so genuinely supportive and kind, and, like, a girls' girl."" In the interview with Entertainment Tonight from New York Fashion Week, Shannon called SJP ""Hollywood royalty"". It comes after Cattrall publicly criticised Parker on social media, after she offered condolences following the death of Chris Cattrall. Parker posted on social media: ""Dearest Kim, my love and condolences to you and yours and Godspeed to your beloved brother."" Cattrall rejected the message, writing that Parker was ""exploiting our tragedy in order to restore your 'nice girl' persona."" The actress also linked underneath to a New York Post article from 2017 about the ""Mean Girls culture"", which was responsible for ending the Sex and City franchise. It didn't contain any interviews with stars of the show, but claims Cattrall had been negatively painted by Parker as a diva to fans waiting for a third Sex and the City film to be made. It also alleged that Parker and the other stars of the show, Cynthia Nixon and Kristin Davis, were jealous of Cattrall, routinely ignoring her during filming.  However, fellow Sex and the City co-star, Cynthia Nixon, got a completely different message when she contacted Cattrall following the death of her brother. ""Cynthia, hearing your voice meant so much to me. Thank you for reaching out,"" Cattrall posted on her Instagram - suggesting Nixon had called the 61-year-old rather than posting on social media.  News of a feud between Cattrall and Parker emerged late in 2017, when Cattrall said in an interview with Piers Morgan that she had ""never been friends"" with any of her castmates when filming Sex and the City. The interview came after it was announced there would be no Sex and the City 3 film, with fingers being pointed at Cattrall for pulling the plug.  At that time, Parker responded to Cattrall's comments by saying she was ""just heartbroken"", adding, ""that's not the way I recall our experience"".  On Monday, Morgan came to the defence of Cattrall, saying he was ""100% behind"" her decision to call out Parker on Instagram. Others to have weighed in on social media include actor and comedian Greg Poehler. Author and scriptwriter Jon Ronson said he wanted to ""fix the rift"" between the two Sex and the City stars.

Hawkish,What's in US debt ceiling deal and who won?,2024-09-25,2023-05-29,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-65744615,"Congress has approved a deal to raise the government's borrowing limit and prevent a potentially catastrophic default on US debt repayments. The agreement passed the Senate on Thursday, a day after it passed the House of Representatives. Once signed into law by President Joe Biden, it will allow the federal government to borrow money until after the next presidential election in November 2024. Here are the highlights from the package, with analysis by BBC North America correspondent Nomia Iqbal. Every so often, US Congress must vote to raise or suspend the ceiling, so it can borrow more to pay its bills. Currently it is $31.4tn (£25tn). This includes paying for federal employees, the military, Social Security and Medicare, as well as interest on the national debt and tax refunds. But in recent years, this has become increasingly difficult, because the two sides cannot agree on the terms. In the deal that passed through Congress, they have not raised the limit to a certain level, but suspended it entirely until 2025. This allows them to pay their bills until that date and know that the next fight over raising the ceiling will not interfere with the presidential election. And the rest of the world can breathe a sigh of relief once the deal is signed because a US default would have a global impact. Republicans wanted a freeze on overall spending for 10 years, with a rise in defence spending and cuts to other budgets. The agreement keeps non-defence spending flat next year, with a 1% rise in 2025. The implications of this belt tightening is as yet unclear. Defence spending would increase to $886bn, which amounts to a 3% rise on this year. There are no budget caps after 2025. The legislation will result in $1.5tn in savings over a decade, the independent Congressional Budget Office has said. Full funding for the medical care of military veterans would also increase, in line with what President Biden had sought. Nomia: Both sides claim victory here. The White House says these cuts are not significant. The defence spending rise is what President Biden wanted but it's below the rate of inflation and doesn't meet the demands of the more hawkish Republicans.  With the public health emergency officially ended in May, Republicans had argued for the relief funds that were not spent to be returned. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated this will amount to about $30bn. Nomia: A win for Republicans. Many Democrats were concerned public health initiatives would be impacted by this, but it was easier for Biden to give up than other Republican priorities like Medicaid work requirements.  A central demand of Republicans was to toughen up the distribution of welfare benefits by attaching strings that would mean able-bodied recipients having to work to get food and healthcare help. Democrats were adamant this should not be on the table. The welfare being looked at by Republicans included Medicaid (health coverage for poor Americans), the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF). Medicaid remains untouched in the deal, but the age at which work requirements are included for those on SNAP was raised from 50 to 54. Nomia: The White House will be happy it gained exceptions to the food stamp requirements for veterans and people who are homeless but stricter work requirements overall are a win for Republicans. It proved to be a hard sell for progressive Democratic lawmakers. A win for Democrats was securing $80bn for a decade to help the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to enforce the tax code in last year's Inflation Reduction Act on the richest. Nomia: The Republicans wanted to dump the $80bn in IRS funding, claiming it would be used to hire an army of agents to audit Americans - the agency said it would also be used to modernise the system. Instead - in showcasing his deal-making skills - Biden agreed to cut $20bn but divert that cash to other non-defence spending. New rules will make it easier for both fossil fuel and renewable energy projects to get licences. This has long been advocated by Democratic Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia.  It will basically streamline the environmental review process and potentially get projects off the ground in a faster time. Nomia: A win and a loss for the White House. Both parties agree it takes far too long for new energy infrastructure to be built but disagree on what projects should be prioritised. Republicans want more gas pipelines and fossil fuel projects; Democrats want more clean energy. This was another red line for some progressive Democrats.   Student loan relief Republicans had wanted the Biden plan to forgive student debt to be rescinded but it survived. Nomia: The Biden administration's student debt case will be ultimately decided by the Supreme Court. But the bill does require the Biden administration to follow through with a plan to end the current pause - which has been in effect since the start of the pandemic - on student loan repayments by the end of summer.  Tax hikes Democrats had targeted wealthy Americans for new tax hikes but there are no new taxes here.  Nomia: House Democrats will be fuming about this. They were already critical that the White House did not make taxes on the rich and powerful the centrepiece of their talks.  Clean energy Republicans had wanted to repeal key provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act's clean energy and climate provisions but it was unscathed.  Nomia: A win for both - certainly as far as environmentalists are concerned.  The US renewable energy industry group the American Clean Power Association said it ""applauds President Joe Biden and Speaker Kevin McCarthy for prioritising national interests over partisan politics"".

Hawkish,Sentry box converted into traditional 'peep box',2024-09-25,2022-07-14,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-62150399,"An old sentry box on a Devon seafront has been renovated and turned into a ""peep box"". The box - outside Teignmouth's Grand Pier - allows people to look inside and see how the town looked in old and more recent times. It is the latest part of a project to bring traditional seaside entertainment back to resorts in Devon. Dr Tony Lidington, from the University of Exeter, led the scheme and said it is providing ""joyful fun"".  Users of the converted 1920s sentry box will be able to look inside and illuminate old and new images of the town by pressing a button. The images include a bank holiday in Teignmouth in the 1950s, a poster for a concert in the town by local band Muse and views of the seafront.  Dr Liddington is an expert in theatre history and puts on shows in Teignmouth, Dawlish, Torquay and Exeter with slapstick, variety skills, songs and Punch and Judy shows. He said: ""It is so exciting to provide lasting infrastructural changes to animate the seafront, alongside our usual, more transient entertainments.  ""We are demonstrating that art, technology and research can combine powerfully to unite political and social agencies, as well as providing accessible and joyful fun.""  The renovations have been funded by Devon County Council and Teignbridge District Council. Cllr David Cox organised the work and said ""the new sentry box will be a fantastic asset to the town.""

Hawkish,Stars turn out for Hawking memorial,2024-09-25,2018-06-15,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-44494389,"Tributes have been paid to renowned physicist Prof Stephen Hawking in a Westminster Abbey memorial service. British actor Benedict Cumberbatch, who played Hawking in a BBC drama, and astronaut Tim Peake were among those giving readings at the ceremony. Prof Hawking died in March, aged 76, after a long battle with motor neurone disease. His ashes are being buried alongside other great scientists like Charles Darwin and Isaac Newton. English Astronomer Royal, Lord Martin Rees, and Prof Hawking's collaborator and Nobel prize winner, Kip Thorne, also gave tributes during the service. TV personalities David Walliams and Piers Morgan, musician Nile Rodgers and Prof Brian Cox were among those who joined members of the public to celebrate the life of the scientist. Prof Cox said Hawking was a true inspiration and recalled the effect the Cambridge physicist's book, A Brief History of Time, had on him as a 20 year-old. He told BBC News: ""I'd done physics up to A-level but I was a musician at the time; and I was in that process of 'shall I do music or shall I do physics?' When that book came out my mum and dad bought it for me for Christmas. I read it and it re-affirmed - it really did - that [physics] is what I'd like to spend my life doing."" To mark the occasion, the European Space Agency beamed Prof Hawking's words towards the nearest black hole to Earth. The transmission, which was sent from a big radio dish in Spain, was backed by an original score from composer Vangelis. Stephen Hawking said that science would take us on a path to ""the mind of God"". By that he meant that we would know everything that God would know, with the caveat, ""if there were a God, which there isn't. I'm an atheist."" On the face of it, the religious ceremony at Westminster Abbey was at odds with Prof Hawking's personal views. But hearing the choral works of Wagner, Mahler, Stravinsky, Elgar - and, of course, Holst's The Planets - filling the vast halls of the Gothic Abbey, one's mind was lifted beyond Earthly matters towards the ethereal. And that is what he did through his work - unravelling the mysteries of the Universe. Read more from Pallab One thousand members of the public, from more than 100 countries, were offered the opportunity to attend the service, after a ballot attracted 25,000 applications for tickets. Guests were welcomed by volunteers from the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Paralympic Games. Also at the service were students who all use electronic communication devices to enable them to speak - just as Prof Hawking did. Rose Brown, 20, a student at the National Star College in Cheltenham, a college for young people with disabilities and learning difficulties, said it was a great honour to be present. Speaking through her synthesiser, she said: ""He showed what people with disabilities can do. ""I'm going to be an actress; everybody who puts their mind to something gets to be it. Stephen Hawking proved that more than anyone."" ❝A man of great humour, he became a popular ambassador for science and was always careful to ensure that the general public had ready access to his work.❞ Read the obituary in full"

Hawkish,Hawking thanksgiving service ballot closes,2024-09-25,2018-05-16,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-44140512,"Organisers of a public ballot for places at a thanksgiving service for Professor Stephen Hawking said the number of applicants ""could have filled Westminster Abbey 12 times"". The ballot for 1,000 places at the 15 June service closed at midnight. More than 27,500 people applied to attend the memorial for the theoretical physicist, who died in March aged 76. A ""randomiser"" programme will be used to pick those who will be invited to the service in London next month. Within 24 hours of the opening of the ballot, about 12,000 people from more than 50 countries had applied for tickets. When it closed at 23:59 BST on Tuesday, thousands more applications had come in from 117 countries, including two people from the tiny islands of Tuvalu in the South Pacific. More than 450 schools also applied. They are allowed to bring up to four pupils plus a teacher, as Prof Hawking's family was particularly keen children should attend. When the ballot opened it was suggested time travellers might be able to attend as applicants needed to give their birth date - which could be any day up to 31 December 2038. A spokesman from the Stephen Hawking Foundation, which organised the ballot, said their attendance could not be excluded as the possibility of time travel had not been disproven. However, as the ballot closed, he added: ""It occurs to me that any time travellers attending will need to have set up an email address in this time for them to receive notification.  ""I'm not sure quite how they will achieve this, but it's a minor concern compared to their other challenges."" The professor's ashes are to be interred between Sir Isaac Newton and Charles Darwin."
Hawkish,Stars gather in Hollywood for Golden Globes,2024-09-25,2020-01-05,By Paul Glynn,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-50981723,"The 77th Golden Globe Awards take place in Los Angeles, California on Sunday evening. The awards, which celebrate excellence in film and television, are dished out on behalf of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA) - who'll be hoping to set the agenda once again ahead of next month's Oscars (they're right about that roughly half the time). And despite it being #DryJanuary for some, many Tinseltown stars have traditionally been known to enjoy a drink or three on the night, making for interesting viewing. But if you don't have an invitation (or even a tuxedo) then don't worry, as we're about to tell you what you need to know. Ricky Gervais is back to present the Golden Globes for the fifth time this year. He says this will be his ""very last"" time fronting it, though we'd take that assertion with a shovel of salt as he's said it before. The English comedian, actor and writer has entertained and offended in equal measure on his previous four outings since 2010. The 58-year-old told The Hollywood Reporter that once US broadcaster NBC asked him to host again, he thought ""that's Christmas ruined"", as he had to start work right away on scripting his best put-downs. ""People think that I'd go out there and I'd get drunk and say off-the-cuff [things],"" he said. ""I don't. I write jokes."" The Office and After Life creator admitted it's fun to poke fun at some of the ""privileged egos in the room"" on behalf of the millions of people watching at home, but that he's ever more conscious of making sure his jokes are ""bulletproof"". ""Nowadays, you've got to make sure they're bulletproof in 10 years' time, with people going through saying: 'He said this once, 10 years [ago]'. Kevin Hart [lost] his job [as Oscars host] for 10-year-old tweets that he said he was sorry about and deleted at the time."" On Thursday, the Golden Globes announced a raft of celebrities who will hand out individual awards on the night, including nominees Margot Robbie, Rami Malek, Scarlett Johansson, Brad Pitt, Leonardo DiCaprio, Charlize Theron and Daniel Craig. They'll all be praying for kinder introductions from Gervais than the likes of Mel Gibson, Johnny Depp and Matt Damon have endured in previous years (gulp!). Harvey Keitel, Chris Evans, Glenn Close, Reese Witherspoon and previous host Amy Poehler would be wise to have something witty up their sleeves too, as well as Salma Hayek, Will Ferrell, Dakota Fanning, Tiffany Haddish and Pierce Brosnan. Let's hope none of the above have just vowed to take themselves more seriously as their New Year's resolution. A lot of the focus this year will be on the many British stars who have taken US screens by storm, receiving a combined 27 nominations. Olivia Colman's regal performance in The Crown, Dame Helen Mirren's Catherine the Great and Jodie Comer being dead-set on Killing Eve sees them all listed in the acting categories, alongside Fleabag star and creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge. The darkly comic show, which recently returned to the West End as its original one-woman stage show, is also nominated for best musical or comedy series. Kit Harrington is the ""loner Throner"", as he put it.  In other words the only member of Game of Thrones cast to be nominated this year, in the best drama actor category for his role as the longsuffering Jon Snow. Rocketman star Taron Egerton is going to be hi-i-igh as a kite (emotionally speaking) if he takes the best actor gong, in the musical or comedy section. The freshly-knighted Sir Sam Mendes, meanwhile, could pick up best director for his war film 1917. Another interesting subplot to this year's awards is the emergence of streaming giants Netflix as an original creative force to be reckoned with, having 17 nods apiece in both the TV and film sections. Marriage Story, directed by Noah Baumbach, is the most nominated film all told, being up for six awards, while Martin Scorsese's similarly Netflix-backed epic, The Irishman, is up for five. Their Vatican drama, The Two Popes, has four nods too, while Eddie Murphy is the frontrunner to win best comedy actor for the blaxploitation biopic Dolomite Is My Name.  All of which demonstrates that Netflix - who previously only really had the Oscar-winning Roma to show for their investment since 2015 - aren't messing about. Away from Netflix, Quentin Tarantino's movie Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is bound to interest plenty of the Hollywood types in the room and that has five nominations, including nods for stars Pitt and DiCaprio - who remarkably acted alongside each other for the first time. Joaquin Phoenix winning best drama actor for his portrayal of the pre-Batman Joker would almost certainly put a smile his face. One thing we can be certain of already is that the award for best director will (once again) not be going to a woman. Since 2000, the awards show has nominated more than 100 men for the category, and only four women. Five men are nominated this year alone. Two years ago, when presenting the award, Natalie Portman delivered a pointed: ""Here are the all-male nominees"". HFPA president Lorenzo Soria recently told Variety: ""What happened is that we don't vote by gender. We vote by film and accomplishment."" With that in mind, the omission of Little Women filmmaker Greta Gerwig from the list was particularly notable this time around. ""There are so many beautiful films made by women this year,"" Gerwig told AFP last month, adding the overall low number of female-directed movies was ""dreadful"" for the industry. While #DryJanuary may well be ditched for the night, in a move that appears to have maddened some of the UK tabloids, the Golden Globes have decided to fully embrace #Veganuary. Guests on Sunday will be having a completely meat free plant-based Sunday dinner. Soria told The Associated Press the menu change was in order to raise awareness of climate change. ""If there's a way we can, not change the world, but save the planet, maybe we can get the Golden Globes to send a signal and draw attention to the issue about climate change,"" he declared. Food for thought indeed. There's bound to be some spuds and sprouts leftover from the Christmas celebrations at the Beverly Hilton, whatever happens...

Hawkish,Obituary: Donald Rumsfeld,2024-09-25,2021-06-30,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-54889848,"Donald Rumsfeld, who served as secretary of defence for President Gerald Ford and President George W Bush, has died aged 88. Best known for overseeing the US response to the 9/11 terror attacks, his political career eventually came undone by the spiralling conflict in Iraq.  Across a career spanning decades, Rumsfeld forged a reputation as the ultimate Washington insider and a true political survivor notorious for outmanoeuvring his foes. But to his critics he was hawkish and ruthless - a Machiavellian figure and an architect of war. One of his most memorable moments came at a 2002 news briefing when - asked about the lack of evidence linking Saddam Hussein to weapons of mass destruction - he gave a meandering answer about the concept of ""known knowns"" and ""known unknowns"" to much public mockery.  Donald Henry Rumsfeld was born in Chicago on 9 July 1932. His father, a real estate salesman, was enlisted in the Navy during WW2. In childhood, Rumsfeld was an Eagle Scout who went on to find a love of wrestling. After studying political science at Princeton University on a naval scholarship, he followed in his father's footsteps to enlist and served as an aviator and flight instructor between 1954 and 1957. After transferring to the reserves, he came to Washington DC first as an assistant to a congressman before being elected himself to the US House of Representatives for Illinois in 1962. Rumsfeld resigned his post in 1969 to direct Richard Nixon's Office of Economic Opportunity, before serving in several other positions in the administration including as US ambassador to Nato from 1973-74. After Nixon's resignation over the Watergate scandal, Rumsfeld was named first as Gerald Ford's transition chairman then as his chief of staff.  He was then appointed Secretary of Defence in a 1975 cabinet reshuffle and, aged 43, became the youngest to hold the post. Serving at a time when US policy was still dominated by Cold War anxiety, Rumsfeld oversaw the development of the Trident nuclear submarine and ""peacekeeper"" MX intercontinental ballistic missile programmes. He also famously undermined Henry Kissinger's work on Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT II) with the Soviets during this time. After Ford lost out to Jimmy Carter and left office in 1977, Rumsfeld moved into the private sector while maintaining some part-time federal commitments and roles on the side - including, at one point, serving as special envoy to the Middle East for President Ronald Reagan.  He spent almost a decade in senior management of pharmaceutical firm GD Searle & Co and served as CEO and chairman at electronics manufacturer General Instrument before returning to pharmaceuticals as chairman of Gilead Sciences.  Never far away from politics, he was chosen to head up a bipartisan commission to assess the ballistic missile threat to the United States in 1998. The probe was ignited by sharp criticism of intelligence assessments under the Clinton administration which played down the security risk to continental North America following the collapse of the Soviet Union. The Rumsfeld Report, as the findings came to be known, argued that the US faced a growing threat from overtly or potentially hostile nations including North Korea, Iraq and Iran. It suggested that these states could potentially inflict ""major destruction"" on the US within five years of deciding to pursue a missile capability - far shorter than the 15 years predicted by intelligence estimates. The findings revived intense debate over the nation's missile defence systems and defence policy.  After the knife-edge 2000 election, Rumsfeld was nominated to serve again as defence secretary under George W Bush. Once the youngest to take the post, he became - at the time - the oldest. A veteran welcomed by party conservatives, Rumsfeld had already served as an adviser to Bush's campaign on foreign policy. Bush described his appointee as a man of ""great judgement"" with a ""strong vision"". In the president's cabinet, Rumsfeld found strong personalities in Colin Powell as Secretary of State and Vice-President Dick Cheney - who had succeeded him as Ford's chief of staff back in the 1970s. A priority for the Bush administration had been readying the Pentagon to deal with new and evolving security threats - with Rumsfeld put in charge of the attempt to revamp and streamline a military seen as resistant to change.  His frank approach to reassert civilian control was widely reported to have offended military top brass in the early days of the administration.  But then, less than nine months into the presidency, the US came under unprecedented attack.  Rumsfeld had been holding a Pentagon breakfast meeting with congressmen to try and garner support for missile defence when the World Trade Center was targeted on the morning of 11 September 2001. Insisting on continuing with his daily briefings, Rumsfeld was still inside when the defence headquarters itself was hit with another hijacked aircraft.  He would later recall feeling the building shake and running toward the crash site - leading to a scramble as officials struggled to locate him. ""Outside I found fresh air and a chaotic scene,"" he wrote. ""For the first time I could see the clouds of black smoke rising from the west side of the building. I ran along the Pentagon's perimeter, and then saw the flames."" Video footage aired on CNN showed Rumsfeld helping to stretcher someone to safety before going back inside to help co-ordinate the nation's response. Evidence would later emerge in declassified notes that within hours of the attack, Rumsfeld was already floating the idea of retaliatory strikes on not just Osama Bin Laden - the main suspect - but on Saddam Hussein's Iraq too.  The initial response was to foreshadow what was to come.  On 7 October, less than a month after the attack, US forces began an air campaign against al-Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan. A swift ground campaign followed, improving Rumsfeld's reputation as he provided regular updates at briefings.  But by 2002, the Bush administration's attention had turned to Iraq. The president singled out the country - along with Iran and North Korea - as part of what he dubbed the ""axis of evil"" whom he said threatened the peace of the world by pursuing weapons of mass destruction.  It was just weeks after that State of the Union address when Rumsfeld was asked about the lack of evidence at a Pentagon briefing and responded with his famous ""known and unknowns"" retort. The concept was not invented by Rumsfeld - but the response nonetheless brought widespread ridicule at the time given the controversy over the Bush administration's stance and push for war. After giving up on getting a resolution authorising the use of force passed at the UN, the US and UK pressed ahead with plans to invade alone. Operation Iraqi Freedom began in March 2003 despite continued questions over their evidence and rationale.  Rumsfeld, one of the most hawkish in the cabinet, was seen as a key architect of the conflict. That year he predicted in a memo the wars would be a ""a long, hard slog"" - something history proved as painfully true, with US troops still embroiled in exiting the conflicts almost two decades on.  The defence head was never far away from news headlines and blunders. Rumsfeld's time in office was dogged by criticism over his handling of the conflicts and he built a reputation for his candid and controversial off-the-cuff remarks.  But Bush stood resolute by him, even in the wake of the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse scandal - where photographs of US troops posing next to Iraqi prisoners in humiliating poses were leaked.  By then it was clear that despite the fear and rhetoric - Iraq had no stockpiles of biological, chemical or nuclear weapons prior to the invasion. And as insurgency and violence spiralled, so did questions over Rumsfeld's leadership and he found himself under mounting pressure to quit. Rumsfeld said he offered to resign twice over Abu Ghraib, but the president continued to back him and even asked him to stay on in the post after he won re-election in November 2004.  It took two more years, and bruising losses for the Republicans in the 2006 mid-term elections, for Bush to finally acknowledge a ""fresh perspective"" on the conflict was needed. By this time Rumsfeld had weathered public criticism over equipment from members of the military themselves and even an admission he had used a machine to sign signatures on the condolence letters to the families of dead soldiers. The president remained complimentary of his outgoing pick's work and legacy. But his own father, George Bush Senior, was not as positive - later describing Rumsfeld as ""an arrogant fellow"" who he believed had hurt his son's presidency. In his 2011 memoir, Rumsfeld remained largely defiant over the war's handling - though he did express regret over some of his comments and conceded the US could have sent more troops into Iraq. In 2013 he was the subject of The Unknown Known - a documentary by Academy Award winning director Errol Morris.  The filmmaker set out to delve inside Rumsfeld's mind like he had with former Secretary of Defence Robert S McNamara in The Fog of War, but later conceded that after 33 hours of interviews with the enigmatic Rumsfeld, he seemed to know even less about the origins of the Iraq war than when he started the project.  He compared meeting Donald Rumsfeld to Alice in Wonderland's perplexing encounter with the Cheshire Cat in the Lewis Carroll classic.  ""I was left with the frightening suspicion that the grin might not be hiding anything,"" he wrote in the New York Times. ""It was a grin of supreme self-satisfaction and behind the grin might be nothing at all."""
Hawkish,Rail upgrade works to prevent future landslips,2024-09-25,2022-09-21,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-62970825,"Work to prevent landslips on a rail line in Devon means some passengers will face disruption this week. The line between Axminster and Pinhoe is closed until Friday. Tunnel upgrades, landslip prevention and anti-flood work aim to ""make the line more reliable for customers"", Network Rail said. The changes are costing £5m and should help prevent landslips at Honiton tunnel. Mark Killick, Network Rail's Wessex route director, said: ""While we have tiny electronic sensors in the ground at Honiton Tunnel to monitor any movement so we can keep our passengers safe, it's incredibly important that we carry out these works to stabilise the earth so we can prevent future landslips and lengthy disruption."" Network Rail said it was one of the most at-risk sites in the south of England. The works will also improving existing drainage systems and install a new one, making the line more resilient to extreme weather and heavy rainfall. East Devon District Council will also use the railway closure to complete a project to protect 65 homes in Feniton from flooding. Customers are advised to check available services and replacement buses between Axminster and Exeter before travelling. Peter Williams, South Western Railway's commercial director, said: ""We recognise the decision to close the line for an entire working week will have a significant impact on those who use the line, but this will avoid a more protracted series of closures instead. ""We would like to thank those affected customers for their patience and understanding as this important modernisation work is carried out.""

Hawkish,World media hot-spots judge John Bolton’s legacy,2024-09-25,2019-09-11,By BBC Monitoring,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-49662600,"Media outlets in global hot-spots see the firing of hawkish US national security advisor John Bolton as a likely boost for Donald Trump's talks with US foes in Afghanistan, North Korea and other sensitive areas.  But what do the media from these countries make of John Bolton's legacy, and the way forward now? State TV channel Rossiya 1 describes Mr Bolton as a ""classic hawk of American politics"" with a hard stance on Iran, Venezuela and Russia. ""Bolton is known as the person who is ready to bomb any problem,"" its correspondent says. Russian state TV Channel One brands the outgoing national security adviser a ""hawk of hawks"", over a screen caption saying ""House of Cards"". The channel says Mr Bolton presided over the cancellation of the US-Russia Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty and ""came to predict the end"" of another arms control agreement - the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty. Its correspondent calls Mr Bolton ""the architect of this new America of Donald Trump's - an America not bound by international agreements"". Russia does not expect its ties with Washington to suddenly improve following Mr Bolton's exit, RIA news agency cites Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov as saying. Such staff reshuffles in the United States have not led to a normalisation in relations in the past, he says.  Iranian newspapers are reporting the story prominently. Arman newspaper carries the headline ""Chaos in the White House"" while Sharq daily asks ""Was Bolton sacrificed for Iran?"" One of President Hassan Rouhani's advisers said the sacking points to a failure of Washington's ""maximum pressure strategy"" against Iran.  ""The marginalisation and subsequent elimination of Bolton is not an accident but a decisive sign of the failure of the US maximum pressure strategy in the face of the constructive resistance of Iran,"" Hesameddin Ashena tweeted.  Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and Iran's envoy to the UN, Majid Takht-Ravanchi, are refusing to comment on ""America's internal matters"", according to Iranian state TV. Newspapers in Israel see Mr Bolton's departure as a blow for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Mr Bolton was Mr Netanyahu's ""most enthusiastic supporter in Washington"", says Amos Harel, defence analyst for Haaretz, calling his departure ""a significant shift in policy towards Iran"".  That's echoed by commentator Noa Landau in the same paper:  ""The sacking of US National Security Adviser John Bolton, considered especially hawkish in the Iranian issue and the last obstacle before Trump's talks with the Iranian president, is a serious blow to Netanyahu's policy on the Iranian nuclear issue - it is a nightmare Netanyahu feared in recent weeks."" For Herb Keinon in The Jerusalem Post, Mr Bolton's dismissal means Mr Netanyahu is losing a strong advocate in Trump's inner circle. But he warns that the implications go beyond the Iran issue.  ""It is no coincidence that the whole push to get US recognition of the Golan Heights began with a visit to Israel by Bolton in January, when Netanyahu made his first public appeal to the US for recognition of Israel's sovereignty over the strategic plateau. Bolton was also key in getting Trump to back away from promises to withdraw US troops from Syria, and has long been very sceptical of the reality of a two-state solution for solving the Palestinian issue."" In North Korea, state media have so far not been observed to cover the developments. But the North is likely to welcome Mr Bolton's departure, given that he has long been a target of its ire. In the past, the North's media have fiercely attacked him as ""a security-destroying adviser"", a ""warmonger,"" a ""structurally defective guy"" and a ""human defect"" that ""deserves an earlier vanishing."" But the view today from South Korea's state news agency Yonhap is that Mr Bolton's departure ""may bring flexibility to the upcoming nuclear talks with North Korea but could undercut efforts to achieve the regime's complete denuclearisation.""  Mr Bolton's removal comes as the United States and the North are expected to resume their nuclear talks later this month amid tension caused by military exercises in the South.  Venezuelan pro-government newspaper Ultimas Noticias quotes Vice-President for Economy Tareck El Aissami as saying on Twitter that Bolton was the one who ""lied the most about our people and caused them most damage"".  ""Historical truth defeated the demons of war,"" the politician tweeted.  Ultimas Noticias also notes that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said that US foreign policy towards Venezuela ""will not change, thus economic, financial and commercial blockades against the country will remain"". Venezuela's news website Tal Cual believes John Bolton ""was a key element in the US government's pressure campaign against the Nicolas Maduro's regime. His critical role was that he was considered by many officials as a spokesman for the Venezuelan opposition."" Turkey's nationalist Sozcu newspaper highlights the tension that has grown between Ankara and Washington over the purchase of Russian S-400 air defence missiles - and puts the blame on John Bolton.   ""One of the most important subjects that Trump disagreed with Bolton over was in relation to Turkey. And one of the names that led the camp that defended imposing harsh sanctions against Turkey as part of the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) was John Bolton, along with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo,"" it notes. In Lebanon, Samih Saab of the Al-Nahar newspaper declares: ""On the road between Washington and Tehran, John Bolton fell.""  He says Mr Bolton ""was the one who convinced Trump to re-impose sanctions and put the 'utmost pressure' on Iran"".   Iran is suffering from an economic war, but the regime has not fallen, he says. ""And this has presented Trump with difficult options"". BBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

Hawkish,May's future and Johnson 'targets No 10',2024-09-25,2019-05-16,By BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-the-papers-48304282,"Many of the front pages feature stories about Theresa May's decision regarding her future as Conservative leader. The Financial Times says Mrs May has finally bowed to the inevitable by confirming her departure in June, regardless of whether she secures support for her Brexit deal. The Daily Mirror describes how she was left in tears after being forced to announce a date to finally quit. Tears welled in her eyes as she made her argument to stay in Downing Street a little longer, says the Daily Telegraph, but the sympathy and patience of senior Tories on the 1922 Committee had run out.    The Guardian says the heavy hint that Mrs May will resign if her withdrawal bill legislation is rejected once again is likely to incentivise even more Tory Eurosceptics to vote against it. The Daily Mail thinks her chances of success are slim, so a dignified exit is now probably for the best.   The Daily Telegraph believes her successor must learn from her mistakes - and take a clear pro-Leave line on Brexit and stick to it.  It suggests they make the case for what they are doing with conviction, because the country has not got the patience for another enigma.   Inevitably, much of the speculation about who replaces her focuses on Boris Johnson. The Daily Express says his supporters see him as someone who could neutralise the growing threat to the Tories posed by Nigel Farage's Brexit Party. The Daily Mail feels Mr Johnson has many flaws and divides opinion like no other politician, but acknowledges that he is charismatic.  James Forysth in the Spectator says he is not only back in contention but is now the man to beat.  The editor of the i newspaper, Oliver Duff, suggests the former foreign secretary remains the biggest obstacle to his own ambitions, lacking the judgement and work ethic to succeed in high office. The Independent's chief political commentator, John Rentoul, says that whether the new leader is Mr Johnson or the traditional surprise candidate, they will face the problem that the Tory party is finished if it fails to deliver Brexit.  The Sun believes that getting Brexit over the line, even via her deal, is still the best option.   With the opinion polls suggesting Nigel Farage's Brexit Party will make big gains in the European elections, Philip Collins in the Times argues that letting Brexit happen may be smarter than allowing Mr Farage to nurse a grievance about the failure to respect the referendum result. The main story in the Guardian tells how Iran's most prominent military leader has met Iraqi militias in Baghdad and told them to prepare for a proxy war in the Middle East.   The paper says the move to mobilise Iran's regional allies is understood to have triggered fears in the US that its interests in the area are facing a pressing threat. The Times says President Trump summoned the Swiss President to the White House on Thursday to ask him to open a communications channel with Iran amid fears that hawkish senior advisers were leading the US into an unwanted conflict with Tehran. The Guardian expresses concerns about the government's approach to the probation service after a series of failings led to the scrapping of the partial privatisation of the system. The paper is unhappy that Justice Secretary David Gauke says the 11 regions of the National Probation Service will required to buy all interventions from the market.  The Financial Times suggests the renationalisation leaves several issues unresolved, including the decision to boost the participation of voluntary groups and charities - a goal of the original reforms that was never realised. The Daily Telegraph interprets Prince Harry's successful legal action against a news agency which took aerial photographs of his home in the Cotswolds as a timely reminder that the normally non-litigious royals will act when they feel a line has been crossed. The Guardian thinks the prince's decision to apply for the terms of the settlement to be read in court lays down a marker in his fight to protect the privacy of his family. In Australia, there are many tributes to the country's former Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, who has died at the age of 89.   The front page of the Herald Sun, which has the headline ""Legend"", says he will be remembered as a great Australian - and many would say the greatest Australian of the post-war era.  The Courier Mail describes him as a true political giant, while the Age in Melbourne remembers him as Labor's golden boy who transformed a nation. For The Australian, the country's longest-serving Labor prime minister was the stuff of folklore, but his legacy was real and enormous.    Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning And the Daily Mail reports how £6,000 was spent on a new bus stop for a road in Rotherham, even though it does not have a bus route.   Residents were baffled when the structure was erected weeks after a local service was axed. Local people are now hoping the shelter will be moved to a rather more useful location - ideally one still served by a bus route."
Hawkish,Railways hit as snow disruption continues,2024-09-25,2018-03-03,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-43266514,"Rail passengers are facing continued disruption as weather warnings for snow and icy roads remain in place across much of the UK. Thousands of people remain without power and motorists have also been warned of delays on the roads. Meanwhile, the Environment Agency has 16 flood warnings in place in south-west and north-east England as temperatures are forecast to increase. Many rail lines across the UK are still blocked with widespread cancellations. Network Rail has urged people in London, the north-east of England and the East Midlands to only travel if ""absolutely necessary"". Virgin Trains East Coast has resumed services between Newcastle and Scotland but advised customers not to travel unless it was essential. Great Western Railway also advised passengers not to travel unless the journey is ""unavoidable"" while most rail companies urged people to check before travelling. National Rail has been advising passengers to check their service before travelling while many operators are running to a reduced timetable. The Met Office currently has two active yellow warnings in place, covering large areas of the UK.  One, which warns of further snow, is in place for north-east England and much of Scotland all day on Saturday. The second warning - in force until 11:00 GMT on Sunday - is for ice in south-east England, the Midlands, Wales and Northern Ireland. Another yellow warning for snow and ice has been issued for parts of north-east England and Scotland from Sunday until Monday.  Meanwhile, an independent investigation will be launched after passengers stuck on four stranded Southeastern trains in Lewisham, south London, ""forced open"" the carriage doors and walked along the tracks. The rail company has apologised to all passengers involved and offered compensation, explaining that trains ground to a halt because of power supply problems caused by ice.  But the incident sparked a warning from the British Transport Police which said people who self-evacuate are ""risking their lives"" while Southeastern said the passengers could have been electrocuted. In Scotland, government ministers have asked for volunteers to help in clearing up local roads and pavements, and checking on vulnerable people.  There will be a gradual rise in temperatures, with 7C predicted in Plymouth, but it will remain cold in the north.  Twelve flood warnings are in place in Devon, Cornwall and elsewhere on the south coast, while two are in the North East.  They all apply to coastal regions, due to large waves caused by spring tides and strong onshore winds. In Dawlish, Devon, the coastal rail line reopened after being closed on Saturday morning, due to flooding caused by high tides.  Network Rail said it has teams working to prepare areas at risk of flooding. In Holyhead in Wales, 87 boats broke their moorings as a result of the high winds caused by Storm Emma on Friday.  Meanwhile, thousands of trains are set to be cancelled in another day of travel disruption, as more than 20 rail operators are running a reduced service. Scotland is facing significant issues along its rail network after receiving the heaviest snowfall, and some of the coldest conditions, in the UK.  The West Coast Mainline to England remains closed, and Virgin Trains East Coast is not running any services north of Newcastle.  ScotRail said snow ploughs were tackling drifts as high as 10ft (3m).  Major incidents was also declared in Wiltshire, Hampshire and Avon and Somerset, as blizzards brought roads to a standstill.  On Saturday morning a lorry jack-knifed on junction 34 of the M4 in Wales, and Stagecoach suspended all its buses across the country due to the poor weather.  However, the M62 in Greater Manchester reopened in the early hours of Saturday, having been shut for more than a day due to severe weather conditions. Police rescued a couple and two dogs after they were trapped by a 12ft (3.6m) snow drift in their home in the Scottish Borders. In England, the Premier League has said all its football matches are expected to go ahead despite the weather. However, a number of games in the Championship and the Scottish Premiership have been postponed. Many airports have now reopened and flights are resuming but some issues still remain and passengers are being advised to check with their airlines.

Hawkish,Visionary physicist Stephen Hawking dies,2024-09-25,2018-03-14,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-43396008,"World renowned physicist Stephen Hawking has died at the age of 76. He died peacefully at his home in Cambridge in the early hours of Wednesday, his family said.  The British scientist was famed for his work with black holes and relativity, and wrote several popular science books including A Brief History of Time. At the age of 22 Prof Hawking was given only a few years to live after being diagnosed with a rare form of motor neurone disease. The illness left him in a wheelchair and largely unable to speak except through a voice synthesiser. In a statement his children, Lucy, Robert and Tim, said: ""We are deeply saddened that our beloved father passed away today. ""He was a great scientist and an extraordinary man whose work and legacy will live on for many years."" They praised his ""courage and persistence"" and said his ""brilliance and humour"" inspired people across the world. ""He once said, 'It would not be much of a universe if it wasn't home to the people you love.' We will miss him forever.""  A book of condolence has been opened at Gonville and Caius College in Cambridge, where Prof Hawking was a fellow.  Prof Hawking was the first to set out a theory of cosmology as a union of relativity and quantum mechanics.  He also discovered that black holes leak energy and fade to nothing - a phenomenon that would later become known as Hawking radiation.  Through his work with mathematician Sir Roger Penrose he demonstrated that Einstein's general theory of relativity implies space and time would have a beginning in the Big Bang and an end in black holes. The scientist gained popularity outside the academic world and appeared in several TV shows including The Simpsons, Red Dwarf and The Big Bang Theory. He was portrayed in both TV and film - recently by Oscar winner Eddie Redmayne in The Theory of Everything, which charted his rise to fame and relationship with his first wife, Jane.  The actor paid tribute to him, saying:  ""We have lost a truly beautiful mind, an astonishing scientist and the funniest man I have ever had the pleasure to meet."" Benedict Cumberbatch, who played Prof Hawking in a BBC drama, said he was ""a true inspiration for me and for millions around the world"". His most famous book - A Brief History of Time - has now shot to the top of the Amazon Best Sellers list. The Motor Neurone Disease Association, of which Prof Hawking had been a patron since 2008, reported that its website had crashed because of an influx of donations to the charity.  Tributes have poured in for Prof Hawking since the announcement of his death.  Prof Lord Martin Rees, the Astronomer Royal, who was at university with Prof Hawking when he was diagnosed, said his friend had ""amazing willpower and determination"".  Prime Minister Theresa May called him a ""brilliant and extraordinary mind"" and ""one of the great scientists of his generation"". Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn praised the scientist for his ""determination to explain the mysteries of the cosmos"" and his ""burning passion to protect our National Health Service."" Sir Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the web, said: ""We have lost a colossal mind and a wonderful spirit. Rest in peace, Stephen Hawking,"" he said. The vice chancellor of the University of Cambridge - where Prof Hawking had studied and worked - Professor Stephen Toope, said he was a ""unique individual"" who would be remembered with ""warmth and affection"".  Prof James Hartle, who worked with him to create the Hartle-Hawking wavefunction to explain the Big Bang, said Prof Hawking had a ""unique"" ability to ""see through all the clutter in physics"" and get to the point.   He told BBC Radio Four's Today programme: ""My memory of him would be… first our work together as scientists and, second, as a human being whose whole story is a triumph over adversity [and] who inspired a lot of people, including me."" The comedian and presenter of the BBC's Stargazing Live Dara O'Briain said the scientist had an ""immeasurable life"" and ""one of the few people I would call a hero of mine"". Theoretical physicist, professor Jim Al-Khalili, from Surrey University said Prof Hawking had a tremendous sense of humour.  He told BBC Radio Surrey: ""He was a fun loving guy. Inside that shell, inside that body that was paralysed, was someone who was full of vigour, full of passion for life."" British astronaut Tim Peake said Prof Hawking ""inspired generations to look beyond our own blue planet and expand our understanding of the universe"". Gian Giudice, head of theoretical physics at the European nuclear research laboratory CERN, said Prof Hawking had a ""great impact"" on the centre's research, adding: ""A giant of our field has left us, but his immortal contributions will remain forever."" Apple's co-founder Steve Wozniak said: ""Stephen Hawking's integrity and scientific dedication placed him above pure brilliance,"" In his 2013 memoir he described how he felt when first diagnosed with motor neurone disease.  ""I felt it was very unfair - why should this happen to me,"" he wrote. ""At the time, I thought my life was over and that I would never realise the potential I felt I had. But now, 50 years later, I can be quietly satisfied with my life."" Speaking to the BBC in 2002, his mother, Isobelle, described him as a ""very normal young man"".  She said: ""He liked parties. He liked pretty girls - only pretty ones. He liked adventure and he did, to some extent, like work."""
Hawkish,Bank surprises with interest rate vote,2024-09-25,2017-06-15,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-40288125,"UK interest rates have been kept on hold at 0.25%, but in a surprise move three of the Bank of England's rate-setting committee backed a rate rise. The 5-3 vote by the Bank's policymakers was the closest for a rate rise since 2007, and comes with inflation close to a four-year high of 2.9%. Inflation is now well above the Bank's target rate of 2%.  News of the vote pushed the pound up by more than a cent against the dollar, although it fell back later.   Ian McCafferty, Michael Saunders and Kristin Forbes were the three members of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) who voted for an increase. Ms Forbes had been the sole vote in favour of a rise at the MPC's previous two meetings.   However, the decision of Mr Saunders and Mr McCafferty to back an increase as well surprised economists. ""The more hawkish tone of the MPC appears to reflect some concern about inflation - which has accelerated faster than it expected over recent months and is now forecast to exceed 3% this year - as well as the strength of employment that is continuing to erode slack in the labour market,"" Capital Economics said. Hargreaves Lansdown senior economist Ben Brettell said it appeared that the ""willingness of the MPC to 'look through' higher inflation and leave rates on hold is wearing thin, and if inflation continues to surprise we could see higher rates by the end of the summer"". Sterling, which had been trading below $1.27 before the minutes were released, surged to almost $1.28 in response, while the FTSE 100 share index was down more than 1%.  In the minutes of its meeting, the MPC said the ""driving force"" behind the recent pickup in inflation had remained the depreciation of sterling that followed the Brexit vote in June last year. However, it added that a ""number of indicators of domestically generated inflationary pressure"" had also increased in recent months.   The committee said inflation could exceed 3% by the autumn and was expected to remain above the 2% target for an ""extended period"" as the weaker pound pushed up prices while pay growth remained ""subdued"". The three MPC members who voted to raise rates were swayed by the inflation fears, and also took into account growth in ""business investment and net trade"" which appear ""on track"" to compensate for weaker consumption. They also thought that interest rates would still leave monetary policy ""very supportive"". However, the five committee members who voted to leave rates unchanged took into account the recent slowdown in consumer spending and economic growth as a whole. They said ""it was too early to judge with confidence how large and persistent"", that would be.   ""It is as yet unclear to what degree weaker consumption would be offset by other components of demand"". the minutes said.  While different members of the MPC placed different weights on these arguments, the minutes said that ""all committee members agreed that any increases in Bank Rate would be expected to be at a gradual pace and to a limited extent"". Kallum Pickering, senior UK economist at Berenberg, said: ""This gradual shift in stance represents the MPC's efforts to foretell and communicate a forthcoming hike. Don't ignore it."" However, other economists said it could still be some time before the Bank votes to rise rates. ""It is far from certain that interest rates will rise in the near term,"" said Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club. ""There is the potential for the balance of views to alter, with the imminent changes in the MPC's membership. Kristin Forbes who has been a strong advocate of raising interest rates is now leaving the MPC, while another member is due to appointed as the committee is currently one short."" "
Hawkish,Dawlish underpass shut for railway sea wall work,2024-09-25,2022-06-13,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-61786123,"An underpass in a Devon town has been closed for work on a sea wall to protect a railway line from storms and rising sea levels, engineers have said. The Colonnade underpass in Dawlish was being shut for up to 12 weeks to build foundations for a new bridge, Network Rail said. Access to the beach and promenade would be limited over the summer. Bosses said it was also part of the final phase of construction of a sea wall which would protect the town too. Network Rail said safety was its priority and the closure was needed because engineers would be operating large and heavy machinery to install 66ft (20m) long foundations.  It added ""every effort will be made to complete this work sooner"". Rob Breckon, of the rail track operator, said it was realised ""there was no good time"" to do work, particularly during the summer. But he added that delaying it until after summer was not possible due to the extreme weather the local coastline could experience.  The new bridge will connect the two sections of a new accessible public promenade and house a culvert to allow the Dawlish Water stream to flow into the sea, managers said. The work is being carried out after the track was washed away by the sea when it was hit by huge waves. Most of Devon and Cornwall was without a railway line to the rest of the country for several weeks after the storm between 4 and 5 February 2014. Network Rail said the entire £80m line protection scheme was due to be completed in 2023 and would protect the railway for 100 years. Follow BBC News South West on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

Hawkish,'I made space for Stephen Hawking',2024-09-25,2018-03-14,By Helen Burchell and Phil Shepka,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-43399171,"As the world mourns the death of Stephen Hawking, in Cambridge - where he lived and worked - people remember a familiar face often spotted on the streets and in the university's halls. In the wake of the news, the mood in the city was not so much sombre, as one in which many recalled a visionary who had touched the lives of residents, students and academics. From ""I spotted him once in the pub"", to ""I've heard some of his inspirational talks"", the scientist was synonymous with the city, which bears the mark of his legacy.  A bust in his likeness sits in Cambridge University's Centre for Theoretical Cosmology and the Stephen Hawking Building was named after Gonville and Caius College's most celebrated fellow. Outside the very site which housed his accommodation when he joined as a PhD student in 1962 is a simple sign announcing his death.  Countless passers-by stop on their way to work, or to the shops, and pause to read it. ""His work is a testament to human determination,"" says history student Maddy Ducharme. Her thoughts echo many of those who have lined up to sign a book of condolence opened by the college. Some of those now studying at the university were inspired to study science by the professor, including physics student Arno Liu. ""When I was 12 my mum bought me A Brief History of Time.  ""He wrote it in a very humorous way which kept me focused on the ideas he had. He was one of the reasons I got dragged into physics."" Obituary: Stephen Hawking  Stephen Hawking: A life in pictures China's love for the late Stephen Hawking The 17-year-old was one of those who queued to sign the book of condolence. ""I quoted a Dylan Thomas poem, Do Not Go Gentle into that Good Night. It's written for people not to give up, but to fight on in life."" Although he had not met the professor, Mr Liu was among those who attended Prof Hawking's 75th birthday celebrations at Gonville and Caius last year. ""Everybody was trying to chat with him but seeing him was enough for me,"" he adds. Caius' law student Amy Edwards-Knight, 21, was also there and remembers a ""gorgeous piece of music"" which had been composed to mark the occasion. ""They had the choir perform and he gave a really lovely speech. ""He talked about what Caius had done for him, and his connections to the college, and waxed lyrical about the abilities of really understanding the universe and how he didn't think that he ultimately ever did, completely."" ""I sat pretty close to him in the hall,"" adds Evan Adair, a 21-year-old student at the college. ""For me it was special. I'm a historian - I'm not a scientist - but I know that he's made a really big contribution to the way that we understand the world today."" Despite his failing health the professor still attended dinners in the college, and Caius' bar worker Jesus Gorjon remembers being asked to make room for a certain guest on one occasion. ""I was doing a dinner at the college and my boss told me to make some space for 'Stephen' and I said 'OK'.  ""I didn't know who 'Stephen' was, but when I saw it was him, I was like, 'oh, I've made some space for Stephen Hawking'."" The professor also surprised TV actor Stephen McGann, who ran into him at Antonio Carluccio's restaurant in Cambridge. Paying tribute on Twitter, the Call the Midwife star said: ""To anybody who lives in or near Cambridge, Stephen Hawking was a constant reminder of brilliance that wants to share the same air.  ""You would come across him in the street - in cafes or shops. I last saw him at the next table in Carluccio's. I'll miss that."" As people mourn the passing of the man whom many held in awe, those in his home city are fondly remembering a familiar man about town. Several recall  ""coming across"" the scientist in the street. ""He ran over my foot years ago on King's Parade,"" one wrote on Twitter. Another replied: ""I can top that - I nearly crashed into him on my bike."" But Ms Ducharme sums it up for many when she says: ""Professor Hawking showed such inspiration, such determination. ""We're all so lucky to have lived at the same time he did, and to live in Cambridge at the same time he did."""

Hawkish,Davidson named on Time influence list,2024-09-25,2018-04-19,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-43822459,"Scottish Conservative party leader Ruth Davidson has been named by Time magazine on its annual list of the world's most influential people. The US magazine and website says the Time 100 is not a measure of power but a recognition of individuals ""whose time is now"".  The 100 also includes world figures such as US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Other Brits include Prince Harry and London Mayor Sadiq Khan. The list is split into pioneers, leaders, titans, artists and icons. Ms Davidson is chosen as a pioneer, alongside US comedian Tiffany Haddish and snowboarder Chloe Kim. Scottish historian Niall Ferguson, a senior fellow at Stanford's Hoover Institution, writes in the magazine that the Conservative Party looked as ""dead as a dodo in Scotland"" and owes much of its resurrection to Ms Davidson's ""refreshing, rambunctious style"". The 39-year-old Edinburgh-born politician worked as a BBC journalist before entering politics in 2009.  Just two years later, she was elected the Scottish Conservatives' leader.  She has since opposed Scottish independence and Brexit as well as presiding over a revival in the fortunes of the party in Scotland. Ferguson also said Ms Davidson ""stood out"" as a proponent of same-sex marriage. A spokesman for the Scottish Conservatives said: ""Ruth's extremely honoured to be included on such a list. ""And while she's flattered to receive an accolade from across the Atlantic, her full focus remains on her job here in Scotland."" Ms Davidson is one of a record 45 people on this list under the age of 40. At just 14, British actress Millie Bobby Brown, star of Netflix drama Stranger Things, is the youngest ever to make the list. Meanwhile, former US President Barack Obama, who has said that his greatest frustration as president was the failure of commonsense gun-safety laws, nominates the Parkland, Florida, teenagers who organized the March for Our Lives."

Hawkish,'No progress' on Hawking memorial plans,2024-09-25,2019-03-14,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-47537266,"Plans for a public memorial to Prof Stephen Hawking in Cambridge are no further forward a year after his death, a councillor has said. The renowned physicist died aged 76 after a long battle with motor neurone disease on 14 March last year. Cambridge City Council unanimously passed a motion in April to create a permanent tribute to Prof Hawking. But councillor Rod Cantrill said he had seen ""no evidence"" of progress a year on ""after making a public commitment"". Council leader Lewis Herbert said a ""few options"" were still on the table. Ideas include the installation of a free public telescope, a black hole sculpture at the Guildhall or naming the proposed railway station at Addenbrooke's after him.    Liberal Democrat councillor Mr Cantrill said naming one of the city's public parks after Prof Hawking would be a fitting tribute. He said: ""At the time I made it clear that we need to do something to mark Prof Hawking's contribution, not just to the university and the city but to the world of science. ""He made very complex science accessible to the person on the street."" Prof Paul Shellard, director of the Stephen Hawking Centre for Theoretical Cosmology in Cambridge, said it was important to ""establish in perpetuity his legacy"" in the city. ""It was a great privilege to observe his courage and determination and the good humour with which he faced the many challenges of his own life,"" he said. Mr Herbert said discussions were taking place between the council, Cambridge University and Gonville and Caius College over what form a permanent memorial would take. A memorial flagstone was installed in September in a private ceremony outside the late scientist's room in Caius Court. In June, the scientist's ashes were interred in Westminster Abbey following a public memorial service which celebrated his life."

Four appliances were called to the incident which was reported at about 17:20 BST said Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service. The cause was traced to coolant which created smoke after it leaked onto an exhaust pipe said the fire service.

Hawkish,Phone snaps aim to track coastal erosion,2024-09-25,2020-10-01,By Amy Gladwell,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-54286738,"Hundreds of beachgoers' smartphone photos are being gathered to track the impact of rising sea levels and climate change. About 10 mobile phone mounts are being installed at key points across south-west England, for people to take pictures then upload them to a website. The data, gathered by Plymouth Coastal Observatory (PCO), will be used to help authorities shape beach management. It was a ""fantastic idea"" to engage people, the Environment Agency said. Dawlish Warren in Devon, Porthmeor in St Ives, Cornwall, and West Bay in Dorset are among those to have the mounts. The Environment Agency has secured funding from the South West Regional Flood and Coastal Committee for the CoastSnap project, which was inspired by a successful scheme in New South Wales, Australia, PCO said. It aims to collect photos taken across varying tidal stages, linking beach erosion to weather conditions, the seasons and storms. Joseff Saunders, Coastal Process Scientist from PCO, said: ""Coastal erosion is a very real problem and it is going to become more apparent going forward."" He said seven phone stations had been put in place in 2020 after a pilot in 2019 and two to three more should be installed before the winter.  ""It just exploded this summer after lockdown. Lots of people were out and about and we were getting upwards of 30 to 40 photos submitted a day. A couple of weeks ago we passed the 1,000 mark,"" he said. An Environment Agency spokesman said: ""We hope the data gained through CoastSnap will help us see how sea level rise and climate change are starting to impact our coast, and that they will enable us to make appropriate decisions about how to respond to these pressures in the future."" More stations are due to follow."
Hawkish,Photos show 'silent drama' of winter walks,2024-09-25,2019-12-24,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-gloucestershire-50742373,"Photographer Quintin Lake is well on the way to completing the impressive feat of walking around the British coastline. Over the past five years the Cheltenham-based adventurer has been hiking the route in sections, and is due to finish next summer. On the way he takes pictures and sells the prints to help fund the self-supported project. He said winter was ""the most beautiful time of the year"". Mr Lake said at this time of year his daily walking routine meant he began before dawn and ended after dusk, so he got to see ""the sun rise and set followed by the moon rise and the stars emerge"". ""The silent drama of these happenings is accentuated when reflected in the sea and I often see and feel the visceral effect of the moon on the tide,"" he said. Mr Lake began his mammoth 11,000 km (7,000 mile) trek in April 2015 in London and has been hoping to finish in June 2020. He said the aim of the project was artistic"". ""I want to get a better understanding of the mystery and beauty of the British landscape and convey that through photography."" When he is not walking he returns to his home in Cheltenham, where he works as an architectural photographer. He walks 15-25 miles (25-40 km) each day, and takes photographs for about three hours. ""As I don't have a support team and much of the coast, especially in Scotland, is far from roads and facilities, I mostly wild camp,"" he said. ""Along with a tent I carry food, fuel and batteries so I can be self-sufficient for five days at a time which equates to around 20kg on my back."" ""I don't take ferries but instead cross at the first bridge across rivers and estuaries,"" he said. ""So in England and Wales, this is mostly on marked trails but in Scotland (which is approximately half the length) it's an entirely different proposition, as much of the walking is off-trail and often in very rough and remote mountainous terrain in the North West."" He tries to stay ""as close to the coast while staying safe"".  He walks in sections of up to six weeks at a time before returning home for a month or two.  Since he began his walk he has sustained two injuries - a split tendon in his foot and a stress injury in his shin - both which required a couple of months rest to recover.  Mr Lake said he ""enjoys the focus of mind"" when long-distance walking in winter. ""As there are so few hours of daylight, one has to be moving from dawn to dusk to be able to cover the distance.   ""The low sun angle of winter light and the resulting high tonal range create unique photographic challenges and opportunities."" All photographs by Quintin Lake."
Hawkish,Joe Sugg gives YouTubers hope for TV success,2024-09-25,2019-02-17,By Daniel Rosney,https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-47266811,"Joe Sugg says his success on Strictly Come Dancing has given other YouTubers hope of having successful TV careers. The 27-year-old made it to the final of the show in December, losing to Stacey Dooley. Speaking at a conference for vloggers this weekend, Joe said his appearance ""was beneficial for the whole of social media"". He previously said he hoped going on Strictly would ""build a relationship"" between vloggers and broadcasters. Joe was speaking at VidCon London. But that transition from social media to telly is not one all are capable of making. ""They need help,"" Lucy Loveridge told Radio 1 Newsbeat at the convention. Lucy's the head of talent at Gleam Futures - the UK's largest agency for online stars. ""They've been in their bedroom [vlogging] and need a bit of coaching,"" she explains. ""That investment is necessary."" Recently there's been an increase in traditional media booking online stars: Zoe Sugg (Joe's sister) took part in The Great British Bake Off for Comic Relief and Trisha Paytas appeared on Celebrity Big Brother. BBC Radio 5 live also hosted commentary of the boxing match between YouTubers Logal Paul and KSI.  Holly Horne, who has more than 13m followers on social media app TikTok, says she's starting to be approached more by execs.  ""Life is starting to get crazy,"" she explains. ""Since I've blown up over the past few months there's been offers and I've said yes to everything."" The 22-year-old from Guernsey, known online as HollyH, posts comedy lip syncs and is the most followed Brit on the platform.  ""I've had a couple of meetings over the past few days which have been insane,"" she tells Newsbeat.  When asked if she'll be taking part in this year's Strictly Come Dancing, Holly smiles and says: ""Joe Sugg's manager is my manager so crazy stuff is going to happen."" Holly also said she'd like to move into movies and is working on a CBBC series. It's the same on the other side of the Atlantic too. ""We're getting opportunities because of YouTube,"" the Merrell Twins tell Newsbeat.  The 22-year-old sisters post comedy sketches and music covers to their four million subscribers.  ""I'm not trying to brag but it's crazy the numbers we can bring,"" Veronica explains. ""Traditional media see the influence we have and want to get viewers."" ""Because of YouTube"" they've just landed a role in upcoming comedy film Limited Partners starring Salma Hayek and Tiffany Haddish. ""It gave us validation for the role because of the success our channel."" Younger audiences spend more time online than they do watching TV or films, with only 10% of young people getting ""almost all"" their TV programmes through a TV screen. But, as Lucy Loveridge explains, there's a limit to what online stars can bring to TV.  ""There's no T4 anymore and that was such a testing ground for finding and developing new talent."" Riyadh Khalaf, a YouTuber who's made documentaries for BBC Three and hosts a podcast for Radio 1, says: ""I only went on YouTube because I couldn't get a job on TV."" He says TV execs started to take notice when online sites started writing about him but ""they didn't know where to put me.""  ""We are now proving to traditional media that if you develop us and train us we can be just as good as Davina McCall, Alan Carr or Graham Norton. ""There's a real democracy of talent, which is great."" Follow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.

Hawkish,Minister opens station and unveils sea wall plaque,2024-09-25,2023-07-03,Jonathan Morris,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0384pvz1m3o,"Secretary of State for Transport Mark Harper has opened a new railway station at Marsh Barton in Exeter. The £16m station should have been up and running in 2022, but the project faced issues with building supplies and bad weather.  He also unveiled a plaque in Dawlish to mark the completion of the sea wall.   The £82m project aims to protect the line from extreme weather after the track was destroyed by storms in 2014. The station at Marsh Barton includes a new pedestrian and cycle bridge which opened in April. It will be served by hourly Great Western Railway services from Tuesday between Paignton and Exmouth, with half-hourly services at peak times. Devon County Councillor Andrea Davis, cabinet member for climate change, environment and transport, said: ""Today's a fantastic day.  ""There have been challenges getting to this point.  ""But what we've got now is this amazing station, which is available for the residents of the south west to get into Exeter; great connectivity for Marsh Barton Trading Estate, the hospital and the county council.  ""We are really delighted this day has come."" It follows the opening of new stations at Newcourt and Cranbrook, as well as the opening of the Dartmoor Line between Exeter and Okehampton. In February 2014, rail passengers to and from Cornwall and most of Devon were left without a connection to the national network after the storms left the line at Dawlish dangling in the air. The line was reopened two months later and was followed by major work on the sea wall. The work at Dawlish includes a new promenade and Network Rail is building a new footbridge with lifts at Dawlish Station.  Further cliff protection work including a rockfall shelter at Holcombe, along the coast from Dawlish, is continuing.  Michelle Handforth, regional managing director of Network Rail’s Wales and Western Region, said the sea wall would ""protect the railway line and town of Dawlish for generations to come"". Mr Harper said he was ""delighted"" at the ""completion of two major projects"" which he said were on a ""vital rail route for passengers in the South West"".

Hawkish,11 TV series to watch this July,2024-09-25,2023-07-04,Caryn James,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20230702-11-of-the-best-tv-shows-to-watch-this-july,"Caryn James picks out the biggest offerings – from Taylor Sheridan's spy thriller Special Ops: Lioness, with Zoe Saldana and Nicole Kidman, to the comebacks of classic series Futurama and Justified. 1. The Horror of Dolores Roach Is Dolores horrified or is she the horror? Maybe both in this dramedy, the latest to jump on the trend of podcasts turned into television series. Justina Machado (One Day at a Time) is the title character, recently released after a 16-year-prison stint, who returns to her now-gentrifying New York City neighbourhood. Her shady old friend gives her a place to stay and a massage table, but if you've ever heard a murder podcast you'll know that her new life won't go smoothly and her nickname of Magic Hands will only get her so far. If the title weren't clue enough, the series is produced by the horror masters at Blumhouse, and is being described as ""Sweeney Todd-inspired"". Yum? The Horror of Dolores Roach premieres on 7 July on Prime Video 2. The Afterparty Season 2 of the slyly comic whodunnit series brings back Tiffany Haddish and Sam Richardson as detectives who can't seem to agree on anything, with a new cast of murder suspects and a new crime. The format, a delight for movie lovers, is the same: each episode is told from a different character's point of view, in a different cinematic style, this time ranging from noir to 19th-Century costume drama, and apparently including a take on Wes Anderson's The Royal Tenenbaums. When a bridegroom is killed – worst wedding ever – everyone at the ceremony is a suspect, including the bride, her family and their friends, played by John Cho, Paul Walter Hauser, Ken Jeong, Elizabeth Perkins and Zach Woods. The Afterparty premieres on 12 July on AppleTV+ 3. Full Circle  Steven Soderbergh never takes a breath. He has tended to direct at least one film or streaming series a year recently, from 2019's underrated High Flying Bird to this year's best forgotten Magic Mike's Last Dance. Some of his strongest work has been in television drama, notably The Knick, and his latest is a crime series full of promise, suspense and first-rate actors, including Claire Danes, Timothy Olyphant, Zazie Beetz and Jharrel Jerome. Danes and Olyphant play a couple who receive a call that their son has been kidnapped, and Beetz investigates, turning up family secrets involving crime, cash and the country of Guyana. Full Circle premieres on 13 July on Max   4. Survival of The Thickest The very funny comic actress and stand-up Michelle Buteau is familiar as the what's-her-name best friend in films including Always Be My Maybe and Marry Me with Jennifer Lopez, and as part of the ensemble on BET's First Wives Club. She gets the starring role here in a series she has created, loosely based on her book of comic essays, also called Survival Of The Thickest. Her fictional character, Mavis Beaumont, leaves her cheating partner when she finds him with another woman. Single at age 38, she tries to restart her romantic life and jumpstart her career. She may not make the best choices, however, as is evident in the fact that she is a fashion-challenged stylist. Survival of The Thickest premieres on 13 July on Netflix 5. Justified: City Primeval Proving the theory that nothing on television has to stay dead forever, the beloved 2010-15 crime series Justified, based on Elmore Leonard's stories about US Deputy Marshal Raylan Givens, has been rebooted with new locations. Timothy Olyphant (pictured) is the constant as Givens, who has the same swagger and same Western hat as in the original series. Now Givens has moved from Kentucky to Florida, and is taking his feisty 15-year-old daughter (Olyphant's real daughter, Vivian Olyphant) to camp when some thugs get in their way. Raylan and daughter end up in Detroit, where he has to track down a killer known as the Oklahoma Wildman. Inspired by Leonard's 1980 novel City Primeval: High Noon in Detroit, the new location adds urban grit to Givens; Western dynamic, a smart way to reinvigorate a familiar show. Justified: City Primeval premieres 18 July on FX and 19 July on Hulu   6. Praise Petey After so many serious exposés of cults, the time seems right for an animated comedy on the subject. Anna Drezen, a former head writer on Saturday Night Live, has created this series, which puts an absurdist spin on the old fish-out-of-water and woman-starting-over stories. Petey, voiced by Schitt's Creek star Annie Murphy, is a cosmopolitan New Yorker who takes over her father's small-town cult after her city life falls apart. John Cho is the voice of cult member and possible romantic interest Bandit, who was raised in the organisation. Stephen Root, so chilling and ruthless as hitman handler Monroe Fuches in the later seasons of Barry, is Petey's father, and Christine Baranski is her sophisticated, non-cult-following mother. Praise Petey premieres 21 July on Freeform 7. Special Ops: Lioness  Far from the ranches of Yellowstone and 1923, prolific showrunner Taylor Sheridan takes on the CIA in his latest series, set in the world of counterterrorism. The title refers to his fictionalised version of a CIA programme. Zoe Saldana stars as Joe, the head of a team (like Carrie in Homeland). She sends an agent, Cruz Manuelos (Laysla De Oliveira) undercover to get close to the daughter of a suspected terrorist, so the CIA can, as Joe says in the trailer, ""kill the target"". Nicole Kidman has a supporting role as a CIA supervisor, and Morgan Freeman is the US Secretary of State. Intrigue and suspense should drive the plots, but Sheridan-watchers will be looking for the subtext too. Sheridan has always said his shows have no political slant, while many commentators see a conservative streak. It will be fascinating to see what the series might say about US policy and terrorism. Special Ops: Lioness premieres 23 July on Paramount+ 8. Futurama After 10 years away, the long-running animated sci-fi satire returns with new stories and the same off-the-wall characters. In the original, Fry (Billy West) was cryogenically frozen in 1999, only to thaw out in the year 3000, where he met the love of his life, Cyclops Leela (Katy Sagal), and the robot Bender (John DiMaggio), among other eccentrics. The new episodes pick up 23 years later, with an updated spin on social trends. A newsreader reports on a recently discovered virus, Explovid-23, which can be tested for with a gigantic cotton swab up your nose. A banner at an outdoor event says ""Back-to-Normal Fest 2021"", with 2021 crossed out and 3023 hand-written in. The series was created by Matt Groening of Simpsons fame – and a family resemblance can be seen in the character's wide-jawed faces, and humour that is both skewering and silly. Futurama premieres 24 July on Hulu 9. Dark Winds  One of television's best under-the-radar series returns for a second season, with Zahn McClarnon (Reservation Dogs and Fargo) as Lt. Joe Leaphorn of the Navajo Police. Based on Tony Hillerman's crime novels set in the US South West during the 1970s, the first season revealed that Joe's son had been killed in a suspicious oil drilling explosion. The new series has him tracking the man he suspects of causing the tragedy. Joining him is Sgt Bernadette Manuelito (Jessica Matten) and his former partner Jim Chee (Kiowa Gordon), now a private detective. McClarnon makes Leaphorn an iconic figure, a Native American update on the Western hero, tough, wise and not necessarily beyond taking revenge. Dark Winds' executive producers include Robert Redford and George RR Martin, but it stands on its own as taut, atmospheric and deeply humane, with the texture of life on the reservation and the vast desert landscape vital parts of the show. Dark Winds premieres 27 July on AMC+ and 30 July on AMC 10. Twisted Metal Following recent HBO hit The Last of Us, here comes another video-game adaptation set in a post-apocalyptic world. Anthony Mackie, best known as Falcon (and soon to be Captain America) in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, is at the centre of this action comedy inspired by the PlayStation title, a demolition derby with lethal weapons. Mackie plays John Doe, who has amnesia, and agrees to deliver a mysterious package. He loads his gun, gets in his beat-up car and races off across the US. Stephanie Beatriz plays a car thief named Quiet, Thomas Haden Church is the villainous highway patrolman Agent Stone, while Sweet Tooth, a demented killer clown, is played physically by the wrestler Joe Seanoa (Samoa Joe) with Will Arnett's voice. The game has been around since 1995, with various further instalments appearing over the years, so the series has a built-in fan base. Twisted Metal premieres 27 July on Peacock 11. Good Omens This odd-couple comic fantasy, based on the novel by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman, continues for another season, with Michael Sheen as the fussy angel Aziraphale and David Tennant as the brash, anything-goes demon Crowley. Last time they saved the world from the Antichrist. This time their comfy London life is interrupted when they team up to get the angel Gabriel out of trouble after he vanishes from heaven and pops up at Aziraphale's bookshop. Jon Hamm returns as the often befuddled Gabriel, who Gaiman has called ""everyone's worst boss"". For all its religious and spiritual allusions, Good Omens is the most light-hearted of all the Gaiman adaptations (Netflix's The Sandman and Amazon Prime's American Gods among them), which makes it the most fun.

Hawkish,Is Trump losing the China trade war?,2024-09-25,2018-05-22,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44201751,"Donald Trump once claimed a trade war with China would be ""easy"" to win. But consensus is emerging that the president is losing the first battles. His team has been trying to hash out a deal to boost US exports, but multiple rounds of negotiations have yet to yield progress on key priorities, like protection for US intellectual property. Now the conflict has Mr Trump taking fire at home from two sides: those worried he is provoking a damaging trade fight, and those who fear he will give in too easily. Mr Trump, citing a large trade deficit and unfair rules in China, says the US is starting from such a bad position that the country stands to gain no matter what happens. But amid the sound and fury, what, if anything, is actually changing? The US last month barred Chinese technology firm ZTE from receiving US exports after the firm failed to comply with a settlement reached after it violated sanctions against North Korea and Iran. Mr Trump, at the request of Chinese President Xi Jinping, said the US would take another look at the penalties. The measures have forced the firm, which relies on US parts to make smart phones and network equipment, to suspend major operations. The two sides are still discussing details, but instead of the ban, the firm is likely to face fines and be required to shake up its ownership. The potential reprieve has prompted critics, including some members of his own party, to accuse Mr Trump of caving in to a company that has raised national security concerns.  Some also alleged suspicious timing, pointing to a deal struck between a Chinese-owned company and one of the Trump Organization's business partners in Indonesia. US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Monday denied a quid pro quo and maintained that ZTE discussions are separate from trade talks. He said the punishment was never intended to put the company out of business. While the administration assured that any revised penalty would remain harsh, some politicians said they were considering congressional action to block a reversal.  The backlash has nettled the president, who prides himself on his negotiating skills. He took to Twitter to defend his action. Bottom line: The situation remains fluid but the president has paid a political cost for his willingness to spare ZTE. The US treasury secretary said new tariffs are on hold, while negotiators work out a deal, in which China would purchase more American agriculture and energy products.  Mr Trump on Monday said the potential agreement could be ""one of the best things"" to happen to farmers, an important part of his base that has been worried about Chinese retaliation. But analysts noted that the joint statement issued at the end of the most recent round of negotiations did not include a target for the increased purchases, despite earlier US claims the increase could amount to as much as $200bn. They say China's growth would necessitate increased purchases regardless of trade talks.   Meanwhile, China made few concessions to the US concerns about intellectual property theft and government subsidies that triggered the stand-off. US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, who is viewed as being more of a hardliner on China than Mr Mnuchin, and others in the administration have reserved the right to return to tariffs, depending on how the talks go.   Existing sanctions, including US tariffs on steel and aluminium and Chinese tariffs on US products such as wine, remain in effect.  The tensions within the administration had erupted at earlier talks in Beijing in a widely reported a shouting match between Mr Mnuchin and a more hawkish adviser, Peter Navarro. But while American officials played a good cop-bad cop routine and continued to debate amongst themselves, the Chinese media claimed victory.  ""In the face of Washington's unreasonable pre-conditions in earlier consultations, Beijing had always returned with resolute responses and had never backed down,"" one commentary on China's official media Xinhua read. Bottom line: The tariff dispute remains primarily a war of words - and one the Chinese appear to be winning. China last year said it intends to ease restrictions on foreign ownership of financial companies. This spring, regulators said they would relax rules for auto and aircraft makers as well. On Tuesday, China's Ministry of Finance announced a plan to cut taxes from 25% to 15% for most foreign cars starting July 1, among other measures. Improved access to the Chinese market is a key demand of US negotiators, who say Chinese rules put international firms at a disadvantage. Some companies, such as JP Morgan Chase and Tesla, have already said they are planning to take advantage of the shift. But China, which is worried about the health of its financial sector, started to discuss its intentions last year, before the tensions heated up this spring. Previous promises of openness have disappointed.  Bottom line: China appears to be willing to open up certain markets, responding to domestic concerns. Details remain in the works.  The US-China trade dispute has never been just about trade - the White House also wants China's help to curb North Korea and its nuclear ambitions. The US launched its probe of Chinese intellectual property practices last summer amid frustration about a series of missile launches. The president is now planning a summit with North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un in June, though North Korea has threatened to cancel. Mr Trump has suggested North Korea's shift was due to Chinese influence, linking the two sets of talks. Democrat Max Baucus is among those who have said yielding on trade in hope of help with North Korea is a risky strategy. Bottom line: It's not clear how the North Korea efforts will evolve."

Hawkish,Farm death accused had 'blood over hands',2024-09-25,2018-10-30,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-46033489,"A farmer was found with blood over his hands and arms after a woman died when her hair and clothing became trapped in a milling machine, a court has heard. Lauren Scott, 20, suffered fatal injuries from a rotating shaft on a farm near Dawlish in Devon in 2017. Farmer and land-owner Neil Carpenter, who found her after the incident, said there had been a bang, her brother James Scott told Exeter Crown Court. Mr Carpenter, 45, from Dawlish, denies manslaughter by gross negligence. Ms Scott, who was volunteering on the 10-acre smallholding, died at the scene from multiple injuries. Her hair and clothes were caught in a power take-off (PTO) shaft attached to the pre-World War Two milling machine and a tractor in the incident in a barn on Springfield Farm on 4 March, the court was told. On the day she died, Mr Scott and other family members went to the smallholding and said Mr Carpenter ""had blood all over his hands and up his arms"".  ""I asked him what happened but didn't really get an answer. He said there was a bang,"" he said. Mr Carpenter called 999 after he found her, the court was told. Mr Scott told the court his ""bit of a tomboy"" sister was a ""mechanically-minded girl"" who had grown up around machinery. Their father, Gary Hooper, a mechanic was ""very strict"" in warning his children about the dangers of such equipment and her knowledge of farm safety was good, he added. The court has heard the ""dangerous"" shaft, which caused ""catastrophic"" injuries, should have been fully covered but was exposed in places. Parking warden and part-time farmer Mr Carpenter has admitted two health and safety breaches in connection with Ms Scott and two other volunteer workers in 2015. The trial continues."
Hawkish,Ceasefire begins in Yemen to help combat virus,2024-09-25,2020-04-08,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-52224358,"A unilateral two-week ceasefire called by the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen has come into effect.  The coalition said it wanted to support UN efforts for a political solution and help stop coronavirus spread, though no cases have been reported in Yemen. UN Secretary General António Guterres welcomed the move.  But a senior official in the rebel Houthi movement, which is battling pro-government forces backed by the coalition, called it a ""ploy"". Hours after the coalition's ceasefire announcement on Wednesday night, both sides accused one another of having launched attacks. The five-year conflict has devastated Yemen, reportedly killed more than 100,000 people, and triggered what the UN considers the world's worst humanitarian crisis. Spokesman Col Turki al-Malki announced that the coalition would begin a ceasefire at midday local time (10:00 GMT) on Thursday because it was ""determined to create a conducive environment for the UN envoy's [peace] efforts, and to alleviate the suffering of the brotherly people of Yemen and support the efforts towards combating the spread of Covid-19 pandemic"". He added that the two-week period could be extended to ""allow for appropriate conditions"" for the warring parties to discuss the UN envoy's ""proposals on steps and mechanisms to implement a permanent ceasefire in Yemen"" and ""a comprehensive political solution in Yemen"". The UN secretary general and his envoy, Martin Griffiths, welcomed the initiative.  ""I now call upon the government of Yemen and [the Houthis] to follow through on their commitment to immediately cease hostilities. I also call on the government and the Houthis to engage with each other, in good faith and without preconditions,"" Mr Guterres said.  ""Only through dialogue will the parties be able to agree on a mechanism for sustaining a nationwide ceasefire, humanitarian and economic confidence-building measures to alleviate the suffering of the Yemeni people, and the resumption of the political process to reach a comprehensive settlement to end the conflict."" This is Saudi Arabia's most significant move to try to find a way out of its costly military campaign in Yemen.  The coalition statement suggests its unilateral ceasefire was sparked by the very real threat posed by the coronavirus in a country whose health system is barely functioning.  But another wake-up call dates back to last September when the Kingdom's vital oil facilities came under fire in a spectacular attack blamed on Iran.  Saudi Arabia shifted gear, embarking on secret talks with senior Houthi officials to secure their border, end Houthi missile strikes on its territory, and try to pull them away from Iran.  But in recent months, Houthi forces have kept advancing militarily, encouraging more hawkish Houthi elements.  Sources say senior Houthi leaders support a negotiated end to this war. But they're also digging in.  Even if UN talks begin, it will be a long time before they end with the political solution Yemen desperately needs.  Mohammed al-Bukhaiti, a senior member of the Houthi movement's Political Bureau, told Al-Mayadeen TV before the ceasefire began that the rebels wanted ""a complete cessation of the war and the lifting of the siege once and for all"". ""If any ceasefire does not include the removal of the siege on Yemen, that would be the continuation of the Saudi war,"" he said, referring to the coalition's de facto blockade of rebel-held Yemen. ""The aggression's [coalition] move to announce a ceasefire was just another ploy,"" he added. Houthi spokesman Mohammed Abdulsalam tweeted that the rebels had sent the UN a comprehensive proposal that would ""lay the foundations for a political dialogue and a transitional period"". Houthi-run Al-Masirah TV reported that shortly after the ceasefire announcement the coalition warplanes struck several positions in Saada, Amran and Bayda provinces. Yemen's information minister meanwhile said that the Houthis launched missiles at Hudaydah and Marib. Yemen has been devastated by a conflict that escalated in March 2015, when the Houthis seized control of much of the west of the country and forced President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi to flee abroad. Alarmed by the rise of a group they believed to be backed militarily by Iran, Saudi Arabia and eight other Arab states began a campaign aimed at restoring Mr Hadi's government. At the start of the war, Saudi officials forecast that it would last only a few weeks. But five years of military stalemate have followed. The UN has verified the deaths of at least 7,500 civilians, with most caused by coalition air strikes. But a monitoring group has estimated that the fighting has killed 112,000 people, including 12,600 civilians. The fighting and blockade have also triggered the world's worst humanitarian crisis.  Some 24 million people - 80% of the population - need humanitarian assistance, and almost 10 million are considered ""one step away from famine""."
Hawkish,Sleeper train service restarts after rail works,2024-09-25,2022-03-22,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-60833988,"A sleeper train which provides a key link between Cornwall, Devon and London is returning to full service, bosses say. The Night Riviera sleeper train was temporarily suspended for eight weeks due to engineering works near Parson's Tunnel in south Devon. It was part of Network Rail's multi-million pound scheme to protect the line between Dawlish and Teignmouth. The service, described as a ""lifeline"" by rail bosses, resumed from 21 March.  James Davis, from GWR, said: ""The service provides a lifeline to people who are trying to get to London, who rely on it to be able to attend business meetings. ""And it's a key part of our tourist armour, helping to transport people both to Devon and Cornwall and back over the summer months."" Part of the work saw Network Rail build a 209m (685ft) long shelter on a stretch of track between Dawlish and Holcombe, which aims to improve protection from falling rocks. The rail company added the ""vital"" work was timed to make sure weekend travel was not affected, as well as ensuring the disruption ended before Easter.

Hawkish,What's eating the Tories?,2024-09-25,2022-10-21,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-63339214,"Soon to have their fifth leader and prime minister in six years, there's something about the Conservative Party that is malfunctioning so badly that it could self-destruct. There could be many reasons, according to your taste. But here are three. There's a problem in the selection process that has led to people rising to the top before it's clear they are capable of leading people, of leading thought, of governing, and of holding the party together. In a parliamentary system, it used to be that you only got to lead a major party after years of learning and honing the many skills required, while proving your ability and fitness for the job to those around you. Not any more.  One theory of leadership and power is that the people who most crave it are often the people who should not be allowed to achieve it. It's a theory with which the Conservative electorate may be unfamiliar. Second, holding the parliamentary party together has become more difficult. Factions have developed, over Europe of course, but also to fight culture wars, to rein back on climate change measures, to represent the working class interests of new, north of England MPs, while ex-ministers exiled from office by incoming prime ministers have questioned why they should stay loyal. It is less united in the background and outlook of its MPs. A culture of deference and discipline has been weakened by decades of rebellion over Europe. That's no bad thing, you might think. The point is that it makes leadership more difficult. Third, this is not just about competing egos. It's about competing visions of where Tories want to take the country and the economy. This was a party that has not grown up around any philosophical base. You could argue that it was based on, if anything, an English or perhaps a British tendency to be wary of ideologies.  Conservatives have been successful as an election-winning machine for nearly two centuries by being pragmatic - by reading the electorate and by doing what it takes to win and hold power. But it has had a sort of ideology bolted on to it. A strand of British nationalism and exceptionalism has become more prominent, and it has bound the party inextricably with Brexit. The battles over Britain's relations with Europe were important to the removal of Margaret Thatcher. John Major's administration was run ragged by what he termed Euro-sceptic ""bastards"". From 13 years of opposition, David Cameron emerged with a message that the party had to be about more than Europe. That didn't last long. In office, he was forced to promise a referendum if he got a majority. He under-estimated the ability of his own party colleagues to mobilise the ""Leave"" vote, losing him that vote and costing him his job. The next three leaders sought to ""Get Brexit Done"", as Boris Johnson summarised it in the 2019 election slogan. In doing so, he expelled party members who continued to fight for a less hardline Brexit deal than the one Theresa May and Johnson favoured. By removing that centre right Remainer tendency, it should have made it easier for Liz Truss to unite the party around a clear vision of where Brexit is taking the UK. Yet it was on those issues that she faltered. The spectacularly botched mini-budget reflected a belief that ""Taking Back Control"" meant the occupants of Downing Street, having secured control of Parliament, were free to do as they wished. The fall-out from that tax-cutting splurge showed that the bond markets and other institutions, including the Bank of England and Office for Budget Responsibility, put constraints on the freedom of manoeuvre even of a post-Brexit prime minister. The ""control"" they took back from Brussels was not as unconstrained as they had thought. And that was before Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng had the opportunity to engage with the inevitable resistance to the ""supply-side"" changes they wanted to make, in de-regulating planning, fracking, employment and environmental rules. As the party of Brexit, the results of leaving the single market and customs union are now challenging Conservatives to define where that decision is to take them and the nation. The impact on the economy from the point of disengagement at the start of 2021 has not been clear because of so many other factors around the pandemic. But we are now seeing a clearer picture emerge of how much less trade Britain does with the European Union, and it has been illuminated in a new report from the Economic and Social Research Institute. Economists there compared Britain's trade performance with other countries as global trade recovered from the worst of the pandemic. Even though there are fewer constraints on goods traffic from the EU to the UK, because Britain has declined to impose the checks it agreed it would, economists found that has fallen by 20%. Goods traffic from the UK to EU has held up better. There are checks, paperwork and delays for trucks crossing the North Sea and Channel, but that is still 16% below where these economists think British trade would be if Brexit had not changed its relations with the EU. Ireland has a different story of increased trade; much less going from Britain across the Irish Sea, but more going the other way, or into Northern Ireland, on a border where there are no barriers to trade. Where, then, does the UK government go to show that Brexit can and will work? To trade deals with other countries, beyond Europe, which we are told have faster-growing economies and will want to improve trade with the UK. These are taking a longer time to secure than Brexiteers had expected. The ones signed off with New Zealand and Australia have met resistance in the UK, for the impact they will probably have on farming, with only modest gains in removing export barriers. A limited deal with India was aimed at sign-off around Diwali - this coming Monday - but that deadline will be missed, and expectations are being lowered. Even if the strategy is successful, these will take years to offset the fall in EU trade. So the new mantra, under Liz Truss, became ""Growth, Growth, Growth"". Since the financial crash in 2008, it's been sluggish. As tax was put up by Rishi Sunak to repair the damage to public finances from that bank crash and from the pandemic, and to prepare for the rising demographic demands for more social care, the party pushed back. The members recoiled at the taunt that taxes, under Rishi Sunak's stewardship, haven't been as high in 70 years. They preferred the glib tax-cutting agenda of his rival. As premier, armed with their mandate, Liz Truss executed a reckless handbrake turn on taxes, in the hope of picking up speed for growth by going in the opposite direction... and crashed. That leaves many questions about how to piece things together again and what follows. Whoever wins the race for Number 10 has to contend with the guy next door. Jeremy Hunt could be the neighbour from hell, because he effectively represents market discipline. While (so far) out of the leadership race, the chancellor gets to make many of the crucial choices in his medium-term fiscal plan on Hallowe'en - due only three days after the new leader is elected. On Friday, he puts his plan to the Office for Budget Responsibility, which judges the effect they can be expected to have on revenues, growth and inflation. It may already be too late for the next prime minister to intervene. Hunt looks like the person placed on the board of a company in financial distress by its main creditor, wielding a veto over anything else the board might decide. If the next leader accepts that Hunt remains Chancellor, he will sit at the Cabinet table as the representative of the bond markets. If the next leader doesn't like him there, the bond markets may respond negatively, unless someone replaces him who is at least as hawkish. The decisions to be made around future budgets are not just for short-term expediency, to get them through the next election. They require Conservatives to decide what path they're on, and what the destination of Brexit is. How big do they want the British state to be? Are they for leaning in to intervene in investment, as Johnson said he would, to help level up the left-behind parts of Britain? Or are they, like Margaret Thatcher, for rolling back the frontiers of the state, and letting the market allocate resources where they can be deployed most efficiently?  Will they honour the pledge, renewed on Wednesday by Liz Truss, to increase the pension by the price inflation rate, now at 10.1%, and at what cost to other spending departments? Will those dependent on welfare benefits lose out in real terms, again? Will they stick with Boris Johnson's expensive pledge on social care, pumping enough money into the system to lower the risk, in England, of having to sell your home if you need to go into a care home? (That spending would feed through to devolved block grants). Will the next leader show much interest in climate change, as Cameron and Johnson did, but May and Truss did not? If they do, what priority will it have? Will they continue with Liz Truss's pledge to boost defence spending by nearly 50%? A vital question is how they wish to use the potential of Brexit to re-shape the economy. Liz Truss was for a free enterprise, de-regulated, low tax economy characterised by helping people at the top to earn lots, and keep more of those earnings, while the benefits ""trickle down"". So long as the economy grows, she was unconcerned with the way in which policy distributed its benefits. She could not acknowledge that a tax giveaway to the highest earners might look unfair, and none of her cabinet seemed to spot that problem until it was too late. Will that approach change? A vital issue where she clashed with her own choice of home secretary was on immigration. Being tough on it, particularly in stopping free movement of Europeans into British jobs, was one of the main planks of the Tory appeal to voters - and successfully so, as Suella Braverman was pointing out. That is one reason why Ms Braverman voiced concerns about the emerging deal with India, which may eventually open up goods trade for British exporters in exchange for work permits in Britain. But in prioritising ""growth, growth, growth"", Liz Truss saw that the obstacles put in the way of recruiting from overseas are holding back the capacity of the British economy to grow. On that much, she was in tune with business lobbies. Apart from inflation, acute recruitment difficulties are widespread. With polls showing lowered post-Brexit public concern about immigration, the 44-day prime minister was for opening the immigration taps a bit more. Real, difficult choices were apparent in this summer's leadership contest. The decision taken by Tory members was to go with the feel-good, low-tax, 21st Century Thatcher. It didn't work. So what are they going to try next?"
Hawkish,Farmer faces jail for 'hair-trap' death,2024-09-25,2018-11-05,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-46100765,"A farmer has been found guilty of causing the death of a 20-year-old woman whose hair became entangled in a milling machine. Lauren Scott was operating the 1940s machine at Springfield Farm near Dawlish, Devon, in March last year. A plastic cover was broken and dented, leaving a rotating shaft exposed, Exeter Crown Court heard. Neil Carpenter, 45, was found guilty of manslaughter by gross negligence and told to expect a jail term. The milling machine had been converted from steam power to run via a drive shaft attached to a tractor. Carpenter claimed he had no idea volunteer worker Miss Scott had been using it until he ""heard a bang"" and found her on the ground near the machine. More news and stories from Devon The farmer, who has also admitted two health and safety offences, will be sentenced on Tuesday. Judge Mr Justice Dingemans said a prison sentence was ""inevitable"". Investigating officer Det Insp Steve Davies, said after the case that Carpenter showed a ""complete disregard"" for safety regulations. ""It all comes down to a £75 cover for the shaft,"" he said. ""He would have known as a farmer that this is a basic requirement for health and safety. ""His approach to health and safety was so flagrant that he wouldn't believe he would need one that would work properly and unfortunately Lauren paid the ultimate price."" Miss Scott's mother Nicola Scott-Hooper told the court it was ""almost impossible to find the words to explain the devastating impact that the death of Lauren has had on myself, her father and our other six children and their families"". She said she was ""privileged"" to be mother of her ""beautiful, amazing and intelligent"" daughter and ""our lives will never be the same""."
Hawkish,Plans to move rail line delayed after consultation,2024-09-25,2020-10-14,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-54538258,"Plans to move a railway line further out to sea to avoid cliff falls have been delayed after an ""unprecedented"" public response to the scheme. Network Rail said it was going to ""take more time to revise the plans"" for the line north of Teignmouth in Devon. The 1.1-mile (1.8km) stretch is vulnerable to damage from rock falls and overtopping waves. Critics said the scheme would result in the loss of about a mile of beach and was ""totally excessive"". Richard Ward, from Save Our Beach, welcomed the decision, saying: ""It is just too grand - there are simpler, cheaper solutions which they can start talking to us about now. ""It is just far too costly and more expensive per km than HS2, and a totally excessive plan from day one and totally unjustified expenditure. A better solution involves rock shelters and some breakwaters.""  Network Rail said more than half of the 1,600 people who responded to the consultation opposed the plans, but ""there was a really strong support for doing something, as doing nothing is not an option"". The main line at nearby Dawlish collapsed and was washed into the sea during storms in February 2014. Work to raise the sea wall at Dawlish stared in June but Network Rail is also looking at ways to protect the line between Holcombe and Teignmouth. Richard Griffith, from the rail operator, said: ""The railway is an absolutely vital artery for the whole of the south west.  ""We have to keep that railway open at all costs. But we also have to consider the impact on the local community and the environment."" Further consultation will take place next year."
Hawkish,Is the Iran nuclear deal finally dead?,2024-09-25,2019-07-07,By Jonathan Marcus,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-48900432,"Is the Iran nuclear deal dying by a thousand cuts, or is it actually dead already and nobody will quite admit it? The United States abandoned the agreement just over a year ago. Iran is now progressively breaching its terms, first by storing more low-enriched uranium than it is allowed to hold, and now by upping its enrichment level beyond the 3.67% purity set out in the deal.  It promises to keep breaking additional elements of the agreement until such time as its concerns are met.  The message from Tehran is simple. The Iranians insist that until this month they have been fully complying with the agreement, known as the JCPOA.  That - despite claims to the contrary from the White House - is a view confirmed by the UN's nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).  But the re-imposition of US sanctions means that the Iranian economy is hurting badly. The Iranians say they are not getting the economic benefits of the agreement. And they want the Europeans in some way to relieve the pressure.  The Europeans - essentially Britain, France and Germany - are in a bind, caught between Washington and Tehran.  They want the agreement to continue. They have established - albeit at a ponderous pace - a mechanism for facilitating payments to Tehran for humanitarian goods not covered by the US sanctions.  But this is not enough for Iran. It wants the key sectors of its economy like oil and metals to be relieved from US pressure and that the Europeans cannot do. Their efforts are well-meaning but amount to little more than a diplomatic gambit to show support for the nuclear deal.  It is at the end of the day individual companies that must decide to take the risks and trade with Iran, not governments.  This is the situation that clearly was always going to happen once President Trump walked away from the deal. While the US and its key European allies are at loggerheads over the JCPOA, the reality is that they share many of the same concerns about Iran: its nuclear activities; its missile programmes; and its wider regional behaviour.  The sporadic crisis in the Gulf, with attacks on oil tankers, the shooting down of a US drone and so on, only accentuate these fears.  But two very different strategies - if you can call them that - are in play here.  The initial approach was that of the Obama administration and its allies - along with Russia and China - that brokered the nuclear deal in the first place.  Iran's nuclear programme was proceeding. It may have given up an explicit military dimension, but it had the know-how and the ability to re-start it very quickly.  The aim was, through agreement, to constrain and limit its nuclear activities for a period of time. The agreement was far from perfect, but it was seen at the time as better than no deal. And that is still the view of all of its signatories except the Americans.  The idea was, if you like, to kick the nuclear can down the road; to delay the moment of crisis. (And remember before the nuclear accord was signed there were real fears of a US or Israeli military strike to destroy Iran's nuclear infrastructure). In the meantime it was hoped maybe something would change in Iran. For President Trump the whole deal - President Obama's deal - was anathema. He just wanted out. Instead he is pursuing a policy of ""maximum pressure"" whose goal is unclear.  Some more hawkish voices in his Administration would welcome regime change in Tehran. Others argue that the goal is to force the Iranians to the negotiating table to swallow a new, much more restrictive nuclear deal.  Beyond the US even its allies wonder what is going on in the president's mind. The recently leaked documents from Britain's ambassador to Washington, in which he branded the Trump administration's Iran policy ""incoherent, chaotic"", make this crystal clear. All this of course raises the question, just how many breaches can you have before the document becomes worthless?  Put another way, at what point do you give up pretending that the nuclear deal has a future and start to grapple with the potential consequences of its demise?  The Europeans are struggling to keep the JCPOA alive.  Iran may well have misjudged their capacity to compensate for American pressure.  French President Emmanuel Macron has skilfully down-played Iran's latest breach by announcing a week of consultations to try to get talks renewed between all of the players. The Iranians even say the US can participate in these talks if they lift the sanctions.  But there is probably little to no chance of that.  In setting another 60 day deadline for action Iran is trying to control the pace at which this crisis develops. And it is hard to see what benefit there would be for Tehran to abandon the deal entirely.  However it is hard to see anything much changing. Europe's approach is akin to that illustrated in a well-known British childrens' film where a toy train is hurtling towards the end of the line and one of the characters desperately keeps on placing one more piece of track in its path to avert disaster.  For the Europeans the question is when will the track run out. "

Scott Pengilley, Wales & West Utilities operational manager for the area, said: ""Our engineers have now repaired the leak and made the area safe."" Speaking earlier, resident Ann Morgan said: ""A policeman came and said everybody had to be evacuated. ""They were going round and telling everyone they'd got to get out.""  Mr Pengilley said: ""As a precaution, the emergency services closed Brunswick Place and evacuated nearby properties while we were working.  ""We appreciate that this situation was not ideal, but it was important that we fix this leak now, in order to keep people safe."" Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue service said crews from Dawlish, Teignmouth, Newton Abbot and Middlemoor were also sent to the scene."
Hawkish,Ukrainian teen dies after going missing in Devon,2024-09-25,2023-03-06,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-64864102,"A teenager from Ukraine who went missing in Devon and sparked a search operation has died, police say. Devon and Cornwall Police said the 14-year-old girl, who was a refugee living in the Dawlish area with her mother, was found unconscious on Dawlish beach after the alarm was raised on Saturday. She was airlifted to hospital but later died.  Police said the death was being treated as unexplained and her next of kin had been informed. Officers said the Ukrainian Embassy and the Home Office had also been made aware of the death. Det Insp Becky Davies, of Devon and Cornwall Police, said: ""Localised searches took place with support from the police helicopter and coastguard and an unconscious person was found on Dawlish beach. ""She was subsequently airlifted to the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital, where she later sadly died.  ""This death is currently being treated as unexplained and enquiries continue as to the circumstances surrounding this death.  ""Our thoughts are with the family and friends of the teenage girl at this tragic time."" The force said it was hoped a forensic post-mortem examination would be carried out on Thursday. Officers said they were carrying out house-to-house inquiries and attempting to secure any CCTV or doorbell camera footage as part of the investigation.

Hawkish,What's in US debt ceiling deal and who won?,2024-09-25,2023-05-29,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-65744615,"Congress has approved a deal to raise the government's borrowing limit and prevent a potentially catastrophic default on US debt repayments. The agreement passed the Senate on Thursday, a day after it passed the House of Representatives. Once signed into law by President Joe Biden, it will allow the federal government to borrow money until after the next presidential election in November 2024. Here are the highlights from the package, with analysis by BBC North America correspondent Nomia Iqbal. Every so often, US Congress must vote to raise or suspend the ceiling, so it can borrow more to pay its bills. Currently it is $31.4tn (£25tn). This includes paying for federal employees, the military, Social Security and Medicare, as well as interest on the national debt and tax refunds. But in recent years, this has become increasingly difficult, because the two sides cannot agree on the terms. In the deal that passed through Congress, they have not raised the limit to a certain level, but suspended it entirely until 2025. This allows them to pay their bills until that date and know that the next fight over raising the ceiling will not interfere with the presidential election. And the rest of the world can breathe a sigh of relief once the deal is signed because a US default would have a global impact. Republicans wanted a freeze on overall spending for 10 years, with a rise in defence spending and cuts to other budgets. The agreement keeps non-defence spending flat next year, with a 1% rise in 2025. The implications of this belt tightening is as yet unclear. Defence spending would increase to $886bn, which amounts to a 3% rise on this year. There are no budget caps after 2025. The legislation will result in $1.5tn in savings over a decade, the independent Congressional Budget Office has said. Full funding for the medical care of military veterans would also increase, in line with what President Biden had sought. Nomia: Both sides claim victory here. The White House says these cuts are not significant. The defence spending rise is what President Biden wanted but it's below the rate of inflation and doesn't meet the demands of the more hawkish Republicans.  With the public health emergency officially ended in May, Republicans had argued for the relief funds that were not spent to be returned. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated this will amount to about $30bn. Nomia: A win for Republicans. Many Democrats were concerned public health initiatives would be impacted by this, but it was easier for Biden to give up than other Republican priorities like Medicaid work requirements.  A central demand of Republicans was to toughen up the distribution of welfare benefits by attaching strings that would mean able-bodied recipients having to work to get food and healthcare help. Democrats were adamant this should not be on the table. The welfare being looked at by Republicans included Medicaid (health coverage for poor Americans), the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF). Medicaid remains untouched in the deal, but the age at which work requirements are included for those on SNAP was raised from 50 to 54. Nomia: The White House will be happy it gained exceptions to the food stamp requirements for veterans and people who are homeless but stricter work requirements overall are a win for Republicans. It proved to be a hard sell for progressive Democratic lawmakers. A win for Democrats was securing $80bn for a decade to help the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to enforce the tax code in last year's Inflation Reduction Act on the richest. Nomia: The Republicans wanted to dump the $80bn in IRS funding, claiming it would be used to hire an army of agents to audit Americans - the agency said it would also be used to modernise the system. Instead - in showcasing his deal-making skills - Biden agreed to cut $20bn but divert that cash to other non-defence spending. New rules will make it easier for both fossil fuel and renewable energy projects to get licences. This has long been advocated by Democratic Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia.  It will basically streamline the environmental review process and potentially get projects off the ground in a faster time. Nomia: A win and a loss for the White House. Both parties agree it takes far too long for new energy infrastructure to be built but disagree on what projects should be prioritised. Republicans want more gas pipelines and fossil fuel projects; Democrats want more clean energy. This was another red line for some progressive Democrats.   Student loan relief Republicans had wanted the Biden plan to forgive student debt to be rescinded but it survived. Nomia: The Biden administration's student debt case will be ultimately decided by the Supreme Court. But the bill does require the Biden administration to follow through with a plan to end the current pause - which has been in effect since the start of the pandemic - on student loan repayments by the end of summer.  Tax hikes Democrats had targeted wealthy Americans for new tax hikes but there are no new taxes here.  Nomia: House Democrats will be fuming about this. They were already critical that the White House did not make taxes on the rich and powerful the centrepiece of their talks.  Clean energy Republicans had wanted to repeal key provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act's clean energy and climate provisions but it was unscathed.  Nomia: A win for both - certainly as far as environmentalists are concerned.  The US renewable energy industry group the American Clean Power Association said it ""applauds President Joe Biden and Speaker Kevin McCarthy for prioritising national interests over partisan politics"".

Hawkish,Returning to the place where we saw our parents shot,2024-09-25,2017-11-16,By Andrew Whitehead,https://www.bbc.com/news/stories-41996612,"Seventy years ago, a young British couple was shot dead at a mission hospital in Kashmir, making orphans of their three sons - one only two weeks old. To mark the anniversary two of those sons, now white-haired, made a personal pilgrimage to the spot. ""I feel very emotional to be here,"" says Doug Dykes, standing yards from the veranda where his mother and father suffered fatal bullet wounds when he was two years old. ""I saw my parents being killed - that's what I've been told. My father tried to stop the attackers approaching the nuns and he was shot. I ran screaming towards my father. My mother ran after me - and then she was also shot."" There's a touch of anguish in his recollections - a sense that he may in some way have been responsible for the death of his mother.  We are standing by his parents' graves in this remote corner of the Kashmir valley, the headstones shaded by recently harvested apple and walnut trees.  It may seem like a tranquil spot, but Tom and Biddy Dykes, an army officer and his wife, were killed in the opening salvos of the Kashmir crisis - and 70 years later the conflict continues to claim lives just about every day. In all, six people lost their lives at St Joseph's Catholic mission in the riverside town of Baramulla on that October morning in 1947. Jose Barretto, the husband of the hospital doctor, tried to save the nuns who ran the mission and was put up against a tree and shot. A nurse, Philomena, died seeking to protect the patients. Motia Devi Kapoor, a patient, was stabbed to death in her hospital bed. The Franciscan Missionaries of Mary also lost one of their own - Sister Teresalina, a newly-arrived Spanish nun in her 20s. She leapt in front of the convent's Belgian mother superior, taking a bullet intended for the older woman. She is buried in the nuns' graveyard on the other side of the mission grounds.  All were murdered by armed tribesmen from Pakistan who invaded Kashmir to try to prevent the princely state becoming part of India after the British withdrawal - and to take away as much loot as they could carry. As they ransacked St Joseph's on 27 October 1947 the first Indian troops were landing in Kashmir to repulse the invaders - and they have been here ever since to prevent the region being seized by Pakistan, which claims it as its own. Security concerns were the main reason why the oldest of the three Dykes children, named Tom like his father, never managed to revisit Baramulla before his death in 2003. When I met him a few years earlier his recollections of the attack were extraordinarily vivid. ""I can remember waking up, and there was gunfire all around the place,"" he told me.  ""Then these fellows that had raided the hospital started to batter down the door of the room we were in. The splinters started to fly across the room, and I could see the wild faces through the cracks in the door. ""The tribesmen were looting the place, they were pulling everything apart, and putting their booty into sheets which lay on the floor and were made up into bundles.""  A family servant managed to take the five-year-old away from the marauders. A little later they returned to see if they could find Tom's family. ""We went back to the central part of the hospital, a garden area with a path around it. And we came across these bodies, covered with blood. And sitting on top, howling his eyes out, was my little brother Douglas."" I stumbled on this story when, 20 years ago, I met the last remaining nun who had survived the ordeal. Sister Emilia, an Italian, recounted how the tribesmen had climbed over the mission walls, smashed through locked doors and manhandled some of the nuns. After they killed her friend - the new Spanish sister, Teresalina - Emilia thought she too was about to die. The hospital run by the 16 nuns had a high reputation. Biddy Dykes - a motherly woman with a ""round, happy face darkish hair and a lovely smile"", in the description of another army wife - went there to give birth to at least two of her sons.  Their father was a Sandhurst-trained soldier from a family with a tradition of service in the British Indian army. He married Biddy, a military nurse, at Agra, the city of the Taj Mahal, in 1940, and had risen to the rank of lieutenant-colonel by the end of World War Two. When the British pulled out of India in August 1947, he agreed to stay on for a few months as an officer in the Indian army's Sikh Regiment to help the transition. The family has an anguished letter Biddy Dykes wrote 10 days before she died, shortly after giving birth to her third son, James. The security situation was alarming and she was desperately waiting for her husband to turn up and get them out. ""Hells Bells, I'd give anything to see Tom walk in this evening,"" she wrote. ""He said in one letter that he'd be up here today. But I don't think there is an earthly chance."" In fact, Dykes did make it to Baramulla but was unable to get his family to safety.  A letter has emerged that he wrote after his arrival to a British officer in the Kashmiri capital, Srinagar, just 30 miles away. In it he explains that he has come to collect his family only to be ""overtaken by the present events"", in his astonishingly understated words. In clipped military fashion, he writes: ""I should be most grateful if you would send a vehicle here to Baramulla to collect us."" With an invasion underway, the evacuation was impractical. Two days later, he and his wife were dead. The three orphaned Dykes boys along with about 70 others were held captive in a single hospital ward for 10 days, while war raged around them. The Indian air force repeatedly bombed the mission, which the Pakistani invaders were using as a transport and supplies depot. The two older boys eventually returned to Britain by boat. James, the baby, was so weak he was not expected to survive. He was initially cared for by Lady Messervy, the wife of the British general who had become the first commander-in-chief of the Pakistan army, and slowly began to improve. When, a few months later, he was well enough to make the journey home, he was taken in by a different wing of the family. He didn't see a lot of his older brothers as they were growing up and at 18 he emigrated to South Africa. ""We never talked much about our parents - we knew the bare facts of what happened, but we were encouraged not to dwell on it,"" says Doug Dykes, a brewer by profession who lives in Dorking, just outside London. It was only when I made contact with the family, sent photos of the graves and sought their testimony, that the brothers started to talk among themselves about their memories and feelings, he tells me. St Joseph's lies at the western end of Indian-administered Kashmir, where the mountains start to close in on the valley. The road from the Kashmiri capital, Srinagar, is lined by Indian army bases and choked with the incessant movement of the huge numbers of troops deployed to ensure that neither Pakistan nor Kashmiri separatists prise the region from Indian control. Today there are 13 nuns at St Joseph's, all Indian - though none Kashmiri. In 1947 all except one were from Europe. As well as the  small hospital - now, as then, specialising in maternal and women's health - they run a nursing institute which is currently training 67 local Kashmiri girls. The nuns recount how at times in recent years, as the security situation worsened, they have been encouraged to pull out of Baramulla. But they have insisted on staying. The service they provide to the local community is clearly appreciated, as is the evident compassion with which they conduct their mission. For the 70th anniversary of the killings, the nuns took it on themselves to organise a memorial mass, candle-bearing processions and the laying of wreaths to honour those who lost their lives. They invited the two surviving Dykes children to attend and asked if I would come along too.  The army has spruced up the graves for the occasion - a touch of whitewash, a few additional pot plants and camouflage sheets to protect those gathering around the graves. The quiet of the occasion is broken by the whirr of an army surveillance drone overhead, keeping an eye out for intruders. Col Dykes lies in the only Commonwealth war grave in Kashmir, and the top-ranking Indian general in the area places a wreath, as does the diocesan bishop and the provincial head of the nuns' order. The Dykes sons both lay wreaths too - Doug makes a point of honouring his mother. For Doug and James Dykes, the warmth of the welcome from the nuns and the poignancy of the ceremonies is overpowering. James, who stayed in South Africa and made a career as a tax consultant, is able to visit the room where his mother gave birth to him, as well as seeing the spot his parents were buried just two weeks later.  ""I'm gobsmacked by it all. I just can't find the words,"" he says.  ""I never expected to make it here."" Neither of the surviving brothers can be sure to make it to Kashmir again. It was a precious chance - possibly a last chance - to get close to the young couple who died here, and whom they have thought about all their lives.

Hawkish,New sea wall on storm-hit track is 'success',2024-09-25,2021-02-05,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-55939197,"A new sea wall is protecting a railway track which was destroyed in a fierce storm say rail chiefs. Part of the line, which runs along a stretch of beach at Dawlish in Devon, was washed away by the sea in February 2014. It left Cornwall and most of Devon without a railway line to the rest of the country for several weeks. Network Rail said the wall will ""protect the town and region for at least the next 100 years"". The line, which was designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, was left dangling in the air by the storm. It was reopened eight weeks later and then the work started on creating a new £80m sea wall to give the line long-term protection. In May 2019 Network Rail started construction. It completed the first section, which runs for 1,180ft (360m) along Marine Parade west of Dawlish station, in July 2020.  Network Rail said further storms since completion of the first phase had ""showed the wall's effectiveness"", with waves ""successfully being deflected back out to sea"". Work on a second section of the wall, which will protect the eastern side of the station, started in November and is ""progressing well"", said Network Rail. A major part of the work has involved an eight-legged, walking jack-up barge, known as a Wavewalker, which has been used to drive piles into the ground. Alison Foden, Mayor of Dawlish, said the work was ""vitally important"" for the town and progress with the wall had been ""brilliant"". The project is expected to be completed by the start of 2023.

Hawkish,Cuba opens up its economy to private businesses,2024-09-25,2021-02-07,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-55967709,"Cuba has announced it will allow private businesses to operate in most sectors, in what is a major reform to its state-controlled economy. Labour Minister Marta Elena Feito said the list of authorised activities had expanded from 127 to more than 2,000.  Only a minority of sectors would be reserved for the state, she said. The communist country's economy has been hit hard by the pandemic and US sanctions introduced by the Trump administration. Last year its economy shrank by 11% - its worst decline in almost three decades - and Cubans have been facing shortages of basic goods. Ms Feito said just 124 economic activities would be exempt from private involvement although she did not mention which ones. ""That private work continues to develop, is the objective of this reform,"" Ms Feito was quoted by AFP as saying. She said the move would ""help free the productive forces"" of the private sector. Experts on Cuba's tangled and complicated economy say the step essentially opens up almost all economic activity on the island to some form of private enterprise, the BBC's Will Grant in Havana says. This will be a significant shot in the arm for those families and individuals who harbour hopes of moving beyond just the very small businesses into medium-sized ventures, he notes. Apart from hundreds of thousands of small farms, Cuba's non-state sector is composed mainly of small private businesses run by artisans, taxi drivers and tradesmen. Around 600,000 people, around 13% of the workforce, joined the private sector when the opportunity arose. However a large number of private businesses are involved in the island's tourist industry, which has been hard hit by the pandemic and sanctions. Given how slowly reforms tend to move in Cuba, it may still be some time before the change is noticeable in daily economic life, our correspondent says. Some 60 years of hostility between the US and Cuba were eased in 2015 when then US President Obama and Cuban leader Raul Castro agreed to normalise relations, allowing US citizens to visit the island and empowering local businesses. But Obama's efforts were rolled back by his successor, President Donald Trump, with the support of hawkish Cuban-Americans who saw Mr Obama's historic opening as an appeasement of Castro's communist regime. New US President Joe Biden - who was Barack Obama's vice-president - has previously signalled that he wants to improve US-Cuban relations but observers say it is not clear how high it might be on his priority list."
Hawkish,Barge with legs used for sea wall work,2024-09-25,2020-11-10,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-54893599,"A barge on legs will help construct an £80m sea wall to protect a rail line previously destroyed by storms. The eight-legged, self-contained walking barge, known as a Wavewalker, is the only one of its kind in Europe. Work at Dawlish, south Devon, marks the first time this type of barge has been used to maintain the UK rail network. In 2014, a storm caused a stretch of the coastal railway to collapse into the sea - cutting off the south west peninsular from the rest of the line. The jack-up barge can be raised or lowered for work in challenging environments and allows workers to operate safely and for longer, engineers said. Huw Jones, from civil engineering firm BAM Nuttall who will operate the barge, said the railway line was ""enormously exposed to the worst weather that the English Channel can produce"".  He said: ""Working in this environment requires imaginative solutions and innovative thinking and our use of the Wavewalker is a great example of that. ""The jack-up barge allows us to work safely on the foundations of a new sea-wall on a 24-7 basis, regardless of tides."" Network Rail said the construction of the new sea wall will take around two years to complete"

The foundation said it set up a dedicated server to cope with the expected high online demand for places at the service next month. Professor Hawking died after a long battle with motor neurone disease. Thousands lined the streets of his home city for his funeral on 31 March. The popularity of Prof Hawking's life and work has caused problems before when demand for his PhD thesis intermittently crashed part of Cambridge University's website as physics fans flocked to read his work when it was published online in October.

Hawkish,Musician celebrates 90 years in show business,2024-09-25,2023-07-29,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-oxfordshire-66327570,"A musician is celebrating 90 years in show business by doing what he loves best - playing live music.  Alan Grahame, from Henley On Thames, turned 96 on 23 July and played at his local pub to celebrate.  Over his long career the multi-instrumentalist has toured with world-famous stars including Shirley Bassey, Tom Jones, and Engelbert Humperdinck. Mr Grahame said: ""I am planning on playing until I am at least a hundred years old.""   Despite his age, he still plays the vibraphone and other kinds of percussion, joining bands for live performances all over the UK. He started his career in 1933 playing in seaside shows in Dawlish, Devon.  Before signing up to the Army during World War Two, he joined other musicians entertaining the troops in south London and Surrey.  After the war ended, he started his own band with other soldiers. Gaining success Mr Grahame also appeared regularly on Top of the Pops, Parkinson, Play School and starred in in the long running live ITV show Lunchbox. When Tom Jones worked on his famous hit It's Not Unusual, Mr Grahame was right beside him.  He said: ""We didn't know who it was, we were just musicians and of course the rest is history. ""This young guy came in all hair and Jack-the-lad, and we laid about four tracks. ""I was very fortunate. I did the Albert Hall with Shirley every concert she did and then we had several tours abroad.  ""In those days it was a big orchestra with live strings rather than a synthesizer or keyboard."" He added: ""Live music keeps me going. I love nothing better than being on stage and giving my all as an entertainer.""

Hawkish,How a ship where hundreds drowned became a piece of art,2024-09-25,2019-05-15,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-48252938,"If the purpose of art is to elicit a strong reaction then exhibiting a shipwreck at one of the world's biggest art exhibitions has passed the test. But has it overstepped the boundaries of taste? Critics have hit out at the use of the hull of the ship, in which hundreds of migrants drowned, at the Venice Biennale. The fishing vessel sank on its trip from Libya to Italy in 2015 and at least 700 people, many from Africa, died as a result. Swiss-Icelandic artist Christoph Büchel brought the boat to the Biennale which opened to the public at the weekend.  He said that his exhibit, Barca Nostra (Our Boat), was intended to be ""a monument to contemporary migration"". It was the Mediterranean's deadliest shipwreck in living memory and happened in the middle of the European migrant crisis, which peaked in 2016 with an estimated 5,096 people dying or going missing trying to cross the Mediterranean - the highest number ever recorded. Some art critics have been scathing in their attacks on Büchel's use of the ship.  In the Guardian, Adrian Searle calls it a vulgar gesture. ""I found Büchel's appropriation of the boat in which so many migrants lost their lives a vile and mawkish spectacle in the context of the Biennale. ""The best one can say of Büchel's intervention is that it brings us face to face with death. Biennale visitors pause to take selfies in front of it."" How people interact with the boat has appeared to alarm observers. A tweet showing a cafe next to the boat is described as ""peak art world"" by Martin Herbert. Matthew Mpoke Bigg from the UN refugee agency points out that people were ""sipping aperitifs at a nearby cafe in the sunshine, some apparently ignorant of the horror of what happened there"". Calling it the ""most troubling"" exhibit at the Biennale,  Cristina Ruiz in the Art Newspaper gives an explanation why art lovers may not be acting in the sombre way some might expect. ""Art can and should deal with the most pressing issues of our time and Büchel's boat would easily be the most important inclusion in [the] Biennale if it were not for the fact that Büchel has chosen to provide no labels or signs near the rusting vessel.  ""It is true that there is information about the boat and its history in the Biennale catalogue but only a small proportion of visitors purchase this.  ""So many, if not most, exhibition goers will eat and drink in the shadow of this ship with absolutely no idea of the tragedy that unfolded there."" Who died in the 18 April 2015 shipwreck? Context is everything, it seems for these critics.  One detail of context to be considered is the motivation of the curator of the Venice Biennale, explains BBC arts editor Will Gompertz. He points out that curator Ralph Rugoff  had already said art should be ""entertaining"".  But the critics went further, starting to question the purpose of art in our society at this point.  ""Horrified"" by the exhibit, Stephen Pritchard wrote in his blog Colouring in Culture that the artist was exploiting the tragedy: ""To see the art world fawn over a shipwreck that was a grave to so many people is utterly abhorrent. ""To exhibit it as a 'relic' or 'monument' such a tragic loss of life is to reify, commodify and totally exploit the lives of not only those who lost their lives but migration itself."" While Yasmin Alibhai-Brown says in the I newspaper that the exhibit is reflective of a worrying trend in the art world - an exhibit that ""lacks integrity"". ""Büchel simply used the dispossessed on the high seas to flaunt his artistic and political nihilism"". For her, it was not the people taking selfies and having picnics next to the tragic artefact that stood out. Instead, it was what was not there that led her to conclude the exhibit was ""barbarous"": ""The dead souls are not there, not even as black silhouettes. They are, one surmises, unimportant to the 'provocative' Swiss-Icelandic artist, Christopher Büchel"". Büchel himself declined to comment when contacted by the BBC.

""The vessel has become a symbolic object, dedicated not only to the victims of the tragic event in 2015 and the people involved in its recovery, but to our mutual responsibility representing the collective policies and politics that create such wrecks."""
Hawkish,Shipwrecked people smugglers jailed,2024-09-25,2021-07-06,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-57737560,"A people smuggler has been jailed after his yacht ran aground with eight Albanians on board. James Wisbey tried to bring the migrants across the English Channel from France through gales last December but the boat was wrecked off Devon. Wisbey, 55, of West Hoe, Plymouth, and accomplice Faye Miles, 38, of no fixed address, admitted conspiracy to break immigration rules.  He was jailed for five years and four months, and Miles for two years. Exeter Crown Court heard Wisbey stayed in contact with Albanian organiser Indrit Barhani and received a £1,000 down payment before he set off. He arrived in France on 12 December and was in the Channel with the migrants on his 27ft (8.2m) vessel by the morning of 14 December, but he beached at Horse Cove, Teignmouth, at 16:11 GMT.  Coastguards had been monitoring the boat and Wisbey and Miles were arrested on the beach, where he joked ""next time I'll do it properly and not take any short cuts"". The eight passengers scrambled ashore, across the main Paddington to Penzance railway line and up a cliff, where they were arrested. The court heard they had paid 20,000 euros but were not given food or water, causing them to be ""hungry, dehydrated and terrified"". A video taken inside the boat showed it was in very basic condition with no space for the passengers to sleep. Judge Timothy Rose described Wisbey's actions as ""cynical, appalling and unforgiveable"" as he jailed him at Exeter Crown Court. Barhani, 32, of London, will be sentenced on 24 September, if a dispute about his role in the scheme can be resolved. He admitted conspiracy to breach the Immigration Act when he appeared in court in April."
Hawkish,Bomb maker with mental illness sentenced,2024-09-25,2017-06-27,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-40419500,"A man with paranoid schizophrenia who was found with a ""viable"" bomb in his home has been sent to hospital to treat his mental health problems. Timothy Holman, 42, from Ilfracombe, pleaded guilty to making an explosive substance at Exeter Crown Court. Police were called to Osborne Road on 9 December 2016 after his mental health worker raised concerns. Holman built a pipe bomb in his bedroom and was making three other devices when police discovered his array of weapons. More on the bomb maker, and other Devon news Officers found a machete, a knife, a baseball bat and BB guns as well as some copper pipes. Part of the residential street where Mr Holman lived was evacuated for two nights and his home was searched following a short siege. In passing the sentence of a hospital order for an indefinite period, Judge Geoffrey Mercer told Mr Holman: ""These events were inextricably linked to your long standing mental illness."" His defence barrister Richard Crabb told the court: ""There is no evidence that he was motivated by political or terrorist beliefs.  ""It was due to a mistaken belief, as a result of his mental illness, that he was under some sort of threat."" The order means he will be treated at Langdon Hospital in Dawlish and cannot be released without the agreement of the Ministry of Justice."

Hawkish,Trump 'will quit Kim talks if not fruitful',2024-09-25,2018-04-18,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-43818751,"US President Donald Trump says that if his planned talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un are not fruitful he will ""walk out"". At a joint news conference, he and Japanese PM Shinzo Abe said maximum pressure must be maintained on North Korea over nuclear disarmament. Mr Abe is at the president's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida for talks. Earlier, Mr Trump confirmed that CIA Director Mike Pompeo had made a secret trip to North Korea to meet Mr Kim. He said Mr Pompeo had forged a ""good relationship"" with Mr Kim - whom the US president was last year calling ""little rocket man"" - and that the meeting had gone ""very smoothly"". The visit marked the highest-level contact between the US and North Korea since 2000. Mr Trump is expected to hold a summit with Mr Kim by June. Details, including a location, are still being worked out. Meanwhile, South Korean president Moon Jae-in is set to meet Mr Kim next week. Speaking on Thursday, Mr Moon said North Korea had said it was ready for ""complete denuclearisation"", and called for ""bold imagination and creative solutions"" to ensure the Koreas summit and the Trump-Kim summit would succeed. President Trump said at the joint news conference that if he did not think the meeting would be successful he would not go, and if the meeting went ahead but was not productive, he would walk out. ""Our campaign of maximum pressure will continue until North Korea denuclearises,"" he added. ""As I've said before, there is a bright path available to North Korea when it achieves denuclearisation in a complete and verifiable and irreversible way. It would be a great day for them, it would be a great day for the world."" On trade, Mr Trump and Mr Abe agreed to start talks on ""free, fair and reciprocal trade deals"".  Mr Trump said the US remained opposed to rejoining the Trans Pacific Partnership unless Japan and other parties to the trade pact offered ""a deal that I can't refuse"".  The US president did not exempt Japan from punitive steel and aluminium tariffs, as he has done for other US allies.  Turning to North Korea, Mr Abe said he had urged President Trump to help bring about the release of Japanese citizens kidnapped by North Korea in the 1970s and 1980s. Actress kidnapped by North Korea dies Abducted S Korean back from North  North Korea abductee meeting praised Three US citizens are also being held in North Korea. Mr Trump said the US would ""work very hard"" to try to bring the Japanese abductees home.  ""We are likewise fighting very diligently to get the three American citizens back,"" Mr Trump added. ""I think there's a good chance of doing it. We're having very good dialogue.""  The secret trip took place after Mr Pompeo was nominated by President Trump to replace Rex Tillerson as secretary of state. No details are known about the talks other than that they were to prepare for the forthcoming Trump-Kim summit.  Mr Pompeo is expected to be confirmed as the top US diplomat by the Republican-controlled Senate in the coming weeks, although Democratic opposition to the conservative's candidacy is strong.  Senator Robert Menendez, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, said he did not think Mr Pompeo's ""past sentiments"" reflected American values. The hawkish CIA chief's opposition to same-sex marriage has come under scrutiny and he has also made controversial remarks about Islam.  Mr Trump surprised the international community last month by accepting Pyongyang's suggestion for direct talks. It would be unprecedented for a sitting US president to meet a North Korean leader.  He has said the summit will take place either in early June or ""a little before that"" and that several sites are under consideration. Experts have speculated that a location for talks could be the Demilitarised Zone between North and South Korea, another Asian country, or a neutral European country.  North Korea has been isolated for decades because of its human rights abuses and pursuit of nuclear weapons, in defiance of international laws and UN sanctions. It has carried out six nuclear tests, and has missiles that it says could reach the US. But South Korea's hosting of the Winter Olympics in February gave an unexpected window for diplomacy, and in the weeks since there have been a flurry of visits to the North from China, South Korea and now the US.

Hawkish,Clothes and fuel costs push prices to 2-year high,2024-09-25,2021-06-16,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-57490101,"The UK inflation rate jumped to 2.1% in the year to May, the highest for almost two years, as the easing of lockdown sparked a rise in consumer spending. The Consumer Prices Index measure of inflation rose from 1.5% in April, according to the Office for National Statistics, driven by the rising cost of fuel and clothing. The rate is now above the Bank of England's 2% target for inflation.  That will fuel the debate about whether it's time to raise interest rates. May's reading was above most economists' forecasts of an increase of about 1.8%. Simply put, inflation is the rate at which prices are rising - if the cost of a £1 jar of jam rises by 5p, then jam inflation is 5%. It applies to services too, like having your nails done or getting your car valeted. You may not notice low levels of inflation from month to month, but in the long term, these price rises can have a big impact on how much you can buy with your money. Read more about inflation here. ONS chief economist Grant Fitzner said the biggest single rise was coming from fuel prices, which were falling this time last year as the lockdown started to bite.  Petrol and diesel saw a 17.9% price surge over the past year, representing the highest increase for more than four years. Crude oil prices have been increasing over the past few months, which is expected to continue feeding through to pump prices. Clothing prices also increased by 2.3%, the biggest rise since 2018, as retailers significantly reduced their discounting a month after welcoming customers back into stores. The rise in inflation was, however, partly offset by a negative impact from cheaper food and drink prices. Bread, cereals and meat prices all dipped after seeing significant rises a year earlier. Karen Ward, a chief market strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management, told the BBC: ""Consumers have got all these savings they accumulated last year when they weren't allowed out. But supply is really struggling to keep pace, and so what we are seeing therefore is pops of prices in various aspects of the consumer basket."" It certainly was. Most economists were expecting inflation to hit 1.8%, and are now suggesting the rate could rise faster and higher over the next few months than previously thought. JP Morgan's Ms Ward described May's rate as a ""big upside surprise"". And HSBC economist Chris Hare said: ""Whether the upside news proves temporary or persistent, [May's rate] is clearly a hawkish surprise."" The price data was collected on or around May 11, before pubs and restaurants were allowed to serve customers indoors and cinemas and hotels reopened from 17 May. The Bank of England has said it expects inflation to hit 2.5% by the end of this year before settling back to its 2% target as the impact of post-lockdown energy price rises fades along with other cost pressures, such as bottlenecks in supply chains. As you'd expect, economists are divided.  Ms Ward said that if inflation pressure was sustained into next year, ""we could see interest rate hikes"" to dampen down rising prices.  UK rates, however, remain at historic lows. Also, there are some benefits to rising rates - for example, on the amount of interest people earn on savings.  Nevertheless, the low-rate environment that has existed for a decade and upward changes could be a shock for many consumers and businesses. Last week, the Bank of England's chief economist, Andy Haldane, said a rise in inflation above the central bank's target must be only temporary, and that long-term levels of high inflation need to be ""avoided at all costs"". Some economists are concerned that despite rising inflation, governments continue to use stimulus to jump-start their post-Covid economies.  Former treasury official Lord Nick Macpherson tweeted on Wednesday that Bank of England policies to control the amount of money in the economy are ""excessively loose"". The UK is by no means an isolated case. In the US, where President Joe Biden has proposed a $6 trillion stimulus package, consumer prices hit 5% in May, the highest in almost 13 years. Jack Leslie, an economist at the Resolution Foundation think tank, said the speeding up of UK price growth from 0.3% last November to 2.1% in May represented the fastest six-month rise since sterling collapsed after the 2008-09 financial crisis. ""But UK inflationary pressures are different - and nowhere as near as large - as those causing fierce debate in the US,"" he said. In China, long a source of cheap goods for the world, inflation is also rising - effectively exporting higher prices. And Eurozone inflation rose to 2% in May, the first time the rate has surpassed the European Central Bank's target in more than two years. Nevertheless, central banks seems committed to keeping rates low. The US Fed, for example, expects rates to remain close to zero until 2023.  Given the lag between changes in rate policy and the required impact on the economy, some economists worry that central banks could be leaving it too late to change direction. If you think this morning's higher-than-expected inflation number is something to be scared about, the financial markets don't share your view.  Traders on foreign currency markets, for example, were unimpressed, with the pound shifting up a modest 0.3% against the euro or 0.2% against the dollar.  Inflation may be slightly above the 2% target but it's no higher than it was in July 2019 and well below the 5% inflation of ten years ago, when the global economy was recovering from the 2008 financial crisis. Part of the reason the markets shrugged off the inflation figure is the widespread belief that the upward pressure on prices is temporary.  Prices of raw materials such as wood and steel have shot up from a combination of two things - demand after economies re-opened and supplies still coming back up on stream. The result? Shortages and price rises.  The confident expectation is that, for example, as steel manufacturers crank up production there'll be more steel to meet demand so its price will fall back, relieving the inflationary pressure.  As summer turns to autumn we'll find out if that expectation is justified.  "
Hawkish,The day I thought we'd unplugged Stephen Hawking,2024-09-25,2018-03-14,By Pallab Ghosh,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-43400021,"I was lucky enough to meet Prof Stephen Hawking several times. Each time it was a joy.  There was a marvellous twinkle in his eye and always a mischievous sense of humour. It was these qualities and his determination not to allow his disability to prevent him from contributing to research that made him so famous and indeed so loved by people all across the world. I first went to interview Prof Hawking in 2004 at his office in Cambridge.  I felt a mixture of awe and excitement as I waited for the man who for years had been my idol. He seemed to smile at me as he entered the room which immediately put me at my ease. The camera operator I was with wanted to make a last minute adjustment to his lighting and so he asked Prof Hawking's staff if he could pull out one of the plugs in the office so that he could use the socket for his equipment. Without waiting for a response he pulled the plug and the room was filled with a deafening siren.  Prof Hawking then slouched forward and I feared that my colleague had inadvertently unplugged a vital piece of life-support equipment. Fortunately, it was the alarm to the uninterruptable power supply to his office computer and he was slouched forward with mirth at our incompetence. Thankfully, he invited me to interview him many times after that.  We talked a lot about his science of course. But what I remember most was his humanity.  As well as his own work he would often talk about the social implications of research and the responsibility scientists had to make sure that their work was used for  the benefit of society. And it was for this that he became the world's most famous scientist.  He reached people not normally interested in science because of his compassion as well as his genius.  And that wicked sense of humour.  When I asked him how we could test his belief that radiation emerged from black holes, he told me that he did not wish to get too close to a black hole for fear of falling in - but he did agree that it would be a wonderful way to go.

Hawkish,Hawking: Did he change views on disability?,2024-09-25,2018-03-14,By James Gallagher,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-43399921,"Stephen Hawking was both one of the world's most famous scientists and most famous disabled people.  His life was a juxtaposition of sparkling intellect and failing body. Prof Hawking was diagnosed with a rare form of motor neurone disease when he was 22.  The nerves that controlled his muscles were failing and he became trapped in his body, but his mind was still free.  He reached the height of his field while being a wheelchair user and communicating through a synthetic voice.  So did he change society's perceptions of disability?  ""I think he's done more than anyone else,"" said Prof Paul Shellard, who was a student of Prof Hawking. He told the BBC: ""He's been an incredible exemplar of there being no boundary to human endeavour. ""He identified what he could do well, exceptionally well, and focussed on that, not what he couldn't do.""   That made him a role-model and inspiration for many.  Prof Hawking certainly raised awareness of motor neurone diseases.  One of his major contributions to disability in general was simply being visible - often at a time when disabled voices were missing from popular culture. He made small-screen appearances on The Simpsons, Star Trek and The Big Bang Theory. His life was dramatised by the BBC and in the film The Theory of Everything.  Steve Bell, from the MND association, said: ""He was probably the most famous person with a physical disability and it almost normalises it to see his absolute genius.  ""I think it affected a lot of people, seeing he's more than a trapped body. ""The public's view of disability has changed."" But Prof Hawking's life was exceptional. He lived five decades longer than doctors expected. Many others with motor neurone disease die in the years after diagnosis.  He was a theoretical physicist. His laboratory was in the mind, his scientific equipment was mathematics.  Prof Hawking was able to continue to pursue his career in a way that would have been much harder in other scientific disciplines and impossible in many other professions. It remains an open question how much he would have achieved if he was disabled from birth rather than after graduating with a first at Oxford.  Today, disabled people are more than twice as likely to be unemployed than people without disability. Prof Hawking's only advice on disability was to focus on what could be achieved.  ""My advice to other disabled people would be, concentrate on things your disability doesn't prevent you doing well, and don't regret the things it interferes with. Don't be disabled in spirit, as well as physically,"" he said in an interview with the New York Times."
Hawkish,Bird flu killed wild birds in south west England,2024-09-25,2020-11-11,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-gloucestershire-54901588,"Wild birds in three areas of south west England have died from bird flu.  Three wild geese found dead at the end of last month at the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust (WWT) at Slimbridge, Gloucestershire, tested positive for the H5N8 strain of avian influenza. Defra said swans that died near Dawlish, Devon and a wild goose in Weymouth, Dorset also tested positive. Public Health England (PHE) advice is that the risk to public health from the strain of the flu is ""very low"". WWT said it was working with the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA), PHE, and Gloucestershire County Council to monitor the situation.  The two greylag geese and one Canada goose were sent to APHA for testing, and results show they had the H5N8 strain of avian influenza. H5N8 is the same strain that infected a poultry farm in Frodsham, Cheshire earlier this month, and which has been found recently in Germany and the Netherlands. Chief veterinary officer, Christine Middlemiss, said it was ""important now more than ever"" for bird keepers ensure they ""maintain and strengthen good biosecurity... to ensure we prevent further outbreaks"". ""Public Health England has confirmed that the risk to public health is very low and the Food Standards Agency advises that bird flu poses a very low food safety risk for UK consumers. ""We ask that people continue to report findings of dead wild birds so that we can investigate the extent of infection."" A WWT spokesman said staff were following advice, research and a pre-prepared response plan, to ensure the wildlife and people at Slimbridge ""have the best protection"". The nature reserve has been closed to the public since 5 November in compliance with government coronavirus regulations for the four-week lockdown in England.  The risk level of avian influenza incursion in wild birds in Great Britain has been raised to ""high"" following the unrelated confirmed cases in Gloucestershire and Cheshire.

Hawkish,John Bolton ready to testify in Trump impeachment,2024-09-25,2020-01-06,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-51012941,"Former White House National Security Adviser John Bolton says he is willing to testify at President Donald Trump's impeachment trial in the Senate. ""I have concluded that, if the Senate issues a subpoena for my testimony, I am prepared to testify,"" Mr Bolton said in a statement.  He has previously complied with the White House directive not to co-operate with the Democratic-led inquiry.  Mr Bolton would be the most senior former Trump adviser to testify. Mr Trump, a Republican, was impeached by the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives last month. He was the third US president ever to incur such a congressional sanction. Mr Bolton wrote on his website on Monday: ""During the present impeachment controversy, I have tried to meet my obligations both as a citizen and as former National Security Adviser.  ""Since my testimony is once again at issue, I have had to resolve the serious competing issues as best I could, based on careful consideration and study."" The hawkish former national security adviser was fired by President Trump in September after 16 months on the job.  John Bolton is a potentially important witness in the abuse-of-power case against Donald Trump. If he testifies in a Senate trial of the president, it could be a blockbuster moment. It's hard not to see Mr Bolton's latest announcement, however, in the context of his previous hints, pirouettes and provocative tweets on testifying.  While he threatened a protracted legal battle to prevent appearing before House impeachment investigators, for instance, his lawyer hinted that there were many previously undisclosed ""meetings and conversations"" of which Mr Bolton had knowledge. Stonewall, wink, repeat.  It may be a good strategy for staying in the public eye - and, perhaps, boosting upcoming book sales - but Democrats will find it infuriating. It's also far from guaranteed that Mr Bolton will ever be subpoenaed by the Senate.  His announcement might marginally increase the pressure on moderate Senate Republicans to join with Democrats and form a majority to call for witnesses in the presidential trial.  Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell has proven skilled at keeping his party in line, however, and immune to pressure when it comes to pursuing the course of action he views as most politically beneficial.  It will take more than a Bolton statement to make him fold. His potential firsthand knowledge of key events surrounding the Democratic-led investigation would make him a prize witness.  Mr Trump is accused of abusing the power of his office by withholding US military aid in order to pressure Ukraine into smearing his political rival, former US Vice-President Joe Biden. Mr Bolton likened that alleged White House bargaining chip to a ""drug deal"", according to witness testimony during the House impeachment investigation.  His aides testified that he was deeply concerned by Mr Trump's actions related to Ukraine.  Mr Bolton has kept a relatively low profile since leaving the White House, though he inked a book deal in November with publishing giant Simon & Schuster, reportedly worth $2m (£1.5m). Amid a political row, House Democrats have held off formally sending the two articles of impeachment to the Senate, which would trigger a trial in that chamber. It is so far unclear when they might do so.  The Republican-controlled Senate has been resisting Democratic demands for witnesses to be called in the trial. Mr Bolton's announcement may put pressure on the chamber's Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, to allow such testimony. Speaking from the chamber floor on Monday, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer compared Mr McConnell's handling of the impeachment proceedings to ""Alice in Wonderland - first the trial and then the evidence"".  ""If the Senate were to agree to leader McConnell's proposal, the Senate would act as little more than a nationally televised meeting of a mock trial club,"" said the New York Democrat.  The Senate is controlled by the president's fellow Republicans and therefore it is highly unlikely they will vote for Mr Trump to be removed from office."

In a one-star review, Chris Bennion of The Telegraph called it a ""trite, mawkish, soggy pudding of a series"". NME's James McMahon, however, said the show was ""going out on a high"" in his four-star review. The third series of after life currently has a healthy 76% audience score on reviews aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, but only 33% average score from critics. The series, which began in 2019, follows Tony Johnson (played Gervais) as he attempts to come to terms with the death of his wife from cancer. In his grief, Tony is nasty to many people around him and seemingly uncaring about the consequences of his actions and words. The series follows him as he grapples with his emotions and finds glimmers of hope from within his own life.  But many critics, who have generally welcomed previous seasons of the show, were disappointed by the six episodes of series three. ""Fans hoping for a satisfying, neat ending will be disappointed,"" wrote Emily Baker of the i paper. ""Not because questions are left unanswered, but because the questions have been abandoned altogether. ""Gervais's intentions are good, and I admit I shed a few tears, but the almost evangelical proclamations of living life to the fullest were manipulative. Can a TV show that inspires emotion really be that bad? (Spoiler: yes)."" She awarded the series two stars, concluding: ""It's the right time for After Life to be laid to rest and even though he has said he was unsure about the decision to end the show, Gervais must know there was nowhere else for it to go."" Abby Robinson of the Radio Times said: ""The very act of mourning is heavy and monotonous, and Gervais refuses to sugarcoat that, instead leaning into its permanence.  ""As a result, After Life has become something of an endurance test, and even Penelope Wilton (Anne) isn't able to lift us with her character's more hopeful dialogue. ""That being said, it's a given that the swathes of people who have followed the series from the very beginning (100 million households, according to Netflix) will relish the show's final chapter. They are simply happy to spend time in that bubble, enjoying the many faces and their respective idiosyncrasies."" Netflix subscribers sent the third series of After Life to the top of its streaming chart over the weekend, in spite of some poor reviews. ""Gervais is better than this,"" wrote Barbara Ellen in The Guardian. ""I loved it when he used to host the Golden Globes, genuinely alarming the A-list audience.  ""Here, the finale, with superb use of Joni Mitchell's Both Sides Now, shows imagination and spirit. Otherwise, I remain unconvinced by After Life's exploration of grief. For me, there's a blatant prodding of buttons; the sense of a cue card reading: 'Audience, cry now!' It's time for After Life to slip gently away."" In what was perhaps the most negative review, The Telegraph's Chris Bennion said the show ""wallows in its own cynical slurry pit of emotion and thin-skinned misanthropy"". ""This is not to say that After Life does not work on some levels,"" he acknowledged. ""It's designed as a feelgood tearjerker, and as it reaches its denouement the emotional beats are punched harder and harder, and the indie-song soundtrack gets sadder and sadder.  ""Hardcore fans of the show - which are legion - will mourn its passing, but for the rest of us, Gervais's maudlin curio remains a kind of purgatory."" There was a much more enthusiasm from NME's James McMahon, who awarded the series four stars. ""Unapologetically nasty, saccharine, lovely and poignant,"" he said of the series. ""It's also often a bit of a mess, a little bit like life itself. ""[Tony] is often mean, a bit prejudiced, arrogant, he thinks he's right about everything, the self-absorbed master of his own universe. And yet when the character achieves a genuine realisation - that life is brief and fragile, but worth having a good go at - it's all the more powerful for being so."" Metro's Charlotte Manning was similarly positive, also awarding the series four stars while saying the show had been brought to a ""natural, yet poignant end"". ""Of the core cast, Diane Morgan particularly excels as Kath. She offers further brilliantly cringe moments through a series of awful dates - and her sadness after they fail to go well,"" Manning wrote. ""In the Love Actually-esque style finale, Tony realises love, actually is all around him (including from Brandy the dog, who we promise is fine) and there are ultimately many glimmers of hope for the future and reasons to stay put at last."" Some critics drew comparisons with other shows which are popular with viewers but not always well-received by critics, such as the BBC's Mrs Brown's Boys. ""Ricky Gervais's After Life is a conundrum, noted Hugo Rifkind of The Times. ""Viewers love it and critics can't figure out why at all. ""Treated with a little more care, I suppose all of this could be saying really interesting things about male failure and loneliness. It's lazy, though. No idea or message is ever pursued. Nothing is.  ""The jokes, though, aren't really the point of After Life, and I'm sure they're not why it's so beloved either. Some of them, frankly, are incongruous, with Gervais just standing in the middle of the street, swearing at people. No, the point is the sentiment, which goes all the way to mawkish."" There was agreement from Louis Chilton in The Independent., who said: ""If you're not already on board with Gervais's shtick then this is unlikely to convert you - anyone looking for the usual mix of pseudo-ironic homophobia, fatphobia and sexism won't walk away empty-handed - but it's undeniably better than the serious parts of the script. ""Monologues about grief and recovery are painfully trite, painfully single-dimensional; it falls short of even syrupy fare like [Apple TV comedy] Ted Lasso. ""Ultimately, there are little things that endear you to After Life - among them a great soundtrack, a cast of characters who don't all look like conventional TV stars, a standout performance from Morgan and a brilliant cameo from Tim Key. But then it's all undone by a descent into clumsy sentimentalism."""
Hawkish,Fraggle Rock to be revived by Apple TV+,2024-09-25,2020-05-27,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-52813532,"It's time to stream your cares away, and leave your lockdown worries for another day... Because classic children's show Fraggle Rock is to be revived by Apple TV+, 33 years after the last series was made. Gobo, Red, Boober, Mokey, Wembley and Uncle Travelling Matt will reunite for more songs and adventures, to be co-produced by The Jim Henson Company. As well as the new series, every existing episode of the puppet show has just landed on Apple TV+. It's first time Apple TV+ has offered previously produced content. The Emmy-winning Fraggle Rock was devised by late Muppets creator Henson, and first appeared on TV in 1983. It ran for five series, ending in 1987. The new series will follow the recent celeb-filled Fraggle Rock: Rock On! shorts, which debuted on the same platform in April. In the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, it showed the cave-dwelling muppets observing social distancing, by living apart and interacting via a video chat system installed by their pudgy green neighbours the Doozers. The likes of actress Tiffany Haddish and singers Alanis Morissette and Ziggy Marley made cameos in the specials, which were made from the homes of various artists and producers using camera phones. A movie version of the show, starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt, has reportedly been in the works for years, but is still yet to see the light of day. Henson's daughter Lisa will executive produce the new series, which will feature on Apple's new roster alongside shows like Helpsters, from the Sesame Workshop, and Snoopy in Space, from Peanuts.

Hawkish,UK inflation at highest since April 2012,2024-09-25,2017-10-17,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-41649498,"The UK's key inflation rate hit its highest for more than five years in September, driven up by increases in transport and food prices.   The Consumer Prices Index (CPI) climbed to 3%, a level it last reached in April 2012, and up from 2.9% in August.   The pick-up in inflation raises the likelihood of an increase in interest rates - currently 0.25% - next month.  The figures are significant because state pension payments from April 2018 will rise in line with September's CPI. Under the ""triple lock"" guarantee, the basic state pension rises by a rate equal to September's CPI rate, earnings growth or 2.5%, whichever is the greatest.  At the moment, the full new state pension is £159.55 per week, equivalent to £8,296.60 per year. Business rates will go up by September's Retail Prices Index (RPI) of 3.9%. The fall in the pound since last year's Brexit vote has been one factor behind the rise in the inflation rate, as the cost of imported goods has risen.  ONS head of inflation Mike Prestwood said: ""Food prices and a range of transport costs helped to push up inflation in September. These effects were partly offset by clothing prices that rose less strongly than this time last year."" Inflation has hit a five year high and is now 0.9% above the rate of wage growth - meaning that the incomes squeeze is becoming tighter. And if you are employed in the public sector - where pay rises are capped at 1% - or rely on benefits - which are frozen - that squeeze is even tighter. With poor economic growth figures and uncertainty over the Brexit process, the Bank of England's decision on whether to raise interest rates next month is finely balanced. Yes, ""price stability"" is the main purpose of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee which makes the decision. But many believe that inflation may now have peaked as the effects of sterling's depreciation following the referendum dissipate. An interest rate rise now, which increases prices for millions of mortgage holders and could dampen economic activity, could be just the medicine the economy doesn't need.  The Bank of England is tasked with keeping CPI inflation at 2%, and last month its governor, Mark Carney, indicated interest rates could rise in the ""relatively near term"" if the economy continued on its current path. The governor of the Bank of England has to write a letter of explanation to the chancellor if the inflation rate is more than 1% either side of the 2% target. On Tuesday, Mr Carney told MPs on the Treasury Committee that ""inflation rising potentially above the 3% level in the coming months is something we have anticipated"", because of the fall in the value of the pound. He said he expected inflation to peak in October or November, and at that point he thought it would be ""more likely than not that I would be writing on behalf of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) a letter to the chancellor.""   Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""The tick upwards in inflation will increase expectations of a rate rise from the Bank of England later on this year, stoked by a flurry of hawkish rhetoric coming from Threadneedle Street."" However, he added, it is not a foregone conclusion, ""so it's probably best not to count those chickens until they're hatched"". Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said the Bank of England's policymakers ""should resist the temptation to raise interest rates, particularly during this period of heightened political uncertainty"". ""Raising rates before the UK economy is ready risks undermining consumer and business confidence, weakening the UK growth prospects further,"" he said.   Pensioners will be celebrating again. Today's CPI inflation figure means they will get a 3% rise next April, their largest pension increase for six years.  Those on the new state pension will see their weekly income rise to £164.  Compare that to workers, who've seen their earnings rise by 2.1% over the last year. This is all thanks to the triple lock, which sees the state pension rise by the highest of earnings, prices or 2.5%. Food for thought for the chancellor, perhaps, who's reported to be considering tax concessions for younger people in his forthcoming budget, to even-up the inter-generational unfairness that the triple lock has contributed to. The 2.5% element of the triple lock is due to be dropped in 2021."
Hawkish,"UK can be China-US peacemaker, says ex-minister",2024-09-25,2021-12-23,By Justin Parkinson,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-58463492,"Sir Oliver Letwin was a leading member of a government that foresaw a ""golden era"" of relations with China, with the UK as its ""best partner in the West"". Things have changed quite a bit since the then-chancellor George Osborne made this announcement in October 2015. China and the United States, often seen as the UK's firmest international ally, find themselves at loggerheads, loudly and seemingly daily, over issues as wide-ranging as Taiwan's future, human rights, trade and the balance of power in the South China Sea. Partly as a result of this, Sir Oliver, the former Cabinet Office minister, has spent a lot of time thinking about the the UK's place, and future role, in the world. ""We are very definitely in the third rank,"" says Sir Oliver, who campaigned against Brexit and was one of 21 Tory MPs to be expelled from the party for opposing Boris Johnson's plans. ""We're not the US or China. We're not India. We're not the EU."" But Sir Oliver - who has since returned to the Conservative fold but is no longer an MP - envisages the UK government working with the EU, Canada, Australia and New Zealand ""to exert, collectively, some influence"" over the US - the more accessible of the world's two superpowers - ""constantly attempting to make sure that the rhetoric is reduced to a calmer level"". It has been anything but calm recently. Joe Biden's government has angered Xi Jinping's by announcing a diplomatic boycott of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics over human rights issues, with China promising ""resolute counter-measures"". The US, UK and Australia have infuriated China by agreeing a security pact it views as an attempt to counter its influence in the hotly contested South China Sea. Add to this a disagreement over whether Taiwan should be independent of China, and the US accusing China of genocide against the Uighur population in the province of Xinjiang and undermining democracy in Hong Kong, and there is no doubt the situation is volatile. ""I'm not wildly optimistic,"" says Sir Oliver, a visiting professor at King's College London, as he contemplates relations between the US and China. ""On the current trajectory, we are heading pretty remorselessly into a cold war between America and China."" In his book China vs America: A Warning, he goes further, insisting China and the US must adopt a more friendly form of rivalry to avert a ""hot war"". They can start, he argues, by talking seriously about problems such as climate change and disease, which they, like all of humanity, share a common interest in preventing. But long-established institutions, such as the United Nations and International Monetary Fund, are inadequate, according to Sir Oliver. Reforming them would take ""ages"", so China and the West have to engage more immediately. ""I'm not claiming that that's certain to happen,"" says Sir Oliver, ""but it just seems to be a sensible thing to try, because I can't think of anything else that's at all likely to build up the basis of trust between the West and China."" Many analysts in Washington argue that authoritarian China wants to destroy liberal democracy through its economic influence - such as the Belt and Road Initiative building infrastructure between Asia and Europe - and an increasingly aggressive military. But Sir Oliver says the West often misunderstands China, whose primary aim is to restore what it regards as its rightful position as a world power following the ""aberration"" of the last 250 years, during which it has been largely subdued by the West. ""They expect to be treated with respect... and they don't expect institutions to kowtow to the United States."" The West should work to end ""the maintenance of China's periphery"", says Sir Oliver, in an effort to manage the ""conflicting ambition"" between China and US - that is, between gaining and retaining power. Sir Oliver says the G20 - a forum representing 20 leading economies, including China - shows promise, but the US must make a ""very, very big adjustment"" to no longer being the world's sole superpower. Due to censorship, the former MP's views will not be as readily available in China as in the West, but what advice does he offer its diplomats? ""It's extraordinarily important the Chinese recognise what a big adaptation this is for the United States and recognise how profound that difficulty is on the other side,"" he says. But many foreign policy thinkers would argue that the best - indeed, only - way to deal with China is not to show any weakness. Might not Sir Oliver's stance be taken by some as naive, placing too much onus on the West to change, without asking China to do the same?  Currently other Western nations are ""just sort of adhering to whatever Washington says, and being increasingly hawkish. So at the moment we are not performing the role [of influencing policy] at all,"" says Sir Oliver. ""You could imagine the UK having a settled diplomatic strategy of surrounding the US with friendly allies who were counselling involvement and engagement in these joint endeavours to solve the big problems the world faces."" Earlier this year the US State Department accused Mr Xi's government of genocide against the Uighur people, including the use of internment camps, forced labour and sterilisation. The UK government has announced it, like the US, will impose a diplomatic boycott of the Beijing Games. over this and other abuses. Several British MPs, including former Conservative leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith, have been placed under sanctions by Beijing after criticising the human rights record of Mr Xi's government. They argue the UK government must go further in its condemnation and actions. Sir Iain said recently that it ""now needs to stop messing around"", adding: ""The genocide taking place in Xinjiang has got to dominate our relationship with China."" The crackdown on democratic campaigners in Hong Kong, a former British colony, is seen by Sir Iain and others as a harbinger of the type of influence China might try to exert in other countries. But while he recognises that the West must continue to speak out over such behaviour, this does not deter Sir Oliver from arguing that dialogue is essential. ""We want to provide a continuing beacon of light on human rights everywhere,"" he says. ""But that shouldn't stop us from wanting to do business with them in the interest of humanity as a whole."""
Hawkish,Bird flu killed wild birds in south west England,2024-09-25,2020-11-11,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-gloucestershire-54901588,"Wild birds in three areas of south west England have died from bird flu.  Three wild geese found dead at the end of last month at the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust (WWT) at Slimbridge, Gloucestershire, tested positive for the H5N8 strain of avian influenza. Defra said swans that died near Dawlish, Devon and a wild goose in Weymouth, Dorset also tested positive. Public Health England (PHE) advice is that the risk to public health from the strain of the flu is ""very low"". WWT said it was working with the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA), PHE, and Gloucestershire County Council to monitor the situation.  The two greylag geese and one Canada goose were sent to APHA for testing, and results show they had the H5N8 strain of avian influenza. H5N8 is the same strain that infected a poultry farm in Frodsham, Cheshire earlier this month, and which has been found recently in Germany and the Netherlands. Chief veterinary officer, Christine Middlemiss, said it was ""important now more than ever"" for bird keepers ensure they ""maintain and strengthen good biosecurity... to ensure we prevent further outbreaks"". ""Public Health England has confirmed that the risk to public health is very low and the Food Standards Agency advises that bird flu poses a very low food safety risk for UK consumers. ""We ask that people continue to report findings of dead wild birds so that we can investigate the extent of infection."" A WWT spokesman said staff were following advice, research and a pre-prepared response plan, to ensure the wildlife and people at Slimbridge ""have the best protection"". The nature reserve has been closed to the public since 5 November in compliance with government coronavirus regulations for the four-week lockdown in England.  The risk level of avian influenza incursion in wild birds in Great Britain has been raised to ""high"" following the unrelated confirmed cases in Gloucestershire and Cheshire. Bird keepers have been urged to ""remain alert"" for any signs of disease, and report suspected disease immediately. Follow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Hawkish,Oscars body acts to boost diversity,2024-09-25,2018-06-26,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-44610003,"The group behind the prestigious Oscars film awards has invited 928 artists and executives to join the Academy Awards body - almost half of whom are women. Of those invited by the US Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, just over a third are from minorities. The move is part of a plan to double the number of women and ethnic minorities in the Academy by 2020. The recent #OscarsSoWhite and #MeToo movements criticised the body for its overwhelmingly white male membership. Among those invited to join the Academy as part of its push to become more diverse are female cinematographers from Mexico and France.  Other women stars on the list include US actors Jada Pinkett Smith, Amy Schumer, Ann Dowd and Christine Baranski, and the comedians Tiffany Haddish and Sarah Silverman. Listed notable male stars include African-American comedian Dave Chappelle, actor Daniel Kaluuya, who was nominated for an Oscar for his performance in Get Out, and French-American actor Timothée Chalamet, who starred in the film Call Me By Your Name. If all 928 of the Academy's invitations are accepted, female membership will rise to 31% from 28%, while ethnic minority members will increase to 16% from 13%, according to the academy. It would also raise the number of voting participants for the Oscars film awards to a new high of about 9,300 people, the New York Times reports.  Hollywood's awards seasons have been marked by controversy with the #MeToo campaign, which exposed and raised awareness of sexual harassment, and the #OscarsSoWhite movement. In 2016, actors including Marvel star Chadwick Boseman said they were inspired to join the Academy because of the strength of the #OscarsSoWhite diversity campaign, which began with a tweet by activist film producer Rita Wilson. ""I felt obligated to join,"" said Boseman, who plays superhero Black Panther in the Marvel films. Wilson said at the time that it was right to join because the Academy was now ""open to hearing what the issues were""."
Hawkish,Film review: Furious 7,2024-09-25,2015-03-25,Nicholas Barber,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20150325-furious-7-running-on-empty,"The late Paul Walker’s final installment of the Fast & Furious franchise opens soon in cinemas – but the movie may make you carsick, writes critic Nicholas Barber. Maybe it’s appropriate for a film in which so many super-charged hot-rods make screeching U-turns, but Furious 7 never stops swerving recklessly between two very different moods. Just when you’re settling into a proudly silly action movie, somebody will make a grave speech about the importance of family. Then, just when you think that it’s actually a sober film set in the real world, someone will drive a car out of a plane and land safely on a mountain road several thousand feet below. And then, just when you’ve accepted that it’s a Road Runner cartoon with added tattoos, a sombre scene will remind you that one of its stars, Paul Walker, died while the film was in production. The tonal lurches are so extreme that some viewers are bound to get whiplash. The first film in the series, 2001’s The Fast and the Furious, was a relatively plausible thriller about an FBI agent (Walker) going undercover in a gang of illegal street racers. But every sequel has been bigger and dafter than the one before, and we’ve now got to the stage where Furious 7 is a cross between Tom Cruise’s Mission: Impossible franchise and Sylvester Stallone’s The Expendables. Like Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol, it’s a high-tech global espionage caper featuring lots of computer hacking and a skyscraper in the United Arab Emirates. And like The Expendables, it is a dopey buddy movie packed with trigger-happy action heroes: in this instalment, Kurt Russell, Tony Jaa and Jason Statham (an Expendable himself) join a musclebound roster that already includes Vin Diesel, Dwayne Johnson and Michelle Rodriguez. Put those two franchises together and you get a film so extravagantly ludicrous that it could easily be a parody of Hollywood’s adolescent excesses. The majority of the dialogue consists of trailer-friendly, macho slogans; the male characters have biceps that would put the Hulk to shame; the female characters are usually filmed at buttock-level as they strut away from the camera in bikinis; and the plotting is head-achingly stupid, right from the opening scene. But nothing in the film is as preposterous as the digitally-enhanced action sequences, all of which ignore the laws of physics. Again and again, cars are smashed through glass walls, perforated with bullets, and thrown downward at breakneck speed, and yet the drivers are always fine and dandy. Even more remarkably, no innocent bystanders are affected by the destruction. In the explosion-heavy finale, much of downtown Los Angeles is razed, but someone seems to have had the foresight to evacuate the city first. Need for speed This logic-free, consequence-free property damage is never very involving. Once Diesel’s character has driven his car over the edge of a cliff, only to emerge at the bottom without a scratch, it’s safe to assume that alien invaders could obliterate the planet and he would walk away unscathed. (Something to look forward to in Fast & Furious 8, perhaps.) But if you are partial to amoral, petrolhead mayhem, there is no doubt that Furious 7 delivers the goods. It races from set piece to outrageous set piece at a pedal-to-the-metal pace, and the gleeful verve of the action just about compensates for its senselessness. The snag is, though, that the film isn’t satisfied with being a numbskulled, testosterone-drenched fantasy. It insists on being a mushy sermon on the virtues of friendship and domesticity, too. Like The Expendables and its sequels, it spends most of its running time trivialising violence, and its remaining minutes being sentimental about the heroes’ brotherly bonds. The death of one gang member is treated as an agonizing crime against humanity, and whenever Walker’s character talks to his wife (Jordana Brewster), their exchanges are so morbid and mawkish that you would think he had been diagnosed with a terminal illness. The film keeps telling us that we shouldn’t take any of it seriously, but it also keeps telling us that we should take it very seriously indeed. This flip-flopping would be jarring enough in any circumstances, but it’s especially painful in the wake of Walker’s death in a car accident in 2013. The screenplay was rewritten, and his scenes were rejigged, so that the film would serve as an emotional farewell to the actor and the character. And while the frequent references to his demise verge on the ghoulish, they certainly have the desired effect. At the screening I attended, the final valedictory montage had grown men wiping their eyes. But there’s no getting away from the horrible irony that Walker died in a Porsche being driven at twice the speed limit. And there’s no denying the hypocrisy of a film that is both a tear-jerking tribute to a star killed by dangerous driving, and a meat-headed farce which asserts that dangerous driving is no riskier than a game of hopscotch. Furious 7 is sure to be the most lucrative entry of the series. But if you give it any thought at all, it will leave you feeling carsick. ★★☆☆☆ If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter."
Hawkish,The strange beauty of lost rubbish,2024-09-25,2016-04-04,Stuart Haygarth,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20160324-stuart-haygarths-strand-the-strange-beauty-of-lost-rubbish,"When Stuart Haygarth walked the south coast of England, he collected each man-made object he found – and the surprisingly stunning photographs that resulted are collected in a new book. In February 2011, the British artist Stuart Haygarth set off on a 500-mile journey along England's southern coast. His goal: to pick up every single man-made object that he found along the way. These discarded items – shoes, combs, lighters – are what most of us would call rubbish. But the pieces he made from them, including both installations and carefully composed photographs, turn them into art. Now out in a new book, Strand, these photographs ""make strange again the mass-produced objects that fill our lives to the degree that we scarcely perceive them"", Robert Macfarlane writes in the introduction. This excerpt from the book follows Haygarth along the coast through his journal entries. Day 1 Allhallows-on-Sea My journey started with a weekend trip in February 2011 to test the water and to get a taste of things to come. I set off from east London in my 1982 VW camper van, which would be my lodgings for the duration of the trip. The walk began in Allhallows-on-Sea on the Hoo Peninsula in Kent, beside the Allhallows Leisure Park, along lines of permanent static caravans and rows of regimented prefabricated wooden cabins. Further along the coast towards Grain, huge industrial factories belched out grey smoke. The landscape turned marshy, with several tributaries leading to the Thames estuary. I was soon to discover, two hours into this first walk, that estuaries are obstacles best to avoid. A trolley modified to hold all the objects that I would collect turned out to be more of a hindrance than a help: its wheels clogged in clay soil, and the many gates I had to climb meant it became unwieldy and cumbersome. On the horizon, I saw a steady stream of gigantic cargo ships pass by on the Thames. Day 2 Sheerness The beach begins with shingle and endless rows of groyns installed to prevent longshore drift. There are groups of Sunday dog walkers on the early stretch of coast because there is a safe concrete promenade. At regular intervals, artificial wooden benches are positioned with personal family memorial plaques, several displaying withered bunches of flowers. There are no people beyond the promenade because from here the beach becomes wet and muddy with heavy soil. I discover a couple of shipwrecks resembling the carcasses of beached whales, just the decaying hulls remaining. Rusty vehicle components lie partially buried in the ground. An enormous tractor tyre tipped on its side has become a miniature swimming pool brimming with seawater. On my right-hand side are steep, intimidating clay cliffs showing signs of wet mudslides after weeks of heavy rain. My plywood box is completely full and I struggle like a pit pony through the sticky mud. I decide that a carrying system on my back will be much more efficient than the trolley. Day 4 Margate Walking at the base of vertical chalky cliffs for most of the day, I had to focus my attention on the tide and exit points. The beaches were deserted because of the overcast day and strong winds. Margate is like a ghost town, symbol of a bygone age of British beach holidays. Boarded-up and decaying buildings with a series of seawater-filled lidos from a different era. The coast walls are covered in chalk graffiti, chunks of chalk littering the promenade. Walking around the belly of the Isle of Thanet, I soon reached Broadstairs with its cute harbour, boats, brightly painted beach huts and an old-style fun fair. The beach defences were coated in a myriad of green hues and textures resembling large canvases of abstract art. I found little of interest to collect but stumbled across a long pink plastic penis wedged in between some rocks on the cliff face. It turned out to be a novelty straw, which made me smile and feel like an archaeologist discovering an ancient drinking implement. Day 9 Greatstone-on-Sea The sun had brought families to the beach. Cricket, kite-flying and land yachting were in progress. I noticed a sign warning of an infestation of brown-tail moth caterpillars, and sure enough I could see hundreds from where I was standing. A moat with a lonely chair was left from the previous day’s play. I walked past a flimsy wooden fence laden with pieces of rubbish, carefully positioned to create some kind of totem. The sand changed to wide-open shingle with hardy vegetation growing in scattered clumps. The area around Dungeness is an intriguing and surreal mix: old fishermen’s huts, 1970s retirement homes and newly designed iroko-clad modernist weekend retreats are overlooked by the gigantic and imposing nuclear power station. Beyond here, the coast becomes yet another danger area, a military playground barren apart from abandoned tanks and lookout posts. This area was a treasure trove for flotsam and jetsam. My rucksack was crammed with objects, heavy and cumbersome. I arrived exhausted at Camber Holiday Park and phoned for a taxi to take me back to the camper van. Ten minutes later, I was speeding towards Littlestone with a speed freak lady driver. She moaned about everything – the royal wedding, other drivers, her injured ankle – all except her love of driving. Day 16 Hayling Island Today was the first rainy day of my walk, so I reluctantly swapped my shorts for a pair of waterproof trousers. Hayling Island does not quite live up to its rather seductive name: amusement arcades, fast-food kiosks and not much else. Even the gale could not deter the many golfers, still going strong. As I walked west along Stokes Bay, the sun came out and my damp clothes began to dry. Southampton Water is a popular sailing area, with small yachts bouncing around on the swell, a stark contrast to the gigantic cruise ships that slowly creep by. I was soon walking through the former Browndown army training camp and nature reserve, which was great for collecting objects. The area had a series of large concrete mushroom structures, no doubt linked to the military in some way. In the distance, I could see the industrial skyline of Southampton and a refinery with smoking chimneys, the smell of oil in the salty air. Tonight there was a full moon over the Solent with views across to the Isle of Wight. I fell asleep to the sound of the wind and the van rocking. Day 26 Dawlish Warren At Dawlish, the train tracks hug the Devon coastline, sandwiched in between the sculpted terracotta sandstone cliffs. Today was mainly cliff-top walking, with access to very few beaches. The idyllic coves that I managed to find were clean, so my rucksack remained light. At Teignmouth, I had to circumnavigate the estuary by heading inland to cross over a bridge, adding a couple of miles to my journey. At St Marychurch, I stopped for a short rest. Dog owners threw sticks for their pets, which returned them swiftly, hungry for more play. A small Yorkshire terrier sniffed curiously at my rucksack on the grass and nonchalantly urinated on it before I had a chance to react. The owner apologised, smiled and walked away. The sun was setting as I entered Torbay. I passed rows of luxurious houses with spectacular sea views; tourists were out in force drinking by the harbour. The taxi driver who returned me to the van was a curious-looking character, a tiny man of boyish proportions but with thinning white hair. The film The Curious Tale of Benjamin Button sprang to mind. I had noticed there were many German tourists in Torquay; the driver explained that it was because Fawlty Towers was set and filmed there: they came in search of Basil Fawlty. Day 38 Land’s End Constant hard rain and wind. My right boot is letting in water because the seal has broken near the heel, so my foot squelches. There are huge crashing waves, attracting thrill-seeking surfers. Absolutely no one is walking the South West Coast Path today. On a small beach, I found what looked like a decapitated shark with chunks bitten from its torso. I passed the remains of solid stone towers and buildings left from the slate-mining days. Collecting was good, probably due to the recent stormy weather. At Porthcurno, I visited the open-air Minack Theatre, founded by the visionary Rowena Cade, who created a Greek-style amphitheatre on the slope of the cliff face. The light was failing as I reached Land’s End and the skies were dramatic and painterly. Land’s End itself was disappointing. On my arrival, I was confronted with a gigantic car park that was empty apart from two camper vans. In typical vulgar style, there was an array of amusement arcades, gift shops and a cinema showing undersea movies; further along, there was a pub and a charmless modern hotel. I felt melancholy mixed with pleasure at having achieved my goal. Extracted from Strand by Stuart Haygarth, published by Art / Books.

Hawkish,Why we've got The Godfather wrong,2024-09-25,2022-03-14,Nicholas Barber,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20220311-the-godfather-have-we-misunderstood-americas-greatest-film,"Fifty years after its premiere, Francis Ford Coppola's classic gangster movie is still considered one of the greatest artworks made about the US, but have we overlooked a key element, asks Nicholas Barber. Fancy watching The Godfather? It's an offer that most of us can't refuse. Adapted from Mario Puzo's bestselling novel, Francis Ford Coppola's gangster saga came second in BBC Culture's 2015 critics poll to find the 100 greatest American films, and there aren't many such lists that don't have it in the top 10. Fifty years on from its release in March 1972, it stands as the defining US artwork not just on organised crime, but on immigration, capitalism and corruption. Even people who aren't familiar with the film can recognise Marlon Brando's weary, wheezy Mafia boss, Vito Corleone, and his favourite son Michael, played by Al Pacino. They can also quote or misquote its most memorable lines – including the one at the top of this paragraph. And its aficionados know it off by heart. In You've Got Mail, Tom Hanks cites it as the source of all wisdom. (""What is it about The Godfather?"" sighs Meg Ryan.) The characters in The Sopranos are such enthusiasts that they name their strip club Bada Bing! after another of its lines.   More like this: -        The monster who terrifies, 100 years on -        The 1971 western that celebrated male intimacy -        The ancient roots of Catwoman Still, the fact that The Godfather should be so easily associated with a strip club raises the contentious issue of its female characters. The running time is three hours, and yet, to quote the Chicago Sun-Times' critic, Roger Ebert: ""There is little room for women in The Godfather."" Some critics have gone further. Molly Haskell wrote in the New York Times in 1997 that ""Coppola's film demeans and demotes women outrageously"". They have a point. There are no women in The Godfather as ferocious as Michelle Pfeiffer's Elvira Hancock in Scarface (1983), or Kathleen Turner and Anjelica Huston's characters in Prizzi's Honor (1985). While Vito, Michael and his brothers get to make deals and plan murders, pour drinks and eat Chinese takeaways, the women in their lives are left to hold the baby. The film is, among other things, a movie about hanging with your bros. Or, as David Thomson put it in Esquire magazine in 2021: ""It is a movie about happiness and feeling good. And guys get it. Always have."" Providing ""the most exultant glimpse of male nature in American film"", The Godfather, Thomson writes, revolves around ""work, order, and the making of decisions"". But it would be unfair to say that the film itself ignores women, even if the men in it so often do. In fact, Coppola keeps reminding us where the female characters are and how they are feeling. The opening speech is about a girl who has been abused, the closing scene has two women questioning and protesting against Michael's methods. The most disturbingly violent sequence has Vito's pregnant daughter Connie (Talia Shire) being whipped by her husband. And when Hollywood mogul Jack Woltz (John Marley) holds forth about a ""young"", ""innocent"" starlet, who ""was the greatest piece of ass I've ever had"", Coppola positions a maid in the background, forced to stand and listen to his misogynistic rant. As for the male Corleones' neglect of their wives and sisters, well, let's not forget that The Godfather is set in the 1940s and 1950s. As much as we may enjoy the performances of Shelley Winters in Roger Corman's Bloody Mama (1970) and Madonna in Warren Beatty's Dick Tracy (1990), Coppola rejects the idea that mid-century Mafia women were pistol-packing molls, scheming femme fatales, or matriarchs doted on by a crowd of momma's boys. Instead, he insists, they were more likely to be pushed aside by their sexist men, who were steeped in blood and betrayal. The Godfather isn't a monument to male chauvinism, but a condemnation of it. And it's all too relevant, half a century after its release. When Vito attends an all-male meeting of Mafia bosses, the boardroom table is identical to those in countless photos of cabinet meetings and corporate conferences today. Cutting off female influence Besides, even though the men drive the plot in The Godfather, the women are vitally important to it. The bravura opening sequence is set at Connie's wedding banquet in the Corleones' family compound. Vito spends most of it in his shadowy study, fielding entreaties from his supplicants (an old Sicilian wedding tradition, apparently), and the dialogue keeps returning to the subject of masculinity. When Vito's top enforcer, Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana), thanks the boss for his wedding invitation, he offers the bride and groom this faltering blessing: ""And I hope that their first child be a masculine child."" Michael has a different perspective – at first, anyway. A decorated World War Two veteran, he brings his girlfriend Kay (Diane Keaton) to the wedding, shares the Corleones' darkest secrets with her, and insists on her being included in a family photograph. But the trajectory charted by the film is his arc away from Kay and towards damnation. ""[Women] will be saints in heaven while we men burn in hell,"" says Vito in Puzo's novel, and Coppola seems to agree. The first time we see Michael and Kay after the wedding, they are on a snowy Christmas shopping spree which could be a scene from a romantic comedy, but when Vito is wounded in a shooting, the real casualty is the couple's closeness. Michael can no longer tell her he loves her while his associates are listening, and he leaves the hotel room where they're having dinner to tend to his father. ""I'm with you now,"" he whispers in Vito's ear.  There is a glimmering chance of redemption when Michael hides out in Sicily and falls for a peasant girl, Apollonia (Simonetta Stefanelli), who dares to challenge him. When he first lays eyes on her, she turns and strides away, and after they are married, she is confident enough to mock him and chide him. Coppola puts her behind the wheel of her husband’s car – literally in the driving seat. Could Michael settle down with a companion who is his trusted equal? Of course not. Apollonia is killed, and Michael returns to the US and the family business – no longer a smiling, tender war hero, but a reptilian tyrant who orders multiple murders, lies about them to his nearest and dearest, and professes to reject Satan at a baptism while his enemies are gunned down. By this stage, ""I hope that their first child be a masculine child,"" sounds more like a curse than a blessing. Michael also reunites with Kay, but his marriage proposal is no longer the stuff of romantic comedies. While Apollonia was in the driving seat, the tearful Kay is ushered into the back of a chauffeur-driven car. You could easily mistake the scene for a kidnapping. In Puzo's novel, Kay is willing to accept her place in the Corleone crime syndicate, but the film's famous ending has Michael's study door being closed in her distraught face so that he can strategise with his lieutenants in private. She is separated from him, just as Vito's wife (Morgana King) was all through the film. That's what being a Mafia boss means, it seems: being cut off from female influence. None of this proves that the film is feminist, exactly: Coppola is too reverential towards its martyred women for that. In a Sight and Sound interview from 1972, reprinted in the current issue, he waxes lyrical about ""a kind of feminine, magical quality, dating back to the Virgin Mary or something I picked up in catechism classes, that fascinates me"". And it's true that he never paints the female Corleones in shades of grey. Kay, Apollonia and Vito's wife never condone their husbands' crimes, and Connie is banished to an apartment in New York after her wedding. It's as if Coppola can't bear the thought that they might be complicit in the men's nefarious deeds. But his approach in The Godfather doesn't ""demean or demote"" women so much as it places them on a pedestal. You wouldn’t want many gangster films to have such angelic female characters. We are lucky to have had Lorraine Bracco as Karen Hill in Goodfellas (1990) and Sharon Stone as Ginger McKenna in Casino (1995), for example, as well as a new wave of female-led mob movies. In 2019's The Kitchen, Melissa McCarthy, Tiffany Haddish and Elisabeth Moss took over their husbands' rackets in late-1970s New York. Jennifer Lopez is due to play Griselda Blanco, a Colombian drug dealer, in The Godmother. And Jennifer Lawrence has signed on to star in Mob Girl as Arlyne Brickman, a gangster turned government witness. These films may be a necessary corrective to The Godfather, but Coppola put more thought than most male writer-directors into what happens when women are excluded from men's lives. After The Godfather Part II – in which Kay abandons Michael – his next film was his 1979 Vietnam War masterpiece, Apocalypse Now (also featuring Marlon Brando). Again, there are almost no women in it, and, again, the women who are in it are archetypes rather than nuanced characters. But, again, they are clearly on Coppola's mind, in scenes ranging from the Playboy bunnies' calamitous show for the troops, to the killing of ""Mr Clean"" (Laurence Fishburne) while he is listening to a recording of his mother's voice.  As in The Godfather, the hollow left by absent women has been filled with blood. In the extended ""Redux"" edit of Apocalypse Now, which Coppola completed in 2001, Martin Sheen's Willard spends a night with a widow (Aurore Clémont) on a French plantation, who tells him: ""There are two of you, don't you see? One that kills and one that loves."" Just like Michael Corleone in Sicily, he glimpses how life could be if he was one that loves rather than one that kills. But the next morning he returns to his mission on the Stygian river, on a journey away from humanity and into the heart of darkness.   Love film and TV?

Hawkish,The Rings of Power is 'staggering',2024-09-25,2022-08-31,Stephen Kelly,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20220830-rings-of-power-review-a-visually-staggering-but-flawed-epic,"The Lord of the Rings prequel is Amazon's most expensive show to date – but can it be the hit the streamer needs? On the basis of two episodes, the jury's out, writes Stephen Kelly. It is a curious quirk of fate that The Rings of Power, a Lord of the Rings prequel based on the histories of a fictional world, written by JRR Tolkien, should premiere two weeks after House of the Dragon, a Game of Thrones prequel based on the histories of a fictional world written by George RR Martin. More like this: –      The ancient roots of Lord of the Rings –      Did Tolkien write 'juvenile trash'? –      House of the Dragon is 'pure Game of Thrones' Martin, of course, famously wrote Game of Thrones as a reaction to The Lord of the Rings, with the aim of turning its heroic tale of good versus evil into something grittier and real (""what was Aragorn's tax policy?"" he once asked). While The Rings of Power, Amazon Prime's biggest, most expensive show to date, seems to have been created as a reaction to Game of Thrones, with seemingly every streamer of recent years desperate to emulate its success. Based on its first two episodes, the result is fantasy television of unparalleled grandeur – one more suited to cinema screens than laptops and TVs – with a world that is vividly realised, and a plot that, while undeniably uneven, is charged with a soaring sense of mythic lyricism. Developed by showrunners JD Payne and Patrick McKay, relative newcomers in the world of screenwriting, The Rings of Power is largely adapted from the immense backstory found in the appendices of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy. It is set in the Second Age of Middle-earth, thousands of years before the adventures of Frodo and the Fellowship, and – as we're told in solemn voiceover by Morfydd Clark's Galadriel – centuries after a great war between Morgoth, a godlike being of supreme evil, and the elves. It tells the sprawling story of how the sorcerer Sauron, a once-devoted servant of Morgoth, first rose to power through the forging of the 19 rings, which he secretly controlled through the One Ring (Gollum's ""precious""). The Rings of Power is the passion project of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, who in recent years has become a contentious symbol of billionaire decadence. The rights alone cost $250 million. In a Vanity Fair article published earlier this year, it was reported that the first season cost $462 million to make (to contrast, the first season of Amazon's other big fantasy series, The Wheel of Time, cost $80 million). In the end, expenditure for marketing and subsequent seasons will likely push the entire project past $1bn, which would make it the costliest show ever made. So far, that money burns right through the screen. For a television series, the production values are staggering. The sets feel huge and lived-in, the costumes are beautiful and intricate, and the digital effects are sharper than most movies. Because of rights issues, The Rings of Power cannot brand itself as a prequel to Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings films, but the family resemblance is uncanny. Just take the scope and scale of its shooting in New Zealand, whose sweeping vistas and idyllic greenery were first favoured by Jackson. This time they are utilised by, among others, JA Bayona, best known for directing the underrated Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, who takes charge of the first two episodes of the eight-episode series made available for review.  Just as it did in the LOTR films, New Zealand's scenery grounds the story in a place that manages to feel both authentic and unearthly. There is also a fluid elegance to how on-location shots and practical sets are blended with digital backdrops, which carry an almost painterly quality to their design. This especially goes for many of the scenes involving the elves, which tend to be bathed in beautiful, ethereal light. Compared to Jackson's trilogy, which had a more textured, characterful look, this shine can give The Rings of Power a chilly quality at times, almost as though it is too clean, too immaculate. It is undeniable, however, that in purely aesthetic terms, this is the closest a TV show has come to blurring the lines between television and cinema – even if, narratively, it is a rather ponderous version of the former so far. As the story begins, Galadriel is the only one who believes that Sauron, who killed her brother, is not only still alive, but is building an army of Orcs in secret. Most viewers will recognise Galadriel from Peter Jackson's trilogy, where she is played as the epitome of Elven wisdom by Cate Blanchett. Here, thousands of years younger, she is a rougher prospect: brasher, angrier, and played with steely conviction by Clark, who anchors the show with an authoritative, commanding performance; little surprise to anyone who saw her blistering turn in 2019 horror Saint Maud.  Galadriel is determined to find Sauron, but is being held back by her fellow elves. A young Elrond (played by Robert Aramayo) thinks that her obsession has gone too far. ""Evil does not sleep, Elrond,"" she tells him. ""It waits until the moment of our complacency, it blinds us."" Elrond himself has a task. He has been ordered by the Elven king to assist the legendary smith – and future creator of the rings – Celebrimbor (Charles Edwards) on a special project, which will take him to the spectacular realm of the dwarves. While across the map – and yes, there is a map – we are introduced to the Southlands, where tensions between elves and men run high, and the Rhovanion, where Nori (Markella Kavenagh), part of the tiny breed of Harfoots who are a kind of Irish variant of the Hobbits, yearns for adventure – right before it falls from the sky. The first episode struggles slightly under the weight of establishing the world and setting up all of its threads; some of which are more interesting than others. The forbidden romance between Elf Arondir (Ismael Cruz Córdova) and human Bronwyn (Nazanin Boniadi) in the Southlands, for example, is quite flat in comparison with Galadriel's compelling mission of revenge. The Harfoots, meanwhile, straddle a thin line between charming and mawkish, although the charm wins out in the end thanks to a scene-stealing performance from Kavenagh, and a joyful appearance from Lenny Henry as a Harfoot elder. (It should also be noted that Henry is one of many black actors in the cast: a welcome update to the unfortunate racial optics of Jackson's trilogy). The second episode is snappier and more engrossing. There's a thrilling (and again, impressively epic) sequence set at sea, while much of the show's early levity comes through a wonderful set of scenes between Elrond and his old dwarven friend Durin (Owain Arthur), who is upset at the Middle-earth equivalent of Elrond having left him on read. This episode also announces The Rings of Power as quite a different prospect to The Hobbit or The Lord of the Rings. Rather than a hero's journey, this is a slower, more granular tale, which can at times suffer from the prequel urge to fill in backstory – much like an appendix. As is often the case with prequels, seeing what already happened in the past is not as interesting as pushing a plot forward (the exceptions, such as Better Call Saul, tend to negate that by going in-depth on character). Unlike, say, Game of Thrones, the characters of The Rings of Power are more archetypal, more traditionally mythic. This is not to say that Game of Thrones is better because it is more subversive: Tolkien and Martin merely inhabit two different realms of fantasy. Game of Thrones is engrossing because of its complicated characters and challenging morals; The Lord of the Rings, while not a simple tale of good and evil (remember Boromir?) is arguably more poetic in tone, and ultimately more moving in nature. The first two episodes of The Rings of Power occupy an awkward space where it's not yet apparent if either of these approaches apply to it – its characters have not yet revealed themselves as complex, while it's too early to tell if it will rebottle the catharsis of Tolkien's work or Peter Jackson's movies. Yet what does make it work so far is what made The Lord of the Rings work: the earnestness of its performances, and the sincerity of its writing. Showrunners JD Payne and Patrick McKay may have come from nowhere to develop The Rings of Power, but they display a deft understanding of Tolkien's soothing rhythms, his grandeur and musicality. It's a pleasure to hear the characters talk. There are reports that The Rings of Power will determine the future of Amazon's streaming strategy. Whether it will be the hit that Amazon Prime needs it to be – considering the amount of money that it costs – remains to be seen. Based on the first two episodes, the signs are promising – but maybe promising is not enough when expectations are this high. Either way, there is no doubting the scale of the show's ambition, or its dedication to the soul and substance of Tolkien's work. For a TV show that is essentially the newest play-toy of a billionaire, it is surprisingly bold stuff. ★★★★☆ The first two episode of Rings of Power premiere on Amazon Prime on 2 September, with subsequent episodes following weekly  Love film and TV?

Hawkish,The brilliant women the Oscars ignored,2024-09-25,2020-01-13,BBC Culture Editors,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20200113-how-could-the-oscars-ignore-these-brilliant-women-directors,"Yet again, the Academy have produced an all-male best director shortlist. Here are some of the incredible female filmmakers that could – and should – have broken up the boys’ club. The most memorable single moment of yesterday’s Oscar nominations came not from any single inclusion or exclusion, but from presenter Issa Rae’s deliciously pointed statement “congratulations to those men” on introducing the Best Director shortlist. Yes, that’s right, yet again, for the 87th time in the Oscars’ 92-year history, no space could be found in the category for a single woman – a fact all the more egregious when you consider the depth and breadth of films directed by women this year. So, as a correction to this, here’s our list of this year’s great female directors, any of whom more than merited a nod:  Waad Al-Kateab, For Sama This documentary about the horrors of the Syrian civil war has rightly been getting a good spread of awards recognition, receiving four Bafta nominations – the most ever for a documentary – as well as an Oscar nod in that category. But frankly, the achievement of its co-director Al-Kateab is so extraordinary that she deserves even greater credit. For those who don’t know: Al-Kateab was a student living in Aleppo as it became a chief battleground in the war, who filmed her experiences over five years, as a nascent journalist, the wife of a doctor running a volunteer hospital, and the mother of a young daughter. The film that emerges from her footage (assembled and edited with her co-director Edward Watts) depicts the effects of war with unparalleled detail and nuance, and leaves you marvelling equally at Al-Kateab’s bravery and self-taught skill. Direction simply doesn’t get more vital than this. (Hugh Montgomery) Claire Denis, High Life It was excellent (if expected) to see South Korea’s Bong Joon Ho among the best director nominees for the exquisite social horror Parasite, but we would have loved to have seen another magisterially strange non-US auteur in contention: that French cinematic legend Claire Denis, whose first English-language film was an especially twisted take on the space movie about a vessel of prisoners on a journey into a black hole. Unsurprisingly, given its maverick creator, it eschews the usual cod-spiritual cliches for a fascinating corporeality that includes Juliette Binoche as a breeding-fixated doctor, and a lot of bodily fluids. One can only hope we get a Denis spin on more mainstream movie genres. (HM) Mati Diop, Atlantics When Diop’s debut premiered at Cannes last year, she became the first ever black female director to have a film in competition at the festival. But even if you knew nothing about its director (who starred in Claire Denis’ 35 Shots of Rum), it was thrillingly unique. Beginning as an angry social-realist chronicle of the rich exploiting the poor in Dakar, Senegal, the film transforms itself, magically, into a spine-tingling supernatural fable without sacrificing any of its conviction. Diop seems to re-invent two different genres in one go. (Nicholas Barber) Greta Gerwig, Little Women Ignoring Gerwig’s direction of this stunning film is the most baffling and outrageous omission this year. Her bold restructuring of the classic novel is timely in its feminist undercurrent, emotionally real thanks to its richly played characters (at least Saoirse Ronan and Florence Pugh got nominations), and visually beautiful in every frame. It's even a commercial hit, earning more than $100m (£77m) globally so far. The film is up for best picture and Gerwig was nominated for adapted screenplay (often the consolation-prize category). What more do Oscars voters want? Giving Todd Phillips a director’s nod for Joker instead of Gerwig just shrieks ‘Boys Club’. As she demonstrated with Lady Bird, Gerwig is an amazingly self-assured filmmaker, so she'll be fine. The snub suggests that Hollywood is not. (Caryn James)   Marielle Heller, A Beautiful Day in the Neighbourhood In only three films, including the sharp and knowing Diary of a Teenage Girl, and the droll Can You Ever Forgive Me?, Heller has created a record astonishing for any filmmaker. Directing beloved superstar Tom Hanks, the stakes were even higher this year, and she came through by leading him to a supporting-actor nomination as US children’s entertainer Mr Rogers, allowing the full complexity of the character to shine through his goody-goody image. Heller brings unusual intelligence and flair to mainstream films. Why doesn’t she get more credit? One reason may be that she makes it all look so smooth and deceptively easy. (CJ) Joanna Hogg, The Souvenir Hogg’s films are so distinctive that the adjective Hoggian should be added to the cinema-studies lexicon. No one else scrutinises the privileged but angst-addled English upper-middle class with such a clear, unblinking eye. Her most uncomfortably honest film so far is The Souvenir, an autobiographical coming-of-age drama about a naive film student (Honor Swinton Byrne) and her outwardly respectable but heroin-addicted boyfriend (Tom Burke), Anthony. The Souvenir may be set in the 1980s, but in Anthony’s prickly condescension, leeching sense of entitlement and distancing ironic humour, you can learn a lot about today’s British politicians. (NB) Jennifer Kent, The Nightingale The Babadook was one of the most nerve-fraying horror films of the last decade, but not even that could prepare audiences for Kent’s ambitious follow-up, a staggering wilderness revenge thriller which also succeeds as an important, far-reaching examination of Australia’s grisly colonial history. The protagonists are an Irishwoman and an Aboriginal Tasmanian who hunt down the English soldiers who murdered the woman’s husband and baby. No, it’s not an easy watch, but The Nightingale is an epic which doesn’t waste a moment of its two-and-a-quarter-hour running time. A major work of world cinema. (NB) Melina Matsoukas, Queen & Slim Queen & Slim is Matsoukas’s first feature, but her background as the director of audacious, stunning videos, including Beyonce’s Formation, is evident. This daring film is a road movie, a crime story and a romance, all embedded in a deep sense of social injustice, while Daniel Kaluuya and Jodie Turner-Smith engage us with their characters, two apparently mismatched people on the run after accidentally killing a white policeman. With stunning images, bright colours and sweeping camera work, Matsoukas’s drama displays a vision that is uncompromising in its mix of art and social awareness. Hers is just the kind of singular voice the movie world needs. (CJ) Sacha Polak, Dirty God Dirty God tells the sad, funny, inspirational story of a young working-class woman (Vicky Knight) who fights to rebuild her identity after being badly scarred in an acid attack. Balancing the gorgeously poetic with the heart-rendingly grim, the political with the intimately personal, Dirty God confirms that its director, Polak, is an exceptional talent. For one thing, she is Dutch, and this is her first English-language film, but her portrayal of London council-estate life is as detailed and believable as any insider’s account. (NB) Lorene Scafaria, Hustlers There has been entirely justified bafflement at J-Lo’s definitive star performance being ignored in the best supporting actress category, but frankly, we should all be just as furious at the complete omission of Hustlers full stop. Based on the true story of the New York stripper crew who drugged and fleeced their Wall Street clientele, it is a more interesting, far less familiar crime film than The Irishman, and an inestimably more intelligent inquiry into class divisions than Joker. And Scafaria’s direction of it, with its reconfiguration of the strip-club space through the female gaze, is absolutely central to its singular force within Hollywood cinema this year. (HM) Céline Sciamma, Portrait of a Lady on Fire Sciamma’s gritty third film, Girlhood, was set in a tough African-French neighbourhood on the edge of present-day Paris. For her fourth film, she jumped to a country chateau in the 18th Century, and yet the results are just as urgent and assured. A slow-burning romance between an aristocrat and the artist who is hired to paint her, Portrait of a Lady on Fire looks as bright and attractive as any traditional frocks-and-carriages period drama, but it is stealthily radical, doing without male characters altogether, and eschewing action in favour of the thoughts and feelings of women for whom arranged marriages are a fact of life. A game-changer.  (NB)  Lulu Wang, The Farewell Wang's comic drama, based on her own family history, feels so true and personal that it’s possible to overlook how ambitious and brilliantly accomplished it is. The story is intimate, as a young Chinese-American (Awkwafina, whose acting snub is another outrage) travels to China to see her dying grandma, the entire family hiding that reality from the sly old woman. Yet Wang's scope is huge. She captures the textures of New York and China, along with their broad cultural differences. And she modulates the tone perfectly. The film is funny and emotional yet never mawkish. The Farewell won’t get Wang an Oscar, but it has launched her career in dazzling fashion. (CJ) Olivia Wilde, Booksmart  In her very funny  first film as director, Wilde transforms the buddy movie, with Beanie Feldstein and Kaitlyn Dever as studious best friends who decide to party through the night. Booksmart is not a girls’ version of a boys-misbehaving movie, though. It’s a film about female friendship that is by turns hilarious, absurdist and touching. Throughout, Wilde’s comic timing is impeccable. She handles raucous set pieces – like a druggy hallucination involving dolls, and small-scale conversation, in which the heroines share the kind of insecurities and confidences that best friends do – with equal skill. Exuding talent and confidence, Wilde brings a fresh voice to familiar tropes. (CJ) Love film? Join BBC Culture Film Club on Facebook, a community for film fanatics all over the world.

Hawkish,‘Little Women is a triumph’,2024-09-25,2019-12-16,Caryn James,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20191216-why-little-women-is-a-triumph,"Greta Gerwig’s new adaptation brings a contemporary vision to the 19th-Century novel that should be considered a classic in its own right, writes Caryn James. Little Women Director: Greta Gerwig Cast: Saoirse Ronan, Emma Watson, Timothée Chalamet, Florence Pugh, Eliza Scanlen, Laura Dern, Meryl Streep Run-time: 134 mins Release date: 25 December 2019 in the US and Canada and 26 December in the UK and Brazil There is a guilty secret shared by more readers than you might imagine: some of us have never been fond of that preachy novel Little Women. It is a minority opinion to be sure: generations of women writers from Simone de Beauvoir to JK Rowling and Patti Smith have declared that they were inspired by Louisa May Alcott's 19th-Century book, especially her strong-willed, semi-autobiographical heroine, Jo. More like this: -       Charlie’s Angels is ‘so terrible’ -       Four stars for Bombshell -       Two stars for the Frozen sequel Greta Gerwig’s wonderous adaptation cuts through the novel’s moralistic surface to mine the themes beneath: feminism, creativity, independence and individuality. Without sacrificing any of the story’s period charm or authenticity, she adds a contemporary feel that can appeal to the book’s devoted fans and its sceptics alike. The performances are dynamic, notably those by Saoirse Ronan as the fiery Jo, Florence Pugh as the underestimated Amy, and Laura Dern as their wise mother, Marmee. And the film looks glorious. Wryly knowing and deeply emotional, it is a triumph. Gerwig’s self-assured screenplay restructures the novel by starting with Jo and her sisters as adults, then going back and forth from their childhood to the present. That change highlights them as women, not little women-in-training, each with a sharply-defined character. This Jo is an amalgam of Alcott and her fictional character, first seen as an aspiring writer in New York. She takes her stories to a stern but encouraging publisher, Mr Dashwood, played by Tracy Letts with mutton chops. (He was, of course, Ronan’s father in Gerwig’s first feature, Lady Bird.) “Morals don’t sell nowadays,” he advises Jo, urging her to write more sensationally. Modern though it sounds, that line comes directly from the novel. It also slyly comments on Gerwig’s refusal to moralise, and sets the meta tone for all the Dashwood scenes, which borrow from Alcott’s experience. Fashionable Amy is in Paris as companion to their rich Aunt March, deliciously played by Meryl Streep with eye-rolling hauteur. Back in New England, Meg (Emma Watson) is married and a mother. Quiet, sickly Beth (Eliza Scanlen) is at home playing the piano. The sisters’ memories gracefully take us back seven years, with Meg and Jo on the cusp of adulthood, but still staging theatrics and playing games in the attic. Inside the cosy house, Gerwig and the cinematographer Yorick Le Saux create a world of candlelight and fireside warmth. Outside, the New England countryside is an enticing landscape of clear, bright light and vivid colours, from green lawns to russet leaves and snowy paths.   Ronan is luminous as Jo, volatile and full of lightning-fast reactions. As a rambunctious girl she becomes great friends with Laurie (Timothée Chalamet), the boy next door. And she has an angry streak, prompting Ronan and Dern to have a striking conversation about controlling their tempers. “I'm angry nearly every day of my life,” says the deceptively calm Marmee, who as portrayed by Dern is vivacious and energetic. This Marmee is not mawkish, even when imploring “my girls,” as she calls them, to give away their Christmas breakfast to a poor family suffering nearby. Each of the main characters gets at least one generous set piece in the film, and Jo has several. One of the best silently shows the adult Jo, tired and intense, kneeling over dozens of manuscript pages spread out on the attic floor. It may be set in the 19th Century but the scene is one of the truest depictions of a writer at work ever put on screen. Ronan creates a character that goes deeper than Jo’s profession, though. She is at times torn between her desire for independence and the loneliness of that situation. Pugh and Gerwig redefine the much-maligned Amy, bringing out her passion to be an artist and making her sympathetic. Justice for Amy, at last! Pugh takes her from a petulant child to a thoughtful, sophisticated woman who struggles with the knowledge that she has talent but no genius. Much of the film’s modern, feminist current comes from attitude and style, including Jo’s male-inspired costumes of waistcoats and neck scarves. Occasionally, that theme becomes overt. In Paris, where Laurie has fallen for Amy after Jo has rejected his marriage proposal, he warns her against a loveless marriage for money. “Don’t sit there and tell me that marriage isn’t an economic proposition,” Amy insists, when a woman cannot earn a decent living. And Gerwig gives her a scene Alcott’s readers may have  dreamed of, a perfect example of how the screenplay takes unspoken cues from the novel and lets them blossom. Amy’s first response to Laurie’s declaration of love for her is full of hurt, as Pugh ferociously says: “I have been second to Jo my whole life, and I will not be the person you settle for just because you cannot have her.” Meg is more sanguine but has her own complications. The young woman who dreams of having pretty things when she goes to a ball – frankly, there could be fewer dances in this film – becomes the wife of an impoverished tutor (James Norton). She loves him but blurts out during an argument: “I try to be contented but it is hard. I am tired of being poor.”  There’s not much Scanlen can do with pallid Beth, the soon-to-be-dead sister, though. And Chalamet is more charming as the spirited boy than as the tame adult, who registers so little on screen he might as well be a ghost.   Jo returns to see Dashwood at the end of the film, having written what we now know as Little Women. His advice that she should have the fictional Jo get married, taken from Alcott’s publishing experience, allows Gerwig to create a resolution that is at once swoonily romantic and aware of its over-the-top romanticism. Screen adaptations of Little Women go all the way back to a lost, silent version from 1917, and include the famous 1933 version starring Katharine Hepburn and a lovely 1994 film with Winona Ryder. Even in that long line, Gerwig’s smart, delightful film seems on its way to becoming a classic. ★★★★★ Love film?

Hawkish,‘Diary of a wimpy king’,2024-09-25,2019-11-01,Nicholas Barber,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20190903-venice-film-festival-review-the-king,"David Michôd’s gloomy historical drama The King stars Timothée Chalamet as a brooding and sensitive King Henry V with Robert Pattinson as the evil Dauphin. Nicholas Barber takes a look. The King Director: David Michôd Cast: Robert Pattinson, Timothée Chalamet, Lily-Rose Depp and Joel Edgerton Run-time: 140 min Release date: On Netflix 1 November 2019 This story was originally published on 3 September 2019, when The King premiered at the Venice Film Festival. Timothée Chalamet’s Oscar-nominated turn in Call Me by Your Name made him the poster boy for masculinity at its most delicate and sensitive: his cry-athon over the closing credits made sure of that. But he is even more delicate and sensitive as King Henry V in David Michôd’s sombre historical drama, The King. Never mind that the Prince Hal in Shakespeare’s plays started off a hard-drinking party animal. In The King, he is updated to become Emo Hal. More like this: -        Is Wasp Network this year’s best spy thriller? -        Four stars for The Truth -        Brad Pitt stars in Ad Astra In the opening scenes, he seems unsuitable for kingship, not because he is too much of a wastrel; he is, in fact, a brave and skilful soldier, as he proves in a savage duel with Henry “Hotspur” Percy (Tom Glynn-Carney); who knew that knights in armour spent so much time punching each other? No, the reason Hal doesn’t seem right for England’s top job is that he is just too darn soulful. Whether he is moping around Eastcheap’s taverns as a prince, or arguing with his courtiers when he is on the throne, he always comes across as if he would rather be writing poetry about how unfair the world is. At one point, he pushes an eager wench out of his bed because he wants to lie there and think brooding thoughts instead. He is also absurdly spindly for such an accomplished warrior. Even with his armour on, he is so skinny and awkward that he could be a prototype for C-3PO. Other characters have been modernised, too. Sir John Falstaff, who is likeably played by the film’s co-writer, Joel Edgerton, is no longer Shakespeare’s cowardly sot, but a distinguished, down-to-earth military veteran who is less interested in wine, women and song than in telling people that war is hell. He is more Little John than Friar Tuck, in other words. (And guess who comes up with England’s winning strategy at the battle of Agincourt?) Lily-Rose Depp appears as France’s Princess Catherine, and spends most of her screen time lecturing Henry on male immaturity. In general, The King isn’t a stirring paean to patriotism and martial glory, but a melancholy 21st-Century take on the loneliness of command and the drudgery of war. You might describe it as ‘talky’, but everyone is so soft-spoken that ‘whispery’ would be more accurate. The lighting is low, the palette ranges from greys to browns, and the gloomy orchestral score adds an almost subliminal extra layer of sorrow to what is already a less than exhilarating experience. The story begins with Ben Mendelsohn’s Henry IV looking even more poorly than Ben Mendelsohn usually does. Riddled both with paranoia and some sort of icky medieval pox, he decrees that his successor will be Hal’s squeaky-voiced but hawkish younger brother Thomas (Dean-Charles Chapman). But it is the reluctant Hal who ends up trimming his wavy bob into a Blackadder bowl-cut, and taking over his father’s position in the violent family business: the plot borrows as much from The Godfather as it does from Shakespeare. Once he is in power, Henry’s plan is that the country’s noblemen should forget their grievances and concentrate on, I don’t know, painting their bedrooms black. But when his beady-eyed right-hand man (Sean Harris) captures a French assassin, Henry realises – rather too quickly – that sometimes a king’s got to do what a king’s got to do. A couple of gory executions later, the English fleet sails across the Channel, and Henry makes his own journey from wilting wallflower to ruthless slaughterer. The film’s liveliest scenes come when the army reaches France, and Robert Pattinson camps it up as the ludicrously evil Dauphin. There is a nicely muddy battle sequence after that, and a crafty final twist improves everything that went before it in retrospect. Otherwise, though, The King is an underwhelming character study which makes some obvious points about the steel and ambition required to lead a country. Slightly too fond of its dour mood and its fey leading man, this diary of a wimpy king is recommended principally to people who want to watch Chalamet lounging around being sad, often while he’s got off his top off. Luckily for the film’s producers, that should be quite a lot of people. ★★★☆☆ Love film? Join BBC Culture Film Club on Facebook, a community for film fanatics all over the world.

Hawkish,Our favourite thing?,2024-09-25,2015-03-02,Nicholas Barber,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20150302-our-favourite-thing,"The musical story of the von Trapp family continues to delight audiences 50 years on. But what makes The Sound of Music endure? Nicholas Barber finds out. Never mind Neil Patrick Harris’s underpants or Patricia Arquette’s politics; the show-stopping moment at this year’s Academy Awards came when Lady Gaga sang a medley to celebrate the 50th anniversary of The Sound of Music. Who would have predicted it? There on the stage was the avant-garde electropop star who once wore a dress made of raw meat swishing around in a white ball gown, belting out My Favourite Things in a cut-glass English accent. It was a testament to Gaga’s ability to reinvent herself. But The Sound of Music is just as adept at moving with the times. The events that inspired the film took place in Austria in the 1920s and 1930s. Maria von Trapp’s memoir of those events was published in 1949, and was turned into a stage musical by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II 10 years later. Then came the film. It premiered in 1965, just a few months before The Beatles’ second film, Help! But although we think of The Beatles as dominating the Swinging ‘60s, it was The Sound of Music that was the Oscar-winning smash – and its soundtrack album was the UK’s best-selling LP, not just in 1965, but in 1966 and 1968. The film’s march through the decades doesn’t stop there. In the 1970s and beyond, it was a holiday television staple. In the 1990s, it became the focus of Rocky Horror-style fancy-dress singalong nights. In critics’ polls, Singin’ in The Rain may be held up as the finest of all Hollywood musicals. But the most popular is indisputably The Sound of Music. In an effort to understand the film’s eternal appeal, I thought I should rewatch it on DVD. But then a question struck me: had I ever actually watched it in the first place? I knew I’d seen excerpts from it on clip shows over the years, and I had hazy memories of catching some of it on television on a rainy Sunday afternoon, but I wasn’t sure that I’d ever watched it from start to finish. And I suspect I’m not the only person in that position. We’ve all seen so many snippets and parodies that The Sound of Music is a part of our lives whether we’ve watched it or not. We can hum along to the title song, not to mention Do-Re-Mi and Climb Ev’ry Mountain. We can picture its heroine radiating wholesomeness as she gambols through the Alps, arms outstretched, apron swirling. Most of us can have a stab at summarising the plot, too. A hearty trainee nun called Maria (Julie Andrews) is hired to look after the seven von Trapp children in a Salzburg schloss. She goes on to thaw the heart of the children’s widowed father (Christopher Plummer). But what else happens? Apart from the few scenes and the many songs that are burnt into our brains, what exactly does The Sound of Music entail? The short answer is: not a lot. What surprised me when I finally watched the film last month was that if you’ve seen bits and pieces of it, then you’ve pretty much seen the whole thing. True, the von Trapps have to flee from the Nazis in the last half-hour – a sequence which is almost entirely separate from everything beforehand – but otherwise, there’s not much that happens. Going for a song It’s certainly not a film to watch for its narrative twists and turns. How does Maria win over the hostile von Trapp children? With one rendition of My Favourite Things. What convinces Captain von Trapp that she is a positive influence on his offspring? A performance of The Lonely Goatherd. And what convinces the audience that the captain has been influenced by Maria? A recital of Edelweiss. Compared to the elaborate musicals that made Andrews a star of stage (My Fair Lady) and screen (Mary Poppins), The Sound of Music is more of a concert than a film – a series of catchy Rodgers and Hammerstein numbers linked by some crisp repartee. But that isn’t a criticism. The fact that The Sound of Music resembles a greatest hits album could be the key to its record-breaking success. “In many ways, The Sound of Music follows the classic musical structure that highlights its musical numbers over plot,” says Professor Caryl Flinn of the University Of Michigan, author of a new British Film Institute guide to The Sound of Music. “Cinema scholars in fact have grouped musicals along with porno and horror films for that reason – storylines aren’t generally what draw people in to watch these genres. In porno and horror, it’s all about getting to the next sex scene and the next scare; and in musicals, it’s all about getting to the next song. With The Sound of Music, songs are the real anchor for audiences’ feelings.” It’s the film’s concentration on its peerless songs which accounts for the Sing-a-long Sound of Music phenomenon. In 1999, London’s Prince Charles Cinema started screening it every Friday evening, and encouraged audiences to dress up as the characters. The format has since been exported to cinemas all around the globe. The song-based structure also helps to explain why the film is a television fixture. From a TV station’s point of view, the songs make The Sound of Music easy to chop up into advertising-friendly chunks. From the viewer’s perspective, you can switch it on halfway through, and you won’t have any difficulty picking up the story. ‘Restraint and reserve’ And it isn’t just the plot that has been stripped back to basics. The film’s director and screenwriter, Robert Wise and Ernest Lehman, made West Side Story in 1961, but while that musical bursts with heightened colours and balletic dance routines, The Sound of Music has almost no choreography beyond some decorous waltzing, and no visual flair beyond the scenic shots of sunny Salzburg. “There is so much restraint and reserve in The Sound of Music,” says Professor Flinn. “I think it reflects the production team’s desire to go for simplicity and sincerity, and not risk courting anything too over-the-top or kitschy.” Given that Plummer has spent decades decrying the film’s sickly sweetness, it might seem strange to hear it described in terms of simplicity and restraint, but Professor Flinn could be on to something. The Sound of Music may feature a goat-based puppet show and a gaggle of children in matching clothes made out of curtains, but Wise and Lehman actually diluted the stage play’s syrupy sentimentality: they skip from song to song without dwelling on any of the von Trapps’ triumphs or tragedies. None of the children gets the chance to be too annoying; none of the romance is allowed to become too cloying. Andrews yomps through proceedings with no-nonsense briskness; Plummer stands back and observes them with a wry twinkle in his eye. Even the ending is restrained by today’s standards. We see the von Trapps hiking over the mountains and away from the Nazis, but there are no captions detailing what happened to them next, and no photographs of the real family. You can bet that if The Sound of Music had been made in 2015, it would have had both. Plummer himself has come to acknowledge that the film is less mawkish than it might have been. As he says in an interview in the current issue of Vanity Fair, the director “did keep it from falling over the edge into a sea of treacle”. He’s right. The Sound of Music may be on the very edge of that treacly ocean, but it never quite falls in, and it’s this miraculous balancing act that keeps us watching, even after 50 years. Just ask Lady Gaga.

Hawkish,How The West Wing foreshadowed Obama,2024-09-25,2020-10-26,Jennifer Keishin Armstrong,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20201023-how-the-west-wing-foreshadowed-the-obama-era,"As the stars of the critically acclaimed TV series reunite to urge Americans to vote, Jennifer Keishin Armstrong looks back at the legacy of the show’s earnest optimism In a scene from The West Wing, White House press secretary CJ Cregg and deputy chief of staff Josh Lyman are arguing about the significance of a presidential primary vote taking place later that evening in Hartsfield’s Landing, New Hampshire. In the small town, we’ve learned, all 42 residents vote in person at midnight, and their results, announced soon after, have always reliably predicted the statewide winner of the nation’s crucial first primary. “It’s absurd that 42 people have this kind of power,” Josh says. “I think it’s nice,” CJ counters. “Do you?” “I think it’s democracy at its purest. They all gather at once…”. “At a gas station.” They banter a bit more before CJ delivers the killer line: “Maybe, just maybe, just maybe, those 42 people are teaching us something about ourselves, that freedom is the glory of God, that democracy is its birthright, and that our vote matters.” Josh tries to undercut the seriousness of the moment by bringing up dinner: “You getting that pizza?” It’s easy to assume, from a cynical 2020 perspective, that CJ is being sarcastically melodramatic. But, in fact, she means every word. The West Wing, as a television show, truly, madly, earnestly believes in the power of democracy and the idea of the ‘more perfect union’ that is – that could be – the US. More like this: - A ‘howl of rage’ at Reagan’s America - The film that showed a US in chaos - The ultimate song of hope over despair This scene originally aired in 2002, in the middle of the third season of the acclaimed NBC hit. It was also part of a recent West Wing reunion special in which the original cast gathered to reenact this entire episode, Hartsfield’s Landing, on a Los Angeles stage, with the stated mission of encouraging viewers to vote in the upcoming US presidential election. The special only served to underscore how far US politics have fallen into partisan disarray over the last 18 years, from dewy-eyed speeches on network television shows about the sacredness of voting (and the genuine feeling that this reflected the times) to a real-life president who has fomented doubt in the election process itself and has said he may not accept the results of the November 2020 vote, presumably only if they don’t go his way. The West Wing shows us an America so high on the relatively carefree 1990s that it’s sure things can only get better in the 2000s. That goes especially for the country’s oft-romanticised system of government (and its idiosyncratic election process) so revered that it has long been a blind spot, unquestioned in the name of patriotism. Since The West Wing began in 1999, two of the last three presidents have won the office, while losing the popular vote – thanks to the electoral college system. This is not a reality The West Wing’s soaring instrumentals and inspirationally-lit speeches grappled with. The real-life West Wing of the US White House and the president’s Oval Office have had their share of sentimental depictions in TV and film over the years. In line with the times, two of The West Wing’s 1990s predecessors offered particularly rosy views of the country’s highest office: the sweet 1993 comedy film Dave and the soaring 1995 romance The American President. But the TV series, which ran from 1999 to 2006, elevated the form to an art thanks to the wonky, wordy scripts of Aaron Sorkin, who invested his characters with the unshakable belief that they were doing the most important job on Earth, whatever that may have been, and wrote them beautifully crafted speeches to attest to such. This skill-set matched particularly well with the idea of an insider show about the day-to-day of the US government’s executive branch in the 2000s. And Sorkin corralled a cast who rose to the occasion, with Martin Sheen as the wise (and just-flawed-enough) President Josiah ‘Jed’ Bartlet, John Spencer as the straight-talking chief of staff Leo McGarry, Richard Schiff as the awkward communications director Toby Ziegler, Rob Lowe as the ambitious deputy communications director Sam Seaborn, Stockard Channing as the take-charge First Lady Abbey Bartlet, and the incomparable Bradley Whitford as Josh and Allison Janney as CJ. The administration was studiously centrist: It fought the Christian Right and pushed for modest gun control, but was hawkish on foreign policy at times. CJ argued for hate-crime legislation, but ran into opposition from other staffers. The administration was notoriously wishy-washy on abortion. A striking episode has the president refusing to stay an execution but then atoning for it with his Catholic priest. The West Wing premiered in a pre-9/11 world and chose, probably wisely, not to incorporate anything quite like those terrorist attacks on US soil into its fictional universe. As such, it indulged in an innocence that became unmoored from anything like reality even during its run – and when viewed in 2020, plays like a utopian sci-fi. The West Wing thought, coming on the heels of a Bill Clinton presidency, that liberals were so darn close to getting things right, asking: ‘What if we could have a smart, optimistic, progressive administration… without the icky sex scandals? What if most politicos, deep down, meant well?’ But the recent HBO Max special, released in the lead-up to Donald Trump’s run for re-election against Obama’s vice president, Joe Biden – and came on the same day the two held duelling town halls on separate TV networks, unable to reach agreement on even a debate format – was jarring, to say the least. The funny thing is that, at first, The West Wing seemed downright prescient, particularly to US liberals, when in 2008, just two years after the show signed off, Barack Obama was elected the nation’s first black president. The series had ended with the inauguration of Bartlet’s successor, Matt Santos – a young, Mexican-American, Democratic superstar played by Jimmy Smits and modeled on Obama. When Obama took office, he seemed to be continuing The West Wing’s gilded storyline, fitting right in with its characters. He appeared, to many, like a basically good, if flawed, guy doing his best at one of the hardest jobs in the world. Like President Bartlet, he had an enviable family and egalitarian marriage. Like President Bartlet, he was an intellectual with an easy charisma and a sharp sense of humour. Like President Bartlet, he held liberal ideals but compromised when necessary. Many Obama staffers said they were directly inspired by The West Wing to pursue careers in politics. Beautifully worded optimism It’s no surprise, then, that West Wing cast members have campaigned for Democratic candidates since, speaking out on behalf of Hillary Clinton in her 2016 run against Trump and hosting a Zoom fundraiser for Biden this year, in addition to performing in what was billed as a nonpartisan get-out-the-vote effort (for former First Lady Michelle Obama’s organisation, When We All Vote) on HBO Max. The West Wing was a centrist-Democrat dream that aligned quite well with the Obama-Clinton-Biden team’s loftiest – and, it turned out, unrealistic ideals. “Make this election about smart, and not,” Toby says to the president in the Hartsfield’s Landing episode. “Make it about engaged, and not. Qualified, and not. Make it about a heavyweight. You’re a heavyweight.” One can imagine him saying those exact words to Hillary Clinton in 2016. They would have been equally rousing - but also dead wrong as far as advice goes. The West Wing convinced us that politicians were inherently noble – and that voters were, too. But it’s become harder to believe that in the 14 years the series has been off the air. The West Wing special acknowledged as much, while still retaining the show’s grand - and beautifully worded - optimism. Celebrities appeared in interstitial messages urging viewers to vote, and – perhaps more importantly, at least in West Wing terms – to hope. “Our politics today are a far cry from the romantic vision of The West Wing,” Samuel L Jackson said in his message. “But it’s also a far cry from the vision that’s in our heads and in our hearts. And to change that, you have to vote.” He concluded by questioning whether our assumed cynicism, in comparing The West Wing unfavourably with reality, was warranted: “An unattainable TV fantasy? Why? Vote.” Since The West Wing ended its broadcast run, US television’s depictions of the presidency have become much darker and more cynical: Scandal’s cheating Fitzgerald Grant, House of Cards’ scheming Frank Underwood, Veep’s incompetent and vulgar Selina Meyer. The West Wing feels like a relic of a whole other America – one that seems farther from reality than ever. Lin-Manuel Miranda appeared during another break in The West Wing special to warn us against premature and false news surrounding the November election. His presence was particularly resonant, tying the series to perhaps its greatest artistic successor: Miranda has cited The West Wing as a major influence on his Obama-era masterpiece, Hamilton. His conclusion on the special was, of course, optimistic about how his country will fare in the most contentious election in modern memory: “We’re America,” he said confidently. “We’re good at this.” Jed Bartlet couldn’t have said it better.

Hawkish,Why we've got The Godfather wrong,2024-09-25,2022-03-14,Nicholas Barber,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20220311-the-godfather-have-we-misunderstood-americas-greatest-film,"Fifty years after its premiere, Francis Ford Coppola's classic gangster movie is still considered one of the greatest artworks made about the US, but have we overlooked a key element, asks Nicholas Barber. Fancy watching The Godfather? It's an offer that most of us can't refuse. Adapted from Mario Puzo's bestselling novel, Francis Ford Coppola's gangster saga came second in BBC Culture's 2015 critics poll to find the 100 greatest American films, and there aren't many such lists that don't have it in the top 10. Fifty years on from its release in March 1972, it stands as the defining US artwork not just on organised crime, but on immigration, capitalism and corruption. Even people who aren't familiar with the film can recognise Marlon Brando's weary, wheezy Mafia boss, Vito Corleone, and his favourite son Michael, played by Al Pacino. They can also quote or misquote its most memorable lines – including the one at the top of this paragraph. And its aficionados know it off by heart. In You've Got Mail, Tom Hanks cites it as the source of all wisdom. (""What is it about The Godfather?"" sighs Meg Ryan.) The characters in The Sopranos are such enthusiasts that they name their strip club Bada Bing! after another of its lines.   More like this: -        The monster who terrifies, 100 years on -        The 1971 western that celebrated male intimacy -        The ancient roots of Catwoman Still, the fact that The Godfather should be so easily associated with a strip club raises the contentious issue of its female characters. The running time is three hours, and yet, to quote the Chicago Sun-Times' critic, Roger Ebert: ""There is little room for women in The Godfather."" Some critics have gone further. Molly Haskell wrote in the New York Times in 1997 that ""Coppola's film demeans and demotes women outrageously"". They have a point. There are no women in The Godfather as ferocious as Michelle Pfeiffer's Elvira Hancock in Scarface (1983), or Kathleen Turner and Anjelica Huston's characters in Prizzi's Honor (1985). While Vito, Michael and his brothers get to make deals and plan murders, pour drinks and eat Chinese takeaways, the women in their lives are left to hold the baby. The film is, among other things, a movie about hanging with your bros. Or, as David Thomson put it in Esquire magazine in 2021: ""It is a movie about happiness and feeling good. And guys get it. Always have."" Providing ""the most exultant glimpse of male nature in American film"", The Godfather, Thomson writes, revolves around ""work, order, and the making of decisions"". But it would be unfair to say that the film itself ignores women, even if the men in it so often do. In fact, Coppola keeps reminding us where the female characters are and how they are feeling. The opening speech is about a girl who has been abused, the closing scene has two women questioning and protesting against Michael's methods. The most disturbingly violent sequence has Vito's pregnant daughter Connie (Talia Shire) being whipped by her husband. And when Hollywood mogul Jack Woltz (John Marley) holds forth about a ""young"", ""innocent"" starlet, who ""was the greatest piece of ass I've ever had"", Coppola positions a maid in the background, forced to stand and listen to his misogynistic rant. As for the male Corleones' neglect of their wives and sisters, well, let's not forget that The Godfather is set in the 1940s and 1950s. As much as we may enjoy the performances of Shelley Winters in Roger Corman's Bloody Mama (1970) and Madonna in Warren Beatty's Dick Tracy (1990), Coppola rejects the idea that mid-century Mafia women were pistol-packing molls, scheming femme fatales, or matriarchs doted on by a crowd of momma's boys. Instead, he insists, they were more likely to be pushed aside by their sexist men, who were steeped in blood and betrayal. The Godfather isn't a monument to male chauvinism, but a condemnation of it. And it's all too relevant, half a century after its release. When Vito attends an all-male meeting of Mafia bosses, the boardroom table is identical to those in countless photos of cabinet meetings and corporate conferences today. Cutting off female influence Besides, even though the men drive the plot in The Godfather, the women are vitally important to it. The bravura opening sequence is set at Connie's wedding banquet in the Corleones' family compound. Vito spends most of it in his shadowy study, fielding entreaties from his supplicants (an old Sicilian wedding tradition, apparently), and the dialogue keeps returning to the subject of masculinity. When Vito's top enforcer, Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana), thanks the boss for his wedding invitation, he offers the bride and groom this faltering blessing: ""And I hope that their first child be a masculine child."" Michael has a different perspective – at first, anyway. A decorated World War Two veteran, he brings his girlfriend Kay (Diane Keaton) to the wedding, shares the Corleones' darkest secrets with her, and insists on her being included in a family photograph. But the trajectory charted by the film is his arc away from Kay and towards damnation. ""[Women] will be saints in heaven while we men burn in hell,"" says Vito in Puzo's novel, and Coppola seems to agree. The first time we see Michael and Kay after the wedding, they are on a snowy Christmas shopping spree which could be a scene from a romantic comedy, but when Vito is wounded in a shooting, the real casualty is the couple's closeness. Michael can no longer tell her he loves her while his associates are listening, and he leaves the hotel room where they're having dinner to tend to his father. ""I'm with you now,"" he whispers in Vito's ear.  There is a glimmering chance of redemption when Michael hides out in Sicily and falls for a peasant girl, Apollonia (Simonetta Stefanelli), who dares to challenge him. When he first lays eyes on her, she turns and strides away, and after they are married, she is confident enough to mock him and chide him. Coppola puts her behind the wheel of her husband’s car – literally in the driving seat. Could Michael settle down with a companion who is his trusted equal? Of course not. Apollonia is killed, and Michael returns to the US and the family business – no longer a smiling, tender war hero, but a reptilian tyrant who orders multiple murders, lies about them to his nearest and dearest, and professes to reject Satan at a baptism while his enemies are gunned down. By this stage, ""I hope that their first child be a masculine child,"" sounds more like a curse than a blessing. Michael also reunites with Kay, but his marriage proposal is no longer the stuff of romantic comedies. While Apollonia was in the driving seat, the tearful Kay is ushered into the back of a chauffeur-driven car. You could easily mistake the scene for a kidnapping. In Puzo's novel, Kay is willing to accept her place in the Corleone crime syndicate, but the film's famous ending has Michael's study door being closed in her distraught face so that he can strategise with his lieutenants in private. She is separated from him, just as Vito's wife (Morgana King) was all through the film. That's what being a Mafia boss means, it seems: being cut off from female influence. None of this proves that the film is feminist, exactly: Coppola is too reverential towards its martyred women for that. In a Sight and Sound interview from 1972, reprinted in the current issue, he waxes lyrical about ""a kind of feminine, magical quality, dating back to the Virgin Mary or something I picked up in catechism classes, that fascinates me"". And it's true that he never paints the female Corleones in shades of grey. Kay, Apollonia and Vito's wife never condone their husbands' crimes, and Connie is banished to an apartment in New York after her wedding. It's as if Coppola can't bear the thought that they might be complicit in the men's nefarious deeds. But his approach in The Godfather doesn't ""demean or demote"" women so much as it places them on a pedestal. You wouldn’t want many gangster films to have such angelic female characters. We are lucky to have had Lorraine Bracco as Karen Hill in Goodfellas (1990) and Sharon Stone as Ginger McKenna in Casino (1995), for example, as well as a new wave of female-led mob movies. In 2019's The Kitchen, Melissa McCarthy, Tiffany Haddish and Elisabeth Moss took over their husbands' rackets in late-1970s New York. Jennifer Lopez is due to play Griselda Blanco, a Colombian drug dealer, in The Godmother. And Jennifer Lawrence has signed on to star in Mob Girl as Arlyne Brickman, a gangster turned government witness. These films may be a necessary corrective to The Godfather, but Coppola put more thought than most male writer-directors into what happens when women are excluded from men's lives. After The Godfather Part II – in which Kay abandons Michael – his next film was his 1979 Vietnam War masterpiece, Apocalypse Now (also featuring Marlon Brando). Again, there are almost no women in it, and, again, the women who are in it are archetypes rather than nuanced characters. But, again, they are clearly on Coppola's mind, in scenes ranging from the Playboy bunnies' calamitous show for the troops, to the killing of ""Mr Clean"" (Laurence Fishburne) while he is listening to a recording of his mother's voice.  As in The Godfather, the hollow left by absent women has been filled with blood. In the extended ""Redux"" edit of Apocalypse Now, which Coppola completed in 2001, Martin Sheen's Willard spends a night with a widow (Aurore Clémont) on a French plantation, who tells him: ""There are two of you, don't you see? One that kills and one that loves."" Just like Michael Corleone in Sicily, he glimpses how life could be if he was one that loves rather than one that kills. But the next morning he returns to his mission on the Stygian river, on a journey away from humanity and into the heart of darkness.   Love film and TV?

Hawkish,‘Diary of a wimpy king’,2024-09-25,2019-11-01,Nicholas Barber,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20190903-venice-film-festival-review-the-king,"David Michôd’s gloomy historical drama The King stars Timothée Chalamet as a brooding and sensitive King Henry V with Robert Pattinson as the evil Dauphin. Nicholas Barber takes a look. The King Director: David Michôd Cast: Robert Pattinson, Timothée Chalamet, Lily-Rose Depp and Joel Edgerton Run-time: 140 min Release date: On Netflix 1 November 2019 This story was originally published on 3 September 2019, when The King premiered at the Venice Film Festival. Timothée Chalamet’s Oscar-nominated turn in Call Me by Your Name made him the poster boy for masculinity at its most delicate and sensitive: his cry-athon over the closing credits made sure of that. But he is even more delicate and sensitive as King Henry V in David Michôd’s sombre historical drama, The King. Never mind that the Prince Hal in Shakespeare’s plays started off a hard-drinking party animal. In The King, he is updated to become Emo Hal. More like this: -        Is Wasp Network this year’s best spy thriller? -        Four stars for The Truth -        Brad Pitt stars in Ad Astra In the opening scenes, he seems unsuitable for kingship, not because he is too much of a wastrel; he is, in fact, a brave and skilful soldier, as he proves in a savage duel with Henry “Hotspur” Percy (Tom Glynn-Carney); who knew that knights in armour spent so much time punching each other? No, the reason Hal doesn’t seem right for England’s top job is that he is just too darn soulful. Whether he is moping around Eastcheap’s taverns as a prince, or arguing with his courtiers when he is on the throne, he always comes across as if he would rather be writing poetry about how unfair the world is. At one point, he pushes an eager wench out of his bed because he wants to lie there and think brooding thoughts instead. He is also absurdly spindly for such an accomplished warrior. Even with his armour on, he is so skinny and awkward that he could be a prototype for C-3PO. Other characters have been modernised, too. Sir John Falstaff, who is likeably played by the film’s co-writer, Joel Edgerton, is no longer Shakespeare’s cowardly sot, but a distinguished, down-to-earth military veteran who is less interested in wine, women and song than in telling people that war is hell. He is more Little John than Friar Tuck, in other words. (And guess who comes up with England’s winning strategy at the battle of Agincourt?) Lily-Rose Depp appears as France’s Princess Catherine, and spends most of her screen time lecturing Henry on male immaturity. In general, The King isn’t a stirring paean to patriotism and martial glory, but a melancholy 21st-Century take on the loneliness of command and the drudgery of war. You might describe it as ‘talky’, but everyone is so soft-spoken that ‘whispery’ would be more accurate. The lighting is low, the palette ranges from greys to browns, and the gloomy orchestral score adds an almost subliminal extra layer of sorrow to what is already a less than exhilarating experience. The story begins with Ben Mendelsohn’s Henry IV looking even more poorly than Ben Mendelsohn usually does. Riddled both with paranoia and some sort of icky medieval pox, he decrees that his successor will be Hal’s squeaky-voiced but hawkish younger brother Thomas (Dean-Charles Chapman). But it is the reluctant Hal who ends up trimming his wavy bob into a Blackadder bowl-cut, and taking over his father’s position in the violent family business: the plot borrows as much from The Godfather as it does from Shakespeare. Once he is in power, Henry’s plan is that the country’s noblemen should forget their grievances and concentrate on, I don’t know, painting their bedrooms black. But when his beady-eyed right-hand man (Sean Harris) captures a French assassin, Henry realises – rather too quickly – that sometimes a king’s got to do what a king’s got to do. A couple of gory executions later, the English fleet sails across the Channel, and Henry makes his own journey from wilting wallflower to ruthless slaughterer. The film’s liveliest scenes come when the army reaches France, and Robert Pattinson camps it up as the ludicrously evil Dauphin. There is a nicely muddy battle sequence after that, and a crafty final twist improves everything that went before it in retrospect. Otherwise, though, The King is an underwhelming character study which makes some obvious points about the steel and ambition required to lead a country. Slightly too fond of its dour mood and its fey leading man, this diary of a wimpy king is recommended principally to people who want to watch Chalamet lounging around being sad, often while he’s got off his top off. Luckily for the film’s producers, that should be quite a lot of people. ★★★☆☆ Love film? Join BBC Culture Film Club on Facebook, a community for film fanatics all over the world.

Hawkish,How The West Wing foreshadowed Obama,2024-09-25,2020-10-26,Jennifer Keishin Armstrong,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20201023-how-the-west-wing-foreshadowed-the-obama-era,"As the stars of the critically acclaimed TV series reunite to urge Americans to vote, Jennifer Keishin Armstrong looks back at the legacy of the show’s earnest optimism In a scene from The West Wing, White House press secretary CJ Cregg and deputy chief of staff Josh Lyman are arguing about the significance of a presidential primary vote taking place later that evening in Hartsfield’s Landing, New Hampshire. In the small town, we’ve learned, all 42 residents vote in person at midnight, and their results, announced soon after, have always reliably predicted the statewide winner of the nation’s crucial first primary. “It’s absurd that 42 people have this kind of power,” Josh says. “I think it’s nice,” CJ counters. “Do you?” “I think it’s democracy at its purest. They all gather at once…”. “At a gas station.” They banter a bit more before CJ delivers the killer line: “Maybe, just maybe, just maybe, those 42 people are teaching us something about ourselves, that freedom is the glory of God, that democracy is its birthright, and that our vote matters.” Josh tries to undercut the seriousness of the moment by bringing up dinner: “You getting that pizza?” It’s easy to assume, from a cynical 2020 perspective, that CJ is being sarcastically melodramatic. But, in fact, she means every word. The West Wing, as a television show, truly, madly, earnestly believes in the power of democracy and the idea of the ‘more perfect union’ that is – that could be – the US. More like this: - A ‘howl of rage’ at Reagan’s America - The film that showed a US in chaos - The ultimate song of hope over despair This scene originally aired in 2002, in the middle of the third season of the acclaimed NBC hit. It was also part of a recent West Wing reunion special in which the original cast gathered to reenact this entire episode, Hartsfield’s Landing, on a Los Angeles stage, with the stated mission of encouraging viewers to vote in the upcoming US presidential election. The special only served to underscore how far US politics have fallen into partisan disarray over the last 18 years, from dewy-eyed speeches on network television shows about the sacredness of voting (and the genuine feeling that this reflected the times) to a real-life president who has fomented doubt in the election process itself and has said he may not accept the results of the November 2020 vote, presumably only if they don’t go his way. The West Wing shows us an America so high on the relatively carefree 1990s that it’s sure things can only get better in the 2000s. That goes especially for the country’s oft-romanticised system of government (and its idiosyncratic election process) so revered that it has long been a blind spot, unquestioned in the name of patriotism. Since The West Wing began in 1999, two of the last three presidents have won the office, while losing the popular vote – thanks to the electoral college system. This is not a reality The West Wing’s soaring instrumentals and inspirationally-lit speeches grappled with. The real-life West Wing of the US White House and the president’s Oval Office have had their share of sentimental depictions in TV and film over the years. In line with the times, two of The West Wing’s 1990s predecessors offered particularly rosy views of the country’s highest office: the sweet 1993 comedy film Dave and the soaring 1995 romance The American President. But the TV series, which ran from 1999 to 2006, elevated the form to an art thanks to the wonky, wordy scripts of Aaron Sorkin, who invested his characters with the unshakable belief that they were doing the most important job on Earth, whatever that may have been, and wrote them beautifully crafted speeches to attest to such. This skill-set matched particularly well with the idea of an insider show about the day-to-day of the US government’s executive branch in the 2000s. And Sorkin corralled a cast who rose to the occasion, with Martin Sheen as the wise (and just-flawed-enough) President Josiah ‘Jed’ Bartlet, John Spencer as the straight-talking chief of staff Leo McGarry, Richard Schiff as the awkward communications director Toby Ziegler, Rob Lowe as the ambitious deputy communications director Sam Seaborn, Stockard Channing as the take-charge First Lady Abbey Bartlet, and the incomparable Bradley Whitford as Josh and Allison Janney as CJ. The administration was studiously centrist: It fought the Christian Right and pushed for modest gun control, but was hawkish on foreign policy at times. CJ argued for hate-crime legislation, but ran into opposition from other staffers. The administration was notoriously wishy-washy on abortion. A striking episode has the president refusing to stay an execution but then atoning for it with his Catholic priest. The West Wing premiered in a pre-9/11 world and chose, probably wisely, not to incorporate anything quite like those terrorist attacks on US soil into its fictional universe. As such, it indulged in an innocence that became unmoored from anything like reality even during its run – and when viewed in 2020, plays like a utopian sci-fi. The West Wing thought, coming on the heels of a Bill Clinton presidency, that liberals were so darn close to getting things right, asking: ‘What if we could have a smart, optimistic, progressive administration… without the icky sex scandals? What if most politicos, deep down, meant well?’ But the recent HBO Max special, released in the lead-up to Donald Trump’s run for re-election against Obama’s vice president, Joe Biden – and came on the same day the two held duelling town halls on separate TV networks, unable to reach agreement on even a debate format – was jarring, to say the least. The funny thing is that, at first, The West Wing seemed downright prescient, particularly to US liberals, when in 2008, just two years after the show signed off, Barack Obama was elected the nation’s first black president. The series had ended with the inauguration of Bartlet’s successor, Matt Santos – a young, Mexican-American, Democratic superstar played by Jimmy Smits and modeled on Obama. When Obama took office, he seemed to be continuing The West Wing’s gilded storyline, fitting right in with its characters. He appeared, to many, like a basically good, if flawed, guy doing his best at one of the hardest jobs in the world. Like President Bartlet, he had an enviable family and egalitarian marriage. Like President Bartlet, he was an intellectual with an easy charisma and a sharp sense of humour. Like President Bartlet, he held liberal ideals but compromised when necessary. Many Obama staffers said they were directly inspired by The West Wing to pursue careers in politics. Beautifully worded optimism It’s no surprise, then, that West Wing cast members have campaigned for Democratic candidates since, speaking out on behalf of Hillary Clinton in her 2016 run against Trump and hosting a Zoom fundraiser for Biden this year, in addition to performing in what was billed as a nonpartisan get-out-the-vote effort (for former First Lady Michelle Obama’s organisation, When We All Vote) on HBO Max. The West Wing was a centrist-Democrat dream that aligned quite well with the Obama-Clinton-Biden team’s loftiest – and, it turned out, unrealistic ideals. “Make this election about smart, and not,” Toby says to the president in the Hartsfield’s Landing episode. “Make it about engaged, and not. Qualified, and not. Make it about a heavyweight. You’re a heavyweight.” One can imagine him saying those exact words to Hillary Clinton in 2016. They would have been equally rousing - but also dead wrong as far as advice goes. The West Wing convinced us that politicians were inherently noble – and that voters were, too. But it’s become harder to believe that in the 14 years the series has been off the air. The West Wing special acknowledged as much, while still retaining the show’s grand - and beautifully worded - optimism. Celebrities appeared in interstitial messages urging viewers to vote, and – perhaps more importantly, at least in West Wing terms – to hope. “Our politics today are a far cry from the romantic vision of The West Wing,” Samuel L Jackson said in his message. “But it’s also a far cry from the vision that’s in our heads and in our hearts. And to change that, you have to vote.” He concluded by questioning whether our assumed cynicism, in comparing The West Wing unfavourably with reality, was warranted: “An unattainable TV fantasy? Why? Vote.” Since The West Wing ended its broadcast run, US television’s depictions of the presidency have become much darker and more cynical: Scandal’s cheating Fitzgerald Grant, House of Cards’ scheming Frank Underwood, Veep’s incompetent and vulgar Selina Meyer. The West Wing feels like a relic of a whole other America – one that seems farther from reality than ever. Lin-Manuel Miranda appeared during another break in The West Wing special to warn us against premature and false news surrounding the November election. His presence was particularly resonant, tying the series to perhaps its greatest artistic successor: Miranda has cited The West Wing as a major influence on his Obama-era masterpiece, Hamilton. His conclusion on the special was, of course, optimistic about how his country will fare in the most contentious election in modern memory: “We’re America,” he said confidently. “We’re good at this.” Jed Bartlet couldn’t have said it better. Here’s to hoping he’s right.   Love film and TV? Join BBC Culture Film and TV Club on Facebook, a community for cinephiles all over the world.

Hawkish,The Rings of Power is 'staggering',2024-09-25,2022-08-31,Stephen Kelly,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20220830-rings-of-power-review-a-visually-staggering-but-flawed-epic,"The Lord of the Rings prequel is Amazon's most expensive show to date – but can it be the hit the streamer needs? On the basis of two episodes, the jury's out, writes Stephen Kelly. It is a curious quirk of fate that The Rings of Power, a Lord of the Rings prequel based on the histories of a fictional world, written by JRR Tolkien, should premiere two weeks after House of the Dragon, a Game of Thrones prequel based on the histories of a fictional world written by George RR Martin. More like this: –      The ancient roots of Lord of the Rings –      Did Tolkien write 'juvenile trash'? –      House of the Dragon is 'pure Game of Thrones' Martin, of course, famously wrote Game of Thrones as a reaction to The Lord of the Rings, with the aim of turning its heroic tale of good versus evil into something grittier and real (""what was Aragorn's tax policy?"" he once asked). While The Rings of Power, Amazon Prime's biggest, most expensive show to date, seems to have been created as a reaction to Game of Thrones, with seemingly every streamer of recent years desperate to emulate its success. Based on its first two episodes, the result is fantasy television of unparalleled grandeur – one more suited to cinema screens than laptops and TVs – with a world that is vividly realised, and a plot that, while undeniably uneven, is charged with a soaring sense of mythic lyricism. Developed by showrunners JD Payne and Patrick McKay, relative newcomers in the world of screenwriting, The Rings of Power is largely adapted from the immense backstory found in the appendices of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy. It is set in the Second Age of Middle-earth, thousands of years before the adventures of Frodo and the Fellowship, and – as we're told in solemn voiceover by Morfydd Clark's Galadriel – centuries after a great war between Morgoth, a godlike being of supreme evil, and the elves. It tells the sprawling story of how the sorcerer Sauron, a once-devoted servant of Morgoth, first rose to power through the forging of the 19 rings, which he secretly controlled through the One Ring (Gollum's ""precious""). The Rings of Power is the passion project of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, who in recent years has become a contentious symbol of billionaire decadence. The rights alone cost $250 million. In a Vanity Fair article published earlier this year, it was reported that the first season cost $462 million to make (to contrast, the first season of Amazon's other big fantasy series, The Wheel of Time, cost $80 million). In the end, expenditure for marketing and subsequent seasons will likely push the entire project past $1bn, which would make it the costliest show ever made. So far, that money burns right through the screen. For a television series, the production values are staggering. The sets feel huge and lived-in, the costumes are beautiful and intricate, and the digital effects are sharper than most movies. Because of rights issues, The Rings of Power cannot brand itself as a prequel to Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings films, but the family resemblance is uncanny. Just take the scope and scale of its shooting in New Zealand, whose sweeping vistas and idyllic greenery were first favoured by Jackson. This time they are utilised by, among others, JA Bayona, best known for directing the underrated Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, who takes charge of the first two episodes of the eight-episode series made available for review.  Just as it did in the LOTR films, New Zealand's scenery grounds the story in a place that manages to feel both authentic and unearthly. There is also a fluid elegance to how on-location shots and practical sets are blended with digital backdrops, which carry an almost painterly quality to their design. This especially goes for many of the scenes involving the elves, which tend to be bathed in beautiful, ethereal light. Compared to Jackson's trilogy, which had a more textured, characterful look, this shine can give The Rings of Power a chilly quality at times, almost as though it is too clean, too immaculate. It is undeniable, however, that in purely aesthetic terms, this is the closest a TV show has come to blurring the lines between television and cinema – even if, narratively, it is a rather ponderous version of the former so far. As the story begins, Galadriel is the only one who believes that Sauron, who killed her brother, is not only still alive, but is building an army of Orcs in secret. Most viewers will recognise Galadriel from Peter Jackson's trilogy, where she is played as the epitome of Elven wisdom by Cate Blanchett. Here, thousands of years younger, she is a rougher prospect: brasher, angrier, and played with steely conviction by Clark, who anchors the show with an authoritative, commanding performance; little surprise to anyone who saw her blistering turn in 2019 horror Saint Maud.  Galadriel is determined to find Sauron, but is being held back by her fellow elves. A young Elrond (played by Robert Aramayo) thinks that her obsession has gone too far. ""Evil does not sleep, Elrond,"" she tells him. ""It waits until the moment of our complacency, it blinds us."" Elrond himself has a task. He has been ordered by the Elven king to assist the legendary smith – and future creator of the rings – Celebrimbor (Charles Edwards) on a special project, which will take him to the spectacular realm of the dwarves. While across the map – and yes, there is a map – we are introduced to the Southlands, where tensions between elves and men run high, and the Rhovanion, where Nori (Markella Kavenagh), part of the tiny breed of Harfoots who are a kind of Irish variant of the Hobbits, yearns for adventure – right before it falls from the sky. The first episode struggles slightly under the weight of establishing the world and setting up all of its threads; some of which are more interesting than others. The forbidden romance between Elf Arondir (Ismael Cruz Córdova) and human Bronwyn (Nazanin Boniadi) in the Southlands, for example, is quite flat in comparison with Galadriel's compelling mission of revenge. The Harfoots, meanwhile, straddle a thin line between charming and mawkish, although the charm wins out in the end thanks to a scene-stealing performance from Kavenagh, and a joyful appearance from Lenny Henry as a Harfoot elder. (It should also be noted that Henry is one of many black actors in the cast: a welcome update to the unfortunate racial optics of Jackson's trilogy). The second episode is snappier and more engrossing. There's a thrilling (and again, impressively epic) sequence set at sea, while much of the show's early levity comes through a wonderful set of scenes between Elrond and his old dwarven friend Durin (Owain Arthur), who is upset at the Middle-earth equivalent of Elrond having left him on read. This episode also announces The Rings of Power as quite a different prospect to The Hobbit or The Lord of the Rings. Rather than a hero's journey, this is a slower, more granular tale, which can at times suffer from the prequel urge to fill in backstory – much like an appendix. As is often the case with prequels, seeing what already happened in the past is not as interesting as pushing a plot forward (the exceptions, such as Better Call Saul, tend to negate that by going in-depth on character). Unlike, say, Game of Thrones, the characters of The Rings of Power are more archetypal, more traditionally mythic. This is not to say that Game of Thrones is better because it is more subversive: Tolkien and Martin merely inhabit two different realms of fantasy. Game of Thrones is engrossing because of its complicated characters and challenging morals; The Lord of the Rings, while not a simple tale of good and evil (remember Boromir?) is arguably more poetic in tone, and ultimately more moving in nature. The first two episodes of The Rings of Power occupy an awkward space where it's not yet apparent if either of these approaches apply to it – its characters have not yet revealed themselves as complex, while it's too early to tell if it will rebottle the catharsis of Tolkien's work or Peter Jackson's movies. Yet what does make it work so far is what made The Lord of the Rings work: the earnestness of its performances, and the sincerity of its writing. Showrunners JD Payne and Patrick McKay may have come from nowhere to develop The Rings of Power, but they display a deft understanding of Tolkien's soothing rhythms, his grandeur and musicality. It's a pleasure to hear the characters talk. There are reports that The Rings of Power will determine the future of Amazon's streaming strategy. Whether it will be the hit that Amazon Prime needs it to be – considering the amount of money that it costs – remains to be seen. Based on the first two episodes, the signs are promising – but maybe promising is not enough when expectations are this high. Either way, there is no doubting the scale of the show's ambition, or its dedication to the soul and substance of Tolkien's work. For a TV show that is essentially the newest play-toy of a billionaire, it is surprisingly bold stuff. ★★★★☆ The first two episode of Rings of Power premiere on Amazon Prime on 2 September, with subsequent episodes following weekly  Love film and TV?

Hawkish,Why nostalgia is good for you,2024-09-25,2014-06-04,Tom Stafford,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20140603-why-nostalgia-is-good-for-you,"The past is not just a foreign country, but also one we are all exiled from. Like all exiles, we sometimes long to return. That longing is called nostalgia. Whether it is triggered by a photograph, a first kiss or a treasured possession, nostalgia evokes a particular sense of time or place. We all know the feeling: a sweet sadness for what is gone, in colours that are invariably sepia-toned, rose-tinted, or stained with evening sunlight. The term “nostalgia” was coined by Swiss physicians in the late 1600s to signify a certain kind of homesickness among soldiers. Nowadays we know it encompasses more than just homesickness (or indeed Swiss soldiers), and if we take nostalgia too far it becomes mawkish or indulgent. But, perhaps, it has some function beyond mere sentimentality. A series of investigations by psychologist Constantine Sedikides suggest nostalgia may act as a resource that we can draw on to connect to other people and events, so that we can move forward with less fear and greater purpose. Sedikides was inspired by something called Terror Management Theory (TMT), which is approximately 8,000 times sexier than most theories in psychology, and posits that a primary psychological need for humans is to deal with the inevitability of our own deaths. The roots of this theory are in the psychoanalytic tradition of Sigmund Freud, making the theory a bit different from many modern psychological theories, which draw on more mundane inspirations, such as considering the mind as a computer. Experiments published in 2008 used a standard way to test Terror Management Theory: asking participants to think about their own deaths, answering questions such as: ""Briefly describe the emotions that the thought of your own death arouses in you."" (A control group was asked to think about dental pain, something unpleasant, but not existentially threatening.) TMT suggests that one response to thinking about death is to cling more strongly to the view that life has some wider meaning, so after their intervention they asked participants to indicate their agreement with statements such as: ""Life has no meaning or purpose”, or “All strivings in life are futile and absurd”. From the answers they positioned participants on a scale of how strongly they felt life had meaning. The responses were influenced by how prone people were to nostalgia. The researchers found that reminding participants of their own deaths was likely to increase feelings of meaninglessness, but only in those who reported that they were less likely to indulge in nostalgia. Participants who rated themselves as more likely than average to have nostalgic thoughts weren't affected by negative thoughts about their mortality (they rated life as highly meaningful, just like the control group). Follow-up experiments suggest that people prone to nostalgia were less likely to have lingering thoughts about death, as well as less likely to be vulnerable to feelings of loneliness. Nostalgia, according to this view, is very different from a weakness or indulgence. The researchers call it a ""meaning providing resource"", a vital part of mental health. Nostalgia acts a store of positive emotions in memory, something we can access consciously, and perhaps also draw on continuously during our daily lives to bolster our feelings. It’s these strong feelings for our past that helps us cope better with our future. Thanks to Jules Hall for suggesting the topic of nostalgia.

Hawkish,The Oscars that celebrated change,2024-09-25,2018-03-05,Nicholas Barber,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20180305-the-oscelebrated-diversity-as-the-shape-of-water-triumphed,"The 90th Academy Awards celebrated inclusion in a night where Guillermo del Toro’s outsider fantasy The Shape of Water triumphed. Hooray for Hollywood! That’s been the message of the Academy Awards for the past nine decades, but the last year has raised the question of whether there’s really all that much to cheer about. The fall of Harvey Weinstein has triggered reverberations that are still shaking the industry, as more and more of its men are exposed as abusers, predators and, if nothing else, unequal payers. In the circumstances, it seemed likely that the 90th Oscar ceremony would be a muted affair, with apologies instead of accolades. But that’s not how things turned out. Returning for his second stint as host, Jimmy Kimmel was upfront enough to make a crack about Weinstein in his opening monologue, and he joked about why the Oscar statuette was so respected: you can always see his hands are and he doesn’t have a penis. But, as ever, the Academy Awards ceremony didn’t showcase a business which was dwelling on its failings, but one which was celebrating its triumphs. No one was wearing sackcloth and ashes. For that matter, black dresses weren’t mandatory, as they were at the Baftas and the Golden Globes, and Time’s Up badges were missing from plenty of lapels. The set designers clearly weren’t going for humble remorse, either. Beneath a proscenium arch of glittering rocks, the background scenery for much of the night was a distinctly Trumpish collection of gilded pillars and baroque swags, like a Beauty and the Beast-themed suite in a Las Vegas hotel. As for the content of the show, the entertainment between each award didn’t suggest that Hollywood was taking a long hard look at itself. Or rather, it suggested that Hollywood was indeed taking a long hard look at itself - but that it was absolutely loving what it saw. As this was the Oscars’ 90th anniversary, there was montage after nostalgic montage of the Industry’s Greatest Hits. And when the awards themselves were presented, the recurring theme wasn’t that change was needed, but that it was already well underway. Ashley Judd, Annabella Sciorra and Salma Hayek presented a segment in celebration of the MeToo movement’s “trailblazers” - and Judd had viewers googling “intersectionality”. Later, a barnstorming Frances McDormand asked every female nominee in the room to stand up in solidarity - and she had viewers googling “inclusion rider”. And throughout the evening, there were very few speeches or songs which didn’t touch upon diversity and representation, support for immigrants and opposition to the NRA (although the US president was barely mentioned). There was Wes Studi introducing a montage in praise of war films, first in English and then in Cherokee. There was A Fantastic Woman winning the Best Foreign Film prize, and its trans star, Daniela Vega, introducing Sufjan Stevens’ performance of Mystery of Love from Call Me By Your Name. There was a female producer, Darla Anderson, thanking her wife, and a male writer, Adrian Molina, thanking his husband, when they accepted the Best Animated Feature award for Coco, a Disney/Pixar love letter to Mexico. And there was Jordan Peele winning his Oscar for Get Out, making him the first ever African-American to get the Best Original Screenplay prize - and making Get Out the first ever horror movie to get that prize, too. Most entertainingly, there were Tiffany Haddish and Maya Rudolph delivering an uproarious “Oscars So Black” sketch. And, to cap it all, The Shape of Water was the evening’s big winner, having taken the prizes for production design, score, best director and best picture. Other awards were shared by a generous range of films, but it seemed apt that Guillermo del Toro’s Cold-War sci-fi romance, a call for the marginalised to band together against white patriarchy, should be victorious. For all of its genuinely ground-breaking moments, though, the ceremony couldn’t hold the attention for four - yes, four - hours. Partly this was because Kimmel was a safe pair of hands: funny, fast, relaxed, but no longer surprising. (Haddish and Rudolph next year, perhaps?) Partly it was because almost all of the awards went to their excepted recipients: you would have been a fool to bet against Frances McDormand winning best actress (Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri), Gary Oldman winning best actor (Darkest Hour), Allison Janney winning best supporting actress (I, Tonya), Sam Rockwell winning best supporting actor (Three Billboards), the 89-year-old James Ivory winning best adapted screenplay (Call Me Your Name), Coco winning best animated feature, or Roger Deakins winning best cinematography (Blade Runner 2049) on his 14th time of asking. But a more significant factor was the ceremony’s sheer mass of self-congratulation. There are only so many times you can watch someone getting a standing ovation for singing an inspirational anthem before you reach for the remote control and go searching for a monster-truck rally. What with all of the political tub-thumping, and all of the showbiz razzle dazzle, viewers were relentlessly assured of how wholesome Hollywood was, but also how glitzy it was, until you had the queasy sensation you might get from eating a bowlful of muesli with chocolate cupcake frosting on top. Towards the end of the ceremony, it felt as if Hollywood was protesting too much. Its belated willingness to address its gender-related crimes and misdemeanours has been astonishing in its speed and its impact, not just on the film business, but on all walks of life. Nonetheless, considering that it’s less than a year since the Weinstein scandal broke, maybe it’s slightly too soon for the Academy to be so complacently comfortable with itself - so certain that its problems are in the past. Still, you could say that Tinseltown was simply doing what it has always done. It was taking something as depressing as a decades-long history of sexual misconduct, and turning it into a cheesily uplifting narrative with a heartwarming happy ending. That’s Hollywood.

Hawkish,Why India is furious about a set of stamps,2024-09-25,2018-09-29,By M Ilyas Khan,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-45671501,"The foreign ministers of India and Pakistan were supposed to meet this week on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York. The meeting was agreed more than a week ago, raising hopes of movement towards a more cordial relationship between the two nuclear-armed foes, and possibly even fresh peace talks. After all, the neighbours hadn't met at such a senior level since 2014. But within 24 hours, the briefly open door was slammed shut when India called off the meeting. Pakistan's ""evil agenda"" had been exposed and ""the true face"" of new Prime Minister Imran Khan had been ""revealed to the world"", a spokesman said. Why? Well, part of the reason was a set of stamps.   The stamps carry 20 different images of what Pakistan calls ""atrocities in Indian-occupied Kashmir"". They include images of victims of alleged chemical weapons, pellet guns, ""fake police encounters"" and ""braid chopping"", scenes of general abuse and pictures of Kashmiri protests. One stamp carries a picture of Burhan Wani, a popular Kashmiri militant leader killed in 2016, and describes him as a ""freedom icon"". Wani, who was linked to the Hizbul Mujahideen militant group, was killed in a gunfight with Indian forces in 2016. His death sparked widespread protests in the region that still continue. Another stamp shows a Kashmiri protester, Farooq Ahmed Dar, tied to the front bumper of a military jeep purportedly as a ""human shield"" against stone-throwing and gun-firing protesters. A line in Urdu text running down the left side of the stamps reads: ""Kashmir will become Pakistan."" This contrasts with a 1960 commemorative stamp which showed a Pakistani map, with Kashmir shown in a different colour and a more neutral text line saying: ""Jammu & Kashmir; Final Status Not Yet Determined.""  India and Pakistan have fought two wars over the Himalayan Muslim-majority territory, which both claim in full but control in part. India accuses Pakistan of harbouring and supporting cross-border militants who are active in Indian-administered Kashmir - an allegation Pakistan denies.  India cited the issue of stamps as one of two reasons why it called off the meeting at the UN. The other was the killing of an Indian border guard and three Kashmiri policemen by suspected militants. In a statement, a spokesman for India's Ministry of External Affairs said: ""The latest brutal killings of our security personnel by Pakistan-based entities and the recent release of a series of 20 postage stamps by Pakistan glorifying a terrorist and terrorism confirm that Pakistan will not mend its ways."" Pakistan's Foreign Office responded on the same day, saying: ""By falsely raising the canard of terrorism, India can neither hide its unspeakable crimes against the Kashmiri people nor can it delegitimise their indigenous struggle for their inalienable right to self determination."" The meeting was proposed by Pakistan's newly elected Prime Minister Imran Khan and was agreed to by India. The ""normalisation"" process between the two countries, started in 2010, broke down in 2014 due to increased militant attacks in Indian-administered Kashmir. A top official of Pakistan Post, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told the BBC that anyone could propose a commemorative postal stamp.  ""Once it is cleared by Pakistan Post, it needs to be approved by the communications ministry, and also by the foreign ministry if it has a bearing on Pakistan's foreign relations. The final approval is given by the prime minister's office."" But he was reluctant to identify the source of this particular idea. Interestingly, though, as Pakistan Post officials admit, the idea was floated and implemented during the caretaker government, which took charge of day-to-day affairs of the state ahead of the election which Mr Khan's PTI party won. The stamps were issued on 24 July, a day ahead of the general elections, and some 25 days before the new prime minister was sworn in. Observers speculate that the idea must have come from state institutions with a hawkish stand on relations with India.  The two elected governments since 2008 have both pushed for normalisation of ties with India. Both have come under pressure either directly from the military or from political groups suspected of having support from the military intelligence network. The last government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif fell out with the military over its alleged support for militant networks operating in India and Afghanistan, as was revealed by a report in the Dawn newspaper. Sharif was ousted in what was seen by many as an unfair trial, described by some as part of a ""creeping coup against democracy"". The military has also been blamed for ""managing"" the July elections. It denies all these accusations but critics say its huge business and financial interests hinge on painting India as a mortal enemy. They say the stamps were issued at a time when the military dominated the political scene.  Philatelists in Pakistan say the Kashmir commemoration postage stamps have sold well overseas, with one sheet of 20 stamps selling for nearly $6. In Islamabad, a Pakistan Post official said they had sold more than 300 sheets in recent days at the official rate of about $1.30 apiece. Only 20,000 sheets have been issued, most of which have already sold out, after the spat over the stamps hit the headlines. "
Hawkish,Inventive delight or cynical advert?,2024-09-25,2019-02-01,Nicholas Barber,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20190201-does-the-lego-movie-2-the-second-part-match-the-original,"Set five years after the original, a new film continues the story of Lego figure Emmet – and it fails to measure up, writes Nicholas Barber. Perhaps no sequel could ever have reached the giddy heights attained by The Lego Movie. Written and directed by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, the best cartoon of 2014 was such a magnificently animated and dazzlingly inventive delight that there was probably only one way its follow-up could go. But it is still depressing to see The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part falling so far short of its glorious predecessor. One obvious reason for the shortfall is that the first film caught everyone unawares. Those of us who walked into the cinema fearing a cynical advert for a Danish construction toy brand found ourselves gawping instead at a daring Orwellian satire, the exhilarating and hilarious adventure of a cheerfully conformist construction worker, Emmet (voiced by Chris Pratt), who learns that the tyrannical Lord Business (Will Ferrell) plans to glue every one of Bricksburg’s Lego citizens into place. The second shock came when The Lego Movie threw in characters from different franchises – not just the scene-stealingly sullen Batman (Will Arnett), but Gandalf from The Lord of the Rings, C-3PO from Star Wars and more. And the third shock was that, as well as being a cartoon set in a land where everyone and everything is made of brightly coloured modular plastic, The Lego Movie was revealed at the end to be the story of a boy (Jadon Sand) named Finn, who is shown in a couple of live-action sequences arguing with his father (Will Ferrell, again) about whether Lego should be played with or collected. The sequel lacks these numerous elements of surprise. A second time around, it is no longer a novelty to see characters from separate fictional universes bumping into each other; only a figurine representing a certain US Supreme Court justice is incongruous enough to raise a smile. Moreover, we know from the start that Emmet’s exploits are really just Finn’s games. The last film finished with Bricksburg being invaded by his little sister’s toddler-friendly Duplo bricks, and the new film picks up from there, so it’s clear that whatever happens in the Lego-verse is nothing more than a squabble between a teenage boy and a pre-teen girl. The siblings’ main disagreement concerns whether their games should be gritty or glittery. Five years on from the Duplo invasion, Bricksburg has been reduced to a dystopian desert where the Lego characters divide their time between fighting for survival and gazing moodily into the distance. Only Emmet remains as chirpy as ever. This opening sequence is both a parody of Mad Max and a comment on the adolescent conviction that stories set in post-apocalyptic wastelands are “cooler and more mature” than those which aren’t. But the film doesn’t stay in this setting for long. A generic alien whisks Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks) and a few of her friends off to another galaxy, and Emmett chases after them with the help of Rex Dangervest (also voiced by Pratt), a hard-bitten, perma-stubbled hunk with a fist-shaped spacecraft and a crew of talking velociraptors. As frenetic and fun as these escapades are, the crux of the plot is that an alien queen (Tiffany Haddish) wants to marry Batman, and Batman’s pals don’t want her to because... well, just because. To put it another way, in The Lego Movie our heroes were trying to save civilisation as they knew it. In the sequel, they are trying to stop a wedding. It’s not the same, is it? The conflict makes sense in the live-action world of Finn and his sister: he wants their Lego play sessions to be grim and action-packed, whereas she wants them to be about wedding preparations. But in the cartoon world of Emmet and Wyldstyle, it isn’t too exciting. It isn’t too innovative, either. While Lord and Miller wrote the new film, they handed directing duties over to Mike Mitchell, who made Trolls. What that means is that The Lego Movie 2 is Mitchell’s second cartoon in a row in which plastic figurines act out a battle between girlish positivity and boyish grumpiness, so it’s no wonder it doesn’t feel particularly ground-breaking. What’s more, a lot of the film is set in the real world, where the figurines are afraid of being packed away in storage crates and never being played with again: Mitchell, Lord and Miller have unwisely added Toy Story 3 to the list of cartoons which The Lego Movie sequel resembles but doesn’t quite match. To be fair, they try everything they can to distract us from their film’s relatively uninspired concept. They put in some exuberant songs, although none of them is as awesome as Everything Is Awesome. They complicate the plot with some time-travelling, dimension-hopping high jinks which are almost impossible to follow. They lean into the postmodern self-awareness (much like another Lord-Miller sequel, 22 Jump Street). And they take a quantity-over-quality approach to jokes: I lost count of the times someone said something tough and heroic, only to trip up a second later.   However unsatisfying the film may be, then, there is no mistaking the effort that has gone into it. But that could be the problem. The Lego Movie seemed to be an outpouring of sublime genius. Its sequel seems to be the product of hard labour. It ends up feeling like the forced corporate cash-in that the original cartoon could well have been, but wasn’t. ★★★☆☆ Love film?

Hawkish,Apple designs break from the past,2024-09-25,2013-05-09,Tom Chatfield,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20130509-apple-designs-break-from-the-past,"The tech giant looks like it is ditching its fondness for apps and programs that look like real-world products. Is this a good thing? Why do most smartphones make a clicking noise, like a camera shutter closing, when you take a picture with them? Why do the virtual pages of a book on a tablet appear to turn as you swipe across the screen? The answer is skeuomorphic design, from the Greek words for a tool (skeuos) and shape (morph). It means designing a tool in a new medium that incorporates some of the features of its antecedents. These no long perform any necessary function but – like the unfurling of virtual paper across a digital screen – forge an intuitive link with the past, not to mention being (hopefully) attractive in their own right. Though it sounds obscure, skeuomorphism is everywhere around us – from “retro” detailing on clothes to electric kettles shaped like their stove-top ancestors. It’s also a topic of much hand-wringing and angst in the tech world, thanks to Apple CEO Tim Cook’s decision to shake up the design principles of his company’s iOS mobile operating system – one of the world’s touchstones for digital appearances. The latest incarnation of iOS – version 7 – is likely to be previewed in June ahead of a September release. And its putative appearance is feeding a frenzy of speculation thanks to Cook’s decision in October last year to put hardware supremo Jonathan Ive – the designer responsible for iconic minimalist designs from the iMac and iPod to the iPad – in charge not only of the physical product, but also the look and feel of its software. Ive replaces perhaps the world’s most influential exponent of skeuomorphic software, Scott Forstall, whose work at Apple included creating iOS as we know it – complete with a compass app that looks like a handheld orienteering compass, a notes app mimicking yellow sticky paper, a calculator app designed like an old-fashioned accountant’s pocket calculator, a game centre themed around wood and green baize, and analogue dials on its clocks. Apple’s skeuomorphism has, over the last few years, divided the opinions of designers, to say the least. For author and tech design consultant Adam Greenfield, it’s inexplicable that the company has for so long saddled its exquisite devices with “the most awful and mawkish and flat-out tacky visual cues”; while software developer James Higgs has bluntly described it as “horrific, dishonest and childish crap.” For more sympathetic critics like user interface designer Sacha Greif, meanwhile, the decision to launch the iPhone with such a textured, “realistic” interface was a sensible move given just how novel the device was in 2007. “Nobody,” he argues, “had seen such visual richness in an operating system’s user interface before (let alone on a phone)... Realism was a way to link the future with the past, and make people feel at ease with their new device.” This ease has been important to the company’s success. Outside the rank of designers, few ordinary users are likely to give the subtle stylistic influences of their screens much thought. Yet these are crucial psychological components within a weightless, immaterial medium. Unlike physical materials and the traditions surrounding them, digital pixels have no inherent aesthetic or “feel”. Everything onscreen must be fabricated from scratch – and, for many early users of Apple products, the textured tones of a skeuomorphic interface offered a democratic counterpoint to the elitism of their seamless exteriors. From fake to flat Today, though, even the fanboys agree that some species of revamp is in order – and that Ive’s fondness for modernist minimalism is in line with trends elsewhere. Rather than fake wood and leather, a visual style has emerged in the last few years that is neatly embodied by Microsoft and its technicolour approach to Windows’s latest incarnation. Here, bright square and rectangular panels match a crisp, two-dimensional aesthetic, with an emphasis on clarity and clean blocks of colour. It’s a deliberately “flat” look, embracing the pinpoint resolutions of modern screens rather than softer-edged illusions of weight and depth – and it was heralded by some on its release as “incredibly innovative”. The only problem is that many users don't especially seem to enjoy it – a backlash that has led to embarrassing recent reports of Microsoft preparing to restore some aspects of its older operating systems.      If Apple heads down this path, it will be seeking its own distinctive evolution of Ive’s design philosophy – a philosophy explicitly indebted to the great German designer Dieter Rams and his dictums, the most famous of which states that “good design is as little design as possible.” Some change is likely to be welcomed. But – as Microsoft's experience shows – any reinvention of a widely-used standard breeds a particular gamut of hazards, especially within the open and potentially unanchored spaces of an electronic medium. All digital design is to some extent a game of metaphor and illusion. Yet, increasingly, some of the objects being gestured towards are vanishing from users’ remembered experience. Will the youngest generation of iPad users ever physically have handled analogue dials, desktop calendars or yellowed paper notepads? Will many of them, soon, even have turned the pages of a physical book? These hollowed out metaphors haunt digital design – together with the fear that imitation and repetition risk shackling the present to an increasingly irrelevant past. Successful simplicity, as Ive and Rams have each shown, is about capturing the essence of an experience via the painstaking elimination of anything redundant. How far, though, are skeuomorphism's visual echoes and references themselves essential? Design can never go entirely without mimicry; not least because, if you’re not speaking some kind of common visual language, you cannot make yourself understood. Ive's greatest triumphs at Apple pay explicit tribute to Rams's work at Braun in the 1960s – and it seems unlikely that someone with such a deep sensitivity to its history will abandon onscreen dialogue with the manufactured world. This dialogue is likely to be as much with Apple itself as its antecedents – and to draw deeply on its own aesthetic of industrial design. In the end, though, skeuomorphism is not about wood and leather any more than “flat” design is about colours or rectangles. Each aims at an experience that is its own justification – and that, if the experience should somehow fall short, cannot be saved by all the justifications in the world. As Ive himself put it in a 2012 interview, “we don't really talk about design, we talk about developing ideas and making products.” Once you have a sufficiently complete understanding of what you wish to achieve, the rest is detail.

Hawkish,The reality series dividing viewers,2024-09-25,2020-08-10,Charukesi Ramadurai,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20200806-indian-matchmaking-the-reality-show-that-s-divided-viewers,"Lockdown hit Indian Matchmaking has inspired difficult conversations about the realities of the Indian marriage industry, explains Charukesi Ramadurai. She assesses its impact. Right at the beginning of the Netflix hit show Indian Matchmaking, Sima Taparia, or Sima Mami (Aunty), as she calls herself, declares, “In India we don’t say ‘arranged marriage’. There is marriage and then there is ‘love marriage’.” That is probably the truest statement she makes on this show, which in its first season, takes viewers into the homes and hearts of men and women looking to find a life partner through a matchmaker. These men and women – or boys and girls, as they are referred to in Indian society, perhaps to reinforce their youth and innocence – of Indian origin are in their 20s and 30s, living in India and the US. More like this: -       Why Indians are turning to nostalgic TV -       Matrimania: The changing face of India’s weddings -       The anti-James Bond who’s a hit in India Taparia, who claims to be Mumbai’s top matchmaker, travels frequently to New Jersey, New Delhi, and wherever else her services are required. At home in Mumbai, we see her husband helping her sift through a stack of ‘biodata’ – elaborate profiles of people who have registered with her, complete with head shots – mentally swiping left or right. But then, she also says at some point in the show that “In India, the marriages are between two families”, and so the real test of compatibility in her mind is between the families – or more precisely, their social status. Hate it or love it – and there are enough people who fall in both camps – it’s impossible to ignore Indian Matchmaking, which has inspired conversation, and memes, on social media. And if that is not a measure of the show’s success, then what is? The most popular memes are around an oft-repeated line from Taparia – “My efforts are meaningless if the stars are not aligned” – and her constant emphasis on how her (female) clients need to be “flexible” – in other words, be ready to trade off their dreams for a potentially ideal partner. The Western world views the notion of ‘arranged marriage’ with horrified fascination; how can two adults consent to marry someone chosen for them by others? In India, though, it’s estimated that 90% of all marriages are still arranged, where the onus of finding a ‘suitable’ match for a person is on the family elders. Indian Matchmaking just takes this concept further. As Ankita Bansal, a participant from New Delhi (who eventually chose to focus on her budding business) tells BBC Culture over email, “Matchmaker way, why not? For me it wasn’t very different from being introduced to a guy by a friend or through a dating app. Of course, each of these comes with their own good, bad and ugly. I think the entire experience felt like going on a journey with no idea as to what could turn up next.” Similarly, for Aparna Shewakramani, a lawyer from Houston, it was just another way of meeting new people. “I assumed the matchmaker would work with me, listen to my preferences and use her network to find me the perfect match,” she says. The long history of the matchmaker  There have always been matchmakers and, more recently, marriage agencies that connected families. And every Indian family has a Sima Mami who offers (women) unsolicited, and often blunt, advice to wear more make-up, or hit the gym to lose weight, if they ever hope to get married. Or there are the matrimonial columns in newspapers and on websites, rife with specifications on caste and class, and euphemisms like ‘wheatish complexion’ for someone with a darkish skin tone. As adman and social commentator Santosh Desai writes in his 2010 book Mother Pious Lady: Making Sense of Everyday India – the title a dig at the kind of information matrimonial advertisements think relevant to provide – “a person becomes a bundle of saleable attributes encrypted into matrimonial jargon”. Despite this sociocultural context, Indian Matchmaking has generated a lot of outrage, with critics and viewers alike accusing the show of playing up – or, at the very least, not critiquing – everything regressive in Indian society. Words like hate-watch and cringe-fest have regularly featured on social media. For many women, the show was triggering, because of the way it has shone the spotlight on how intelligent, ambitious, successful women are reduced to a set of stereotypical adjectives. Throughout the show, Taparia comments on how it is easy to find matches for women who are physically attractive, or “tall, fair and trim”, giving rise to accusations that the show promotes colourism. She comments equally on how difficult the process is for women who have a mind of their own, variously describing them as fickle-minded, fussy and stubborn, and advising them to be more “flexible” and open to “compromise.” Aparna (who won my heart when she said “There’s nothing about me that I think I need to change, or evolve, or grow into”) says about this, “It is true that the way this process was portrayed shows different standards for men and women, such as when I am called stubborn for rejecting one match but the men who turn down over 100 women are just unsure.” And male contestant Vyasar Ganesan, a 27-year-old teacher from Texas, spoke to Scroll.in about the casual dismissal of women, calling it “painful to watch”. However, not everyone agrees that all the criticism about this show is valid, saying it merely holds a mirror to Indian society, warts and all. Suchitra Govindarajan, a writer from Bangalore, admits that she was ready to ‘hate-watch’ the show but ended up liking it for its laidback pace – “perfect lockdown viewing” – and the fact that it did not showcase an exotic idea of India to the West. “I’d say that the real world is much more brutal in its discrimination – matchmakers, astrologers and prospective suitors are much more crude and forthright about their expectations,” she says. “Maybe it just makes us flinch when we see it all laid bare on international television?” Govindarajan raises a question many people agree with. Anil Kumar, founder and CEO of matchmaking platform Jodi365.com, tells BBC Culture: “If the show has evoked hashtags such as #CringeBinge, it is because many people in India can identify with the plotlines and characters, and the cringing may be more among progressive elites than the condoning majority.” Producer Smriti Mundhra told Decider that Indian Matchmaking deliberately decided to “not shy away from uncomfortable conversations” such as “the way we prioritise certain things, commodify certain things”. And the show does acknowledge the participants’ anxieties and discomfort with the process, in the way the camera pans repeatedly to the uncertainty or scepticism on their faces, or zooms in on clenched hands that tell their own story. If anything, there are those who feel that Indian Matchmaking glossed over India’s marriage industry, ignoring its dark underbelly. According to Dr Dayal Mirchandani, a psychotherapist from the Indian city of Pune, “Dowry is still a big, ugly issue in India, and I know parents who have gone bankrupt just getting their daughters married.” Referring to finishing schools for brides, where young women are coached on being ideal wives, he adds, “This show is actually like a fairy tale, because the reality is much worse.” Govindarajan echoes that thought, telling BBC Culture: “The women in the show had more freedom and agency than many I know. This is probably due to the focus on privileged people and Indian Americans – although neither of these are guarantees of liberation in Indian society.” Kumar argues that this is merely a drama with the essential ingredients of tension and the conflict between right and wrong. He says, “It is a reality show, with the emphasis on show as much as on reality. So, let’s cut the producers some slack for giving in to commercial considerations and making it more a drama than documentary.”  Ultimately, it is not the duty of a reality show to bring about social change. It is up to the audience to look into the mirror and reflect. As Aparna says, “There is a collective feminine South Asian voice that is coming to the forefront since the show launched, and I believe a lot of good can come from this attention to these issues brought up by the show.” Love film and TV?

Hawkish,The strange beauty of lost rubbish,2024-09-25,2016-04-04,Stuart Haygarth,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20160324-stuart-haygarths-strand-the-strange-beauty-of-lost-rubbish,"When Stuart Haygarth walked the south coast of England, he collected each man-made object he found – and the surprisingly stunning photographs that resulted are collected in a new book. In February 2011, the British artist Stuart Haygarth set off on a 500-mile journey along England's southern coast. His goal: to pick up every single man-made object that he found along the way. These discarded items – shoes, combs, lighters – are what most of us would call rubbish. But the pieces he made from them, including both installations and carefully composed photographs, turn them into art. Now out in a new book, Strand, these photographs ""make strange again the mass-produced objects that fill our lives to the degree that we scarcely perceive them"", Robert Macfarlane writes in the introduction. This excerpt from the book follows Haygarth along the coast through his journal entries. Day 1 Allhallows-on-Sea My journey started with a weekend trip in February 2011 to test the water and to get a taste of things to come. I set off from east London in my 1982 VW camper van, which would be my lodgings for the duration of the trip. The walk began in Allhallows-on-Sea on the Hoo Peninsula in Kent, beside the Allhallows Leisure Park, along lines of permanent static caravans and rows of regimented prefabricated wooden cabins. Further along the coast towards Grain, huge industrial factories belched out grey smoke. The landscape turned marshy, with several tributaries leading to the Thames estuary. I was soon to discover, two hours into this first walk, that estuaries are obstacles best to avoid. A trolley modified to hold all the objects that I would collect turned out to be more of a hindrance than a help: its wheels clogged in clay soil, and the many gates I had to climb meant it became unwieldy and cumbersome. On the horizon, I saw a steady stream of gigantic cargo ships pass by on the Thames. Day 2 Sheerness The beach begins with shingle and endless rows of groyns installed to prevent longshore drift. There are groups of Sunday dog walkers on the early stretch of coast because there is a safe concrete promenade. At regular intervals, artificial wooden benches are positioned with personal family memorial plaques, several displaying withered bunches of flowers. There are no people beyond the promenade because from here the beach becomes wet and muddy with heavy soil. I discover a couple of shipwrecks resembling the carcasses of beached whales, just the decaying hulls remaining. Rusty vehicle components lie partially buried in the ground. An enormous tractor tyre tipped on its side has become a miniature swimming pool brimming with seawater. On my right-hand side are steep, intimidating clay cliffs showing signs of wet mudslides after weeks of heavy rain. My plywood box is completely full and I struggle like a pit pony through the sticky mud. I decide that a carrying system on my back will be much more efficient than the trolley. Day 4 Margate Walking at the base of vertical chalky cliffs for most of the day, I had to focus my attention on the tide and exit points. The beaches were deserted because of the overcast day and strong winds. Margate is like a ghost town, symbol of a bygone age of British beach holidays. Boarded-up and decaying buildings with a series of seawater-filled lidos from a different era. The coast walls are covered in chalk graffiti, chunks of chalk littering the promenade. Walking around the belly of the Isle of Thanet, I soon reached Broadstairs with its cute harbour, boats, brightly painted beach huts and an old-style fun fair. The beach defences were coated in a myriad of green hues and textures resembling large canvases of abstract art. I found little of interest to collect but stumbled across a long pink plastic penis wedged in between some rocks on the cliff face. It turned out to be a novelty straw, which made me smile and feel like an archaeologist discovering an ancient drinking implement. Day 9 Greatstone-on-Sea The sun had brought families to the beach. Cricket, kite-flying and land yachting were in progress. I noticed a sign warning of an infestation of brown-tail moth caterpillars, and sure enough I could see hundreds from where I was standing. A moat with a lonely chair was left from the previous day’s play. I walked past a flimsy wooden fence laden with pieces of rubbish, carefully positioned to create some kind of totem. The sand changed to wide-open shingle with hardy vegetation growing in scattered clumps. The area around Dungeness is an intriguing and surreal mix: old fishermen’s huts, 1970s retirement homes and newly designed iroko-clad modernist weekend retreats are overlooked by the gigantic and imposing nuclear power station. Beyond here, the coast becomes yet another danger area, a military playground barren apart from abandoned tanks and lookout posts. This area was a treasure trove for flotsam and jetsam. My rucksack was crammed with objects, heavy and cumbersome. I arrived exhausted at Camber Holiday Park and phoned for a taxi to take me back to the camper van. Ten minutes later, I was speeding towards Littlestone with a speed freak lady driver. She moaned about everything – the royal wedding, other drivers, her injured ankle – all except her love of driving. Day 16 Hayling Island Today was the first rainy day of my walk, so I reluctantly swapped my shorts for a pair of waterproof trousers. Hayling Island does not quite live up to its rather seductive name: amusement arcades, fast-food kiosks and not much else. Even the gale could not deter the many golfers, still going strong. As I walked west along Stokes Bay, the sun came out and my damp clothes began to dry. Southampton Water is a popular sailing area, with small yachts bouncing around on the swell, a stark contrast to the gigantic cruise ships that slowly creep by. I was soon walking through the former Browndown army training camp and nature reserve, which was great for collecting objects. The area had a series of large concrete mushroom structures, no doubt linked to the military in some way. In the distance, I could see the industrial skyline of Southampton and a refinery with smoking chimneys, the smell of oil in the salty air. Tonight there was a full moon over the Solent with views across to the Isle of Wight. I fell asleep to the sound of the wind and the van rocking. Day 26 Dawlish Warren At Dawlish, the train tracks hug the Devon coastline, sandwiched in between the sculpted terracotta sandstone cliffs. Today was mainly cliff-top walking, with access to very few beaches. The idyllic coves that I managed to find were clean, so my rucksack remained light. At Teignmouth, I had to circumnavigate the estuary by heading inland to cross over a bridge, adding a couple of miles to my journey. At St Marychurch, I stopped for a short rest. Dog owners threw sticks for their pets, which returned them swiftly, hungry for more play. A small Yorkshire terrier sniffed curiously at my rucksack on the grass and nonchalantly urinated on it before I had a chance to react. The owner apologised, smiled and walked away. The sun was setting as I entered Torbay. I passed rows of luxurious houses with spectacular sea views; tourists were out in force drinking by the harbour. The taxi driver who returned me to the van was a curious-looking character, a tiny man of boyish proportions but with thinning white hair. The film The Curious Tale of Benjamin Button sprang to mind. I had noticed there were many German tourists in Torquay; the driver explained that it was because Fawlty Towers was set and filmed there: they came in search of Basil Fawlty. Day 38 Land’s End Constant hard rain and wind. My right boot is letting in water because the seal has broken near the heel, so my foot squelches. There are huge crashing waves, attracting thrill-seeking surfers. Absolutely no one is walking the South West Coast Path today. On a small beach, I found what looked like a decapitated shark with chunks bitten from its torso. I passed the remains of solid stone towers and buildings left from the slate-mining days. Collecting was good, probably due to the recent stormy weather. At Porthcurno, I visited the open-air Minack Theatre, founded by the visionary Rowena Cade, who created a Greek-style amphitheatre on the slope of the cliff face. The light was failing as I reached Land’s End and the skies were dramatic and painterly. Land’s End itself was disappointing. On my arrival, I was confronted with a gigantic car park that was empty apart from two camper vans. In typical vulgar style, there was an array of amusement arcades, gift shops and a cinema showing undersea movies; further along, there was a pub and a charmless modern hotel. I felt melancholy mixed with pleasure at having achieved my goal. Extracted from Strand by Stuart Haygarth, published by Art / Books.

Hawkish,Is this Australia's best-kept secret?,2024-09-25,2020-07-07,Ellie Cobb,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20200706-australias-answer-to-the-northern-lights,"Although it seems obvious there would be a southern equivalent to the northern lights, the Aurora Australis might be the southern hemisphere’s best-kept secret. “Can you remind me why we’re here?” my husband asked, sounding slightly annoyed. I’d promised him a mini break by the sea, sans kids for the first time in five years. What the reality looked like, however, was pouring rain in a tiny Tasmanian town where low-rise houses were huddled by grey, choppy water and nary a shop in sight. It was winter and freezing cold. I could understand why he was less than impressed. We’d just arrived in Southport, the most southern township in Australia, where we were staying at a deserted caravan park that declared itself “The Last Stop in Tassie” – whether that was proudly or despondently, I wasn’t quite sure. My husband also didn’t yet know that I had an ulterior motive to our child-free break. I’d been hearing more and more over the last few years about the Aurora Australis, the southern sibling to the Northern Lights. Although tourists flock to see the colourful, dancing lights that sweep across the skies in high-latitude regions from Canada to Iceland, few seem to know that the southern hemisphere has its own equally magical lightshow – and I was determined to see it. “I feel like this is Australia’s birthright. And people just don’t know about it,” said Margaret Sonnemann, author of the Aurora Chaser’s Handbook and founder of the Aurora Australis Tasmania Facebook page. The Southern (and Northern) Lights can be seen around the magnetic poles when the upper atmosphere is hit by energetic charged particles that travel along the Earth’s magnetic field lines. When those energetic electrons collide with gases in the atmosphere, they emit light. “They occur when there’s a release of energy due to collisions between polar atmospheric gases of the Earth and precipitating high-energy charged particles guided by geomagnetic field from the magnetotail,” said Dr Rakesh Panwar at the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, Space Weather Services. He explained that they are seen mostly at high or polar latitudes, but occasionally may be seen at middle latitudes when a large solar event occurs. Although it’s true that the Southern Lights have been seen from mainland Australia, they’re more commonly seen from Australia’s island-state of Tasmania (or from New Zealand), due to its clear skies and proximity to the pole, which is why I’d dragged my husband 600km south from Melbourne. I wasn’t the only one fascinated by the magic of these dancing lights. Sonnemann, an American who moved to Tasmania 32 years ago, told me that she got hooked on aurora chasing back in 2005 when she was driving south to Hobart, the state capital. Although it wasn’t the first aurora she had seen, she said it was the most captivating. It was happening behind her as she drove, reaching up to the heavens, straight above her head. “It was pretty much a black-and-white experience, but the movement of the beams was magical,” she said. “It changed dramatically from second to second, shooting up into the sky. It was beautiful and exhilarating.” You may also be interested in:  • The food that defines Australia  • A ruggedly beautiful quarantine site   • Australia's bizarre coastal desert Although Sonnemann knew other locals who were interested in aurora chasing, there was no central source of information to draw on to find out when and where they were happening. She realised that a notification system was needed. “Since auroras are weather dependent, we needed to be able to not only say ‘it’s happening now’, but where it was happening,” she said. Sonnemann started her Facebook page in 2010, mostly with a handful of interested locals (it now has more than 85,000 members and 10 admins). “But it quickly became photographers,” she said. “That’s because aurora photography can be the best way to see the lights.” She said that although people associate auroras with streaks of colour lighting up the sky, in Tasmania, you’ll likely see a white light without a camera, perhaps with some coloured glow around it, unless there’s enough cosmic activity to make the aurora big enough. “You can’t see a lot of colour with the naked eye, as our eyes are not designed to see colour at night,” she explained. “To see strong colour, [the aurora] needs to be very bright.” However, use a camera and the results can be spectacular. Ask Sonnemann what she loves most about the Aurora Australis, and her face lights up. She’s passionate about the topic and it makes sense when she tells me that people call her the “Aurora Lady”. “One of the nice things about our auroras is that most of them are not overhead,” she said, explaining that Tasmania is much further from the South Pole than many northern hemisphere aurora hotspots are to the North Pole. “What that means for photographers is that they get a better variety of colours if they’re looking at something that’s on the horizon. If you look at aurora photos from spots in the northern hemisphere, they're often green, which is pretty much the colour you’re going to get if it’s overhead. Because we’re looking more towards the horizon, we get just about every colour: red, greens, yellows, blues and purples.” “I like to say that it’s like seeing music,” she added, smiling. Aurora Australis tips Camera settings: What’s also unique about the Southern Lights is that they can be seen year-round. Although many people (myself included) assume that aurora chasing is a winter sport; that’s because northern hemisphere aurora spots have the midnight sun in summer. In the southern hemisphere, whether you’re in Tasmania, New Zealand or even parts of southern Victoria, you’ve got a real possibility of seeing an aurora in mild summer weather, although you’ll have to stay up later as it doesn’t get dark until 21:00 or 22:00. And the lights can be equally stunning, ranging from intense white pillars in the sky to ethereal streaks of greens and reds. However, I’d clearly picked a bad weekend, with murky skies and fat drops of rain. One Southport local told us that he can often see the aurora from his back deck in summer. But not this time of year. Come back when it’s clear weather, he said. He was right. The sky was a blanket of grey cloud, and later, when it got dark, there was nothing to be seen in the thick, inky blackness. However, when I’d met with Sonnemann earlier that day, she’d told me that I’d made another incorrect assumption – I didn’t need to be staking out Australia’s southernmost spot for my best chance of seeing the lights. “Preferably you need to be away from city lights, but you can see them anywhere in this state,” she said. “You need a clear view to the south, so no hills, no trees. It’s just as good all over Tasmania, whether you’re in Devonport or Hobart. Anywhere where it’s darkish. You can see it in your own back yard. So, the next morning we packed up and fled the tiny town for Bruny Island, two islands connected by an isthmus across the D'Entrecasteaux Channel from Southport. Bruny Island has a wealth of delights to interest the traveller, from its world-famous cheese to its unique white wallabies, so I figured there would be plenty to do even if we were thwarted by the fickle light show. The island is so remote that even without an aurora the night skies can be magical, with the Milky Way on full show and a blanket of stars cossetting you. We drove from the ferry terminal, past wineries, breweries and cheese shops to our accommodation, down a single road with dense gums on either side that occasionally broke rank to give a startling view of the glistening ocean. The accommodation I’d booked had a 180-degree panorama over Cloudy Bay, where lulling waves broke into white-crested spumes as they flopped onto the shore, which was a strip of golden sandy beach surrounded by thickly forested hills of blue gum and stringybark. It was spectacularly beautiful. “This is a photographer’s dream,” said Ben Kienhuis, operations manager at Bruny Island Coastal Retreats, as he unlocked the front door and showed us in. He was right. From the living room window was a clear view across the bay, with nothing blocking our sightline to the horizon. This, I hoped, would be the place to see the ethereal aurora. Kienhuis explained that the night skies here can be so spectacular that his team have recently started offering aurora photography tours, which take amateur photographers to various locations on the island to take in the glory of these clear southern skies and, hopefully, the Aurora Australis. They believe their new aurora tour is the first of its kind in Tasmania. “The auroras can be spectacular,” said photographer Luke Tscharke, who runs the tours with Kienhuis. “But there’s no aurora tourism [in Tasmania],” he added. “You don’t see people advertising to take you out to see the Southern Lights because it’s just so challenging to predict or guarantee that you’d see them.” But the thrill of the chase is clearly part of the fun. To help me with my search, Sonnemann had introduced me to various apps and meteorological sites that are designed to help the amateur aurora chaser, which detail the wind speed, the Bz (the orientation of the interplanetary magnetic field) and the K-index (the level of disturbance in the Earth’s magnetic field), among other indicators. Combined, they give a guide as to the probability of an aurora happening. Facebook groups, such as Sonnemann’s, are also an excellent place to find out from locals on the ground where and when an aurora might occur. Understanding the readings was complex but addicting. I found myself feverishly checking the app on my phone, hoping for a change in conditions that might bring the aurora to me. “There are never any guarantees,” Sonnemann reminded me. “People say, ‘I’ve heard this prediction…’, but you never know.” Yet, despite the elusiveness of the lights, there’s been a surge in interest in the Aurora Australis over the last few years. Sonnemann explained that most of the members on her page are now not locals and photographers, but international tourists who want to see the aurora. Her concern is that there’s currently no infrastructure to handle them. “It really disturbs me that we have people coming down here, from places like Singapore, who have never seen a dark sky before, and are petrified of driving in the dark,” she said. “Their whole lives have been fully lit. They’ve never seen ‘dark’. So they end up flying down and don’t even go out. They don’t want to drive in it. I just think that’s horrible.” To try to meet the demand, she’s working on a project to create aurora viewing platforms, which she envisages as sheltered spots that people can drive or taxi to, where they’ll find explanatory signage and photography tips ­– and likely other aurora chasers. “Even if there’s not an aurora – and there’s not one every night – they might be seeing the Milky Way for the first time,” Sonnemann said. “They can still see a beautiful night sky, even if there’s no aurora.” That night I stayed up late, staring at the thick cloudy sky through the windows. The K-index was hovering at one and the wind speed was low, meaning an aurora was unlikely. It was freezing cold, and I fell asleep in front of the fire. Around 02:00, I woke up, startled by a noise perhaps, or maybe a sense that something was going to happen. I opened the sliding doors and stood in front of the bay, the frigid air pressing into me on all sides and making it hard to breathe. I looked up into the thick night sky. There was no aurora. But the clouds had finally cleared, leaving a never-ending blackness punctuated with stars. I stood there quietly, listening to the gentle roar of the ocean that stretched, unhindered, all the way to the South Pole. I should have been disappointed, of course, but for some reason I wasn’t. Perhaps it was the magic of the experience or the magnitude of sky; whatever it was, I was sure that the aurora would reveal itself to me when the time was right. For now, though, I drank in the solitude, the space, the silence. Whether or not I was ever going to see the Southern Lights, I knew that I was glad to be here, on an island off an island off an island on the very edge of the world.

Hawkish,Protesters condemn 'short-sighted' hospital plans,2024-09-25,2024-01-24,By Brodie Owen & Kevin Hay,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-68085906,"Protesters have urged the NHS to reconsider ""short-sighted"" plans to close a community hospital and hand back wards at two others. NHS Devon has proposed closing Teignmouth Hospital and offloading vacant space at Seaton Hospital and Okehampton Hospital to save money. Ahead of a Devon County Council meeting on the issue, protesters described the plans as ""wrong"". NHS Devon said in a report it faced a £42m budget deficit in 2023-24. The BBC has contacted the trust for further comment. The council's Health and Adult Care Scrutiny Committee voted not to pressure the secretary of state for health over the planned closure of Teignmouth Hospital. However, the committee asked for another report into the Seaton plans, while no decision was made about Okehampton. Councillor Chris Clarance, Teignbridge District Council chairman, said he was disappointed by the decision not to refer the matter to the health secretary. ""It was terrible,"" he said. ""It was not what I was expecting... I was hoping the committee would stick with the original task group's finding to refer only for them to U-turn."" Viv Wilson, a campaigner, said Teignmouth Hospital was an ""essential"" part of the community. She argued NHS plans for a new health and wellbeing centre in the town would not meet demand. ""The decision to close Teignmouth Hospital is wrong,"" she said. ""The hospital is an essential part of the health and wellbeing of that particular part of Devon - their proposal to spend £23m on a health hub, which is not a hospital, just really won't fit the bill."" Martin Shaw, from Seaton Hospital Steering Committee, said NHS Devon's plans to hand back a two-storey wing to its property service was ""short-sighted"". ""Cuts don't have to be made in this way,"" he said. ""It matters to me because I live in a small town which is a long way from the acute hospital."" Jan Goffey, a former mayor of Okehampton, said similar plans to hand back an empty ward would cost the community ""far more"" than the NHS would save. ""Elderly patients don't heal as well if they are far away from their family and friends,"" she added. In a report presented to councillors, NHS Devon said it faced ""severe financial challenges"". ""In 2023/24... the forecast deficit for the county's NHS system as a whole is £42.3m, which includes a £212m savings plan,"" it said. ""We are £32.5m adrift from where we expected to be against our plan."" Follow BBC Devon on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram. Send your story ideas to spotlight@bbc.co.uk."
Hawkish,MP criticises delays in setting up banking hubs,2024-09-25,2024-01-28,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-68122746,"A Devon MP has criticised delays in setting up banking hubs in areas where bank branches have closed. The last bank in Teignmouth and Dawlish is to close in April, and a banking hub is still to be developed. Anne-Marie Morris, Conservative MP for Newton Abbot, said the gap needed to be closed so older and vulnerable people could continue face-to-face banking. Cash Access UK, which owns the banking hubs, said it was a challenge to secure the right premises. According to Citizens Advice UK, about 6,000 high street bank branches have closed since 2015, but only 31 banking hubs have been set up.  The opening of new hubs can take months as a suitable premise needs to be found and often changes are needed to ensure it is fully accessible and secure enough for banking services. Ms Morris said a new set of criteria should be agreed the development of banking hubs. ""There are lots and lots of barriers,"" she said. ""You need to fight for a hub and even if it's approved, it's down to cash access to find a property, but constraints to size and location mean it can be very difficult to find the right place."" The Citizen's Advice Bureau reports that almost 6,000 high street bank branches have closed since 2015 while only 31 banking hubs have been created, the House of Lords says. Perran Moon, the Labour candidate for Camborne and Redruth, said it was an ""absolute travesty"" nearly 1,000 bank branches had closed across the South West and he called the region a ""banking desert"". He said: ""It's the most vulnerable, it's pensioners and, critically in the South West, it's the small businesses that are so reliant on these high street banks."" Cat Farrow, the chief operating officer of Cash Access UK, said it was hoping to open more hubs as soon as possible. ""Cash Access UK is looking to provide services that will be there for years to come, are centrally located and fully accessible to customers and staff,"" she said. ""Finding the right property can sometimes be a challenge. Not all properties are suitable, sustainable or secure to host a hub.  ""Sometimes, we find that a landlord would prefer their building to be used for hospitality or residential space.  ""When considering our options on buildings, we always appreciate the local knowledge to help secure premises."" Follow BBC Devon on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

Hawkish,Man arrested after eight school burglaries,2024-09-25,2024-01-30,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-68140069,"A man has been arrested in connection with reported burglaries at four Devon schools, police have said. Devon and Cornwall Police have been investigating eight reports of incidents in the Teignbridge area since October. All happened when the schools were empty, and some resulted in cash and electronic devices being stolen. A 28-year-old man from Dawlish has been arrested on suspicion of burglary, police said. The reported incidents were at Teignmouth Primary on Sunday, at Gatehouse Primary in Dawlish on Sunday and on 1 January, at Starcross Primary on 13 January and at Oakwood College in Dawlish on three occasions in October, December and January. A Gatehouse Primary Academy spokesperson said the school was closed on Monday to allow police to carry out an investigation. The school reopened on Tuesday. Police said they had reviewed CCTV footage following each report and the arrested man remained in police custody. Sector Inspector Sean Roper said: ""These incidents have had an impact on the school communities within Teignbridge, with some schools having to stay closed following the burglaries due to the damage caused. ""We have been working closely with the schools to carry out investigations at scenes where possible and seize any CCTV, forensics and make enquiries in the local areas.  ""The Neighbourhood Teams have been engaged with the schools and I would like to thank them in their support of our investigations over the past few months.""

Hawkish,US approves plan for strikes on Iranian targets,2024-09-25,2024-02-01,By Bernd Debusmann Jr & Tom Bateman ,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68171280,"The US has approved plans for a series of strikes on Iranian targets in Syria and Iraq, officials have told the BBC's US partner CBS News. The strikes will take place over a number of days, officials said, and weather conditions will likely dictate when they are launched. It comes after a drone attack killed three US soldiers in Jordan, close to the Syrian border, on Sunday. The US blamed an Iranian-backed militia group for that attack. That group, the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, is believed to contain multiple militias that have been armed, funded and trained by Iran's Revolutionary Guards force. It has said it was responsible for Sunday's strike.  Iran, meanwhile, has denied any role in the attack which injured 41 other US troops at the military base, known as Tower 22.  US officials have said that US intelligence believes that the drone used to attack the facility was manufactured by Iran - and is similar to the drones Iran has been sending to Russia for its invasion of Ukraine.  At a news conference on Thursday, US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin defended the delayed military response, saying: ""We will respond where we choose, when we choose and how we choose."" ""I think everyone recognises the challenge associated with making sure that we hold the right people accountable,"" he said, adding that there is no ""set formula for doing this"". ""There are ways to manage this so it doesn't spiral out of control. And that's been our focus throughout,"" Mr Austin continued. The officials who spoke to CBS News did not give an exact timeline on the potential strikes. They said the US military could launch them in bad weather, but preferred to have better visibility to reduce the risk of inadvertently hitting civilians. President Joe Biden has been under mounting pressure from Republican lawmakers, including some of Washington's most hawkish voices on Iran, to strike targets on Iranian soil.  But while the US has repeatedly pledged to respond to the drone attack, Mr Biden and other defence officials have said Washington is not seeking a wider war with Iran or an escalation of tensions in the region.  ""That's not what I'm looking for,"" Mr Biden told reporters at the White House earlier this week. The reportedly approved plans appear to keep the targeting to Iranian targets Syria and Iraq, rather than inside Iran.  Several Iran-backed groups have increased attacks on US and Israeli-linked entities since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas war on 7 October.  The Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen, for example, have attacked ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, prompting strikes from the US and its allies. A US defence official told CBS that a drone was shot down overnight in the Gulf of Aden, while an unmanned sea drone was struck and destroyed in the Red Sea.  Citing unnamed sources, Reuters on Thursday reported that Iran had withdrawn senior officials from Syria following a series of Israeli airstrikes in a bid to avoid being directly drawn into a wider conflict in the region.  US officials told CNN this week that there were signs that the Iranian government was becoming increasingly concerned about the actions of its proxy groups in the region, who have launched over 160 attacks on US forces since October.  The bodies of the three US soldiers killed in the attack in Jordan are expected to be repatriated to a Delaware Air Force base on Friday. The White House has announced that President Biden will attend.  The three soldiers have been named as William Jerome Rivers, 46, Kennedy Ladon Sanders, 24, and Breonna Alexsondria Moffett, 23. All three were part of an army reserve unit based in Fort Moore, Georgia. "

Hawkish,Haley and DeSantis to face off in Iowa debate,2024-09-25,2024-01-10,By Bernd Debusmann Jr & Matt Murphy,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-67938594,"Florida Governor Ron DeSantis will face off against former UN ambassador Nikki Haley in the last Republican debate before the Iowa caucus next week. The debate in Des Moines comes as both candidates lag far behind former President Donald Trump in the polls. The 15 January caucus will be the candidates' first electoral test in their effort to become the Republican presidential nominee in 2024. Mr Trump will not attend the debate but will appear in a Fox News town hall. He has so far boycotted every Republican debate and holds commanding poll leads in Iowa ahead of the caucuses. The CNN debate, which is scheduled for 21:00 EST (02:00 GMT), offers Mr DeSantis and Ms Haley, who stand in second and third place in the polls respectively, a final opportunity to make their case to Iowans ahead of next week. Two other candidates, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, failed to qualify. Mr Christie announced he was dropping out of the race on Wednesday just hours before the debate. Meanwhile, there was last-minute sparring between Ms Haley and Mr DeSantis over the airwaves, with a pro-Haley ad criticising the Florida governor for allegedly mischaracterising her comments on Gaza, immigration and Hillary Clinton. The ad was entitled ""DeSantis is lying because he's losing"". A super PAC that supports Mr DeSantis also released an ad in Iowa which attacked Ms Haley for saying that the upcoming New Hampshire primary - the second Republican contest - would ""correct"" the results of Iowa. ""Nikki Haley told New Hampshire what she really thinks about Iowa,"" the narrator says in the video. Ms Haley was recently buoyed by fresh polling that suggests she has cut Mr Trump's lead in New Hampshire to single digits. Analysts have said a strong showing there could make her Republican party's prime alternative pick to the former president. Since serving as Mr Trump's ambassador to the UN during his time in the White House, she has broken with her one-time boss on key areas of foreign policy and criticised his willingness to do business with China.  She has seemed to promise a return to a more traditional Republican party, embracing a hawkish foreign policy and faulting members of both parties, including Mr Trump, for running up the national debt. A former South Carolina governor, Ms Haley has also argued that she is a more palatable candidate for undecided voters than Mr Trump. But as her star has ascended in recent weeks, she has faced increased attacks from Mr Trump and Mr DeSantis.  She was also criticised after she failed to say that the Civil War was fought over the issue of slavery. By contrast, Mr DeSantis, the two term Florida governor, has sought to tack hard to Mr Trump's right.  He has fought a campaign based broadly on culture wars issues and has touted his record of tackling what he called ""woke"" policies in his home state.  While an early favourite as an alternative choice to Mr Trump, he has struggled to differentiate himself from his one-time ally. The former president raised Mr DeSantis from relative obscurity as a member of Congress and endorsed him in his run for the Florida governor's office in 2017. It does appear that Mr DeSantis is better suited to perform well in Iowa than Ms Haley, where evangelical voters, a key voting block in the state, could be attracted to his staunch conservative values.  Nevertheless, both candidates will likely have to exceed expectations to step out from under Mr Trump's shadow and keep their campaigns alive."
Hawkish,'We are surrounded': Guarding the Middle East's most dangerous border,2024-09-25,2024-02-08,By Jeremy Bowen,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68231543,"It is a lonely drive to Israel's most northern town, Metula, along a spur of land that is surrounded on three sides by Lebanon. That means it is also surrounded on three sides by Lebanon's most powerful armed group, Hezbollah.  The soldiers at the checkpoint on the edge of Metula were all local men, mostly middle-aged reservists with no illusions about the force on the other side of the border.  As the rain lashed down on a miserable, foggy night, one of them, who did not want his name to be published, used his finger to traverse the compass, pointing to the border and Hezbollah's positions.  ""To the west a quarter of a mile, to north half a mile and another half mile to the east. So, we are 300 degrees surrounded by the Hezbollah."" The other 60 degrees, he said, included the steep road back down to the rest of Israel.  The Gaza war that started after Hamas attacked on 7 October, killing around 1,200 Israelis, mostly civilians, has been devastating. The Israeli offensive that followed has, so far, killed well over 27,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, and inflicted severe damage on Gaza.  The border conflict between Israel and Hezbollah that followed has steadily intensified, but all sides know how much worse it would get if it exploded into a high-intensity war. It was stark and clear to the men on guard on the edge of Metula.  The Israeli reservist continued: ""Yes, it definitely can turn into a big war and a big war with Hezbollah is not like Hamas, they are a real army, very trained, greatly equipped and they have a lot of experience, real experience in Syria."" Hezbollah intervened in the war in Syria, fighting for the regime of President Bashar al-Assad.  The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has no plans to visit Metula on his current Middle East tour, but the long flight from Washington and the travelling times between different capitals in the Middle East must be grimly familiar to him by now. He is back in the region for the fifth time since 7 October.  Mr Blinken has not tried to minimise the magnitude of the crisis in the Middle East. At the end of January, standing next to the secretary general of Nato, he said it was ""incredibly volatile… I would argue that we have not seen a situation as dangerous as the one we're facing now across the region since at least 1973, and arguably even before that."" That is quite a comparison. The Middle East war of 1973 turned into one of the most dangerous superpower confrontations of the Cold War. With US President Richard Nixon submerged by the Watergate scandal, his Secretary of State Henry Kissinger ordered US strategic forces on to their highest level of peacetime alert, Defcon 3, after a report that the USSR was moving nuclear weapons to the Middle East.  Half a century on Mr Blinken was speaking after militias trained and funded by Iran killed three American soldiers at a base in Jordan. Since then the US, helped in Yemen by the UK, has started a rolling campaign of retaliatory air strikes. The Americans hope they have calibrated their response to stabilise matters, not make them worse, but that is not at all certain.  Hawkish critics of President Biden in Washington DC say that action taken so far will not deter Iran, which backs Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen as well as Shia militias in Syria and Iraq. The hawks say only attacks on Iran itself will force Tehran to order its proxies and allies to stand down. The Biden administration believes attacking Iran itself risks detonating a wider conflict in the Middle East.  On previous trips Secretary Blinken has repeatedly expressed America's support for Israel's war against Hamas, but also grave doubts about the way Israel is fighting. Washington has called, unsuccessfully, for restraint. The US has continued to supply Israel with the weapons it needs for its campaign, despite its reservations about the way they are being used.  The US has had more success in forcing Israel to let in much more humanitarian aid to more than two million Palestinian civilians who are trapped in the catastrophe. Last October, Israeli leaders said nothing would be allowed in. Even so, the UN and aid groups active in Gaza say Israel has not allowed in anything close to what they need. Hardened aid officials with long careers trying to help civilians in warzones have told me they have never seen anything as bad. One who has been inside Gaza multiple times in the last few months (journalists are not allowed in by Israel and Egypt, who control the borders) said he had ""never seen anything of this size, scale and depth"". Mr Blinken's top priority is securing a ceasefire in Gaza. President Biden needs to calm the Middle East, not just because of the terrible risks of a continued and escalating war, but because he faces elections this year. Polls suggest he is losing votes as some Americans blame his support for Israel for the humanitarian catastrophe inside Gaza.  A renewed burst of diplomacy, involving the US, Qatar, Egypt and Israel, produced broad parameters for a deal but no details.  Hamas has delivered its terms. It wants a three-stage process lasting 135 days, which would allow a phased exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. It has put forward a long list of demands. The most significant is that by the end of that time Israel would have pulled its forces out of Gaza and the war would be over.   All that was dismissed by Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu after his meeting with Secretary of State Blinken.  Since the war started, Israel has defined victory as the destruction of Hamas and the safe return home of the hostages. Neither objective has yet been achieved. Mr Netanyahu said Israel would not make concessions to Hamas, and repeated his insistence that its forces were closing in on ""total victory"". In recent days, he has also said Israel needed to kill Hamas leaders.  Mr Blinken still believes, he said later, that a deal is possible. His challenge is to try to narrow the gap between the diametrically opposed positions of Israel and Hamas to get some sort of ceasefire. The BBC's information is that Hamas is much less confident than it was early in the war. The ferocity of Israel's assault and the killing of so many civilians means that Gazans trapped in the war are turning against Hamas, making its leaders realise they need to try negotiation.  In Israel, for all the determined talk emerging from the prime minister and his allies, pressure is growing for a ceasefire to create an opportunity for a deal to get the hostages back.  It is not much for Mr Blinken to work with. The odds look to be against a ceasefire unless either or both sides make substantial concessions.

Hawkish,Reluctant statesman Sunak turns focus to foreign affairs,2024-09-25,2024-01-19,By James Landale,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-67884751,"When Rishi Sunak entered 10 Downing Street in October 2022, he had little experience in foreign affairs. His priorities were largely domestic: to try to repair the UK economy after the Covid pandemic and revive the Conservative Party's electoral fortunes.  Yet in recent days the prime minister has asserted himself on the global stage more emphatically than many might have expected.  He has gone to war against the Houthis in Yemen, the only European leader to send armed force to join the United States-led air strikes.  He has put Britain at the forefront of the pro-Ukraine alliance, promising increased military support and signing a new security pact with Kyiv, all while US and European Union allies hesitate amid division and fatigue.  I travelled with Mr Sunak on his recent trip to Kyiv and saw first-hand how the prime minister handled both the Red Sea and Ukraine crises at the same time. And what struck me was how far Mr Sunak has had to come in the 15 months he has been in office, from reluctant statesman to engaged international actor.  When the prime minister replaced Liz Truss, his foreign policy appeared limited to promising continued support for Ukraine. Calling President Macron of France ""a friend"" was seen as a bold act compared to his predecessor's hesitation. Mr Sunak's five priorities were mostly domestic: the only foreign consideration was stopping boats of migrants crossing the English Channel.  As his first year in office progressed, the prime minister showed at times what seemed like introspective instincts. He fluttered diplomatic feathers by ordering a corporate-style audit of UK military support for Ukraine.  At the G20 summit in New Delhi, he seemed more focused on national matters - fostering a UK-India trade deal, talking to EU partners about his migration policy.  Mr Sunak chose not to attend the United Nations General Assembly in New York. I spent much time there being asked by diplomats why the new prime minister stayed away, missing an opportunity to meet many world leaders. In November, the PM snubbed his Greek counterpart, cancelling a meeting at short notice after Kyriakos Mitsotakis demanded the return of the Parthenon Marbles during a BBC interview. And while Mr Sunak has chosen so far not to visit Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz in Berlin, he has attended a conference of right-wing parties in Italy.  The view in Whitehall was that Mr Sunak was uninterested in foreign affairs, more engaged on electoral and economic priorities. This impression was confirmed to many by the appointment of Lord Cameron as foreign secretary. Diplomats and officials interpreted this as Mr Sunak outsourcing foreign affairs to a more experienced predecessor. The prime minister all but confirmed this impression at the Liaison Committee before Christmas. Asked by one MP if he considered himself a leader on the world stage, he wriggled visibly with discomfort. ""I think others will make that determination,"" he said.  Yet only a few weeks later Mr Sunak has put British servicemen and women in harm's way, making choices other European heads of government have avoided. So what has changed?  One answer is that he had no choice but to respond to global events. As he admitted to the Liaison Committee: ""The increasingly complex and hostile international environment is something that, over the past year, has occupied more of my time than one might have anticipated."" A second answer is that he was always ready to be proactive on the world stage, just in a different way.  Take Ukraine. Where Boris Johnson was an instinctive supporter of Kyiv, Mr Sunak is more rational, talking about ""investing"" in European security. ""The difference is that the PM is pragmatic, as opposed to Johnson who was philosophically all-in,"" one senior defence source told me.  Mr Sunak's advisers say that when he engages with foreign policy in detail and reaches a conclusion, he can be as hawkish as Mr Johnson, if not more so. They say he has a greater risk appetite than some imagine.  They point to his early support for Ukraine getting tanks and long-range missiles, not fearing the threat of Russian escalation. And in the Red Sea, they note his readiness to deploy RAF warplanes when many European allies - such as the French and Italians - demurred.  That said, Mr Sunak's domestic instincts can still stay his hand. Whitehall sources say serious consideration was given to promising Ukraine a multi-year package of military support - not just one year - to send a clear signal of UK strategic patience to Moscow.  But those sources say Mr Sunak became all ""chancellorish"" and saw the issue through the prism of Treasury rules. There were discussions about whether part of the money could be promised for some years, a technical solution that muddied waters and was dropped.  A third pointer to Mr Sunak's increased global activism is simply time. The longer prime ministers are in office, the more they find foreign affairs unavoidable and at times alluring, compared to the messy compromises of home.  This was apparent when Mr Sunak addressed Ukraine's parliament, an emotional event where MPs bellowed their national anthem, held a minute's silence for the dead and cheered the leader of a major ally - the first to visit this year - who was showing them some love after months of what they see as growing Western indifference.  ""I come from the world's oldest parliament to address the world's bravest,"" Mr Sunak told them. For a man seen by some as a rational technocrat, he was clearly affected by the emotion. And for a prime minister behind in the polls, repeated standing ovations from any audience are not to be sniffed at.  Rishi Sunak has not suddenly become some global interventionist, seeking to reshape the world in Britain's interests. But nor too is he as unengaged in foreign affairs as some would have it. He may not be prime minister beyond an election later this year. But until then, there will be no shortage of foreign policy and the decisions he makes will matter. "

Hawkish,Protesters condemn 'short-sighted' hospital plans,2024-09-25,2024-01-24,By Brodie Owen & Kevin Hay,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-68085906,"Protesters have urged the NHS to reconsider ""short-sighted"" plans to close a community hospital and hand back wards at two others. NHS Devon has proposed closing Teignmouth Hospital and offloading vacant space at Seaton Hospital and Okehampton Hospital to save money. Ahead of a Devon County Council meeting on the issue, protesters described the plans as ""wrong"". NHS Devon said in a report it faced a £42m budget deficit in 2023-24. The BBC has contacted the trust for further comment. The council's Health and Adult Care Scrutiny Committee voted not to pressure the secretary of state for health over the planned closure of Teignmouth Hospital. However, the committee asked for another report into the Seaton plans, while no decision was made about Okehampton. Councillor Chris Clarance, Teignbridge District Council chairman, said he was disappointed by the decision not to refer the matter to the health secretary. ""It was terrible,"" he said. ""It was not what I was expecting... I was hoping the committee would stick with the original task group's finding to refer only for them to U-turn."" Viv Wilson, a campaigner, said Teignmouth Hospital was an ""essential"" part of the community. She argued NHS plans for a new health and wellbeing centre in the town would not meet demand. ""The decision to close Teignmouth Hospital is wrong,"" she said. ""The hospital is an essential part of the health and wellbeing of that particular part of Devon - their proposal to spend £23m on a health hub, which is not a hospital, just really won't fit the bill."" Martin Shaw, from Seaton Hospital Steering Committee, said NHS Devon's plans to hand back a two-storey wing to its property service was ""short-sighted"". ""Cuts don't have to be made in this way,"" he said. ""It matters to me because I live in a small town which is a long way from the acute hospital."" Jan Goffey, a former mayor of Okehampton, said similar plans to hand back an empty ward would cost the community ""far more"" than the NHS would save. ""Elderly patients don't heal as well if they are far away from their family and friends,"" she added. In a report presented to councillors, NHS Devon said it faced ""severe financial challenges"". ""In 2023/24... the forecast deficit for the county's NHS system as a whole is £42.3m, which includes a £212m savings plan,"" it said. ""We are £32.5m adrift from where we expected to be against our plan."" Follow BBC Devon on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram. Send your story ideas to spotlight@bbc.co.uk."
Hawkish,EU clubs together on energy and invites UK,2024-09-25,2022-09-08,By Katya Adler,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-62822368,"""Gasmageddon"" is bearing down on Europe this winter.  It may sound like the stuff of nightmares. But this is no science fiction. The number of households facing energy poverty has doubled across the EU, according to financial services provider Allianz.  Gas shortages could drive up retail prices by 200%. Three-quarters of companies in the bloc's economic powerhouse, Germany, say they're experiencing ""severe strain"" from spiralling energy prices. In the UK, energy bills have gone up 80%. The word ""recession"" is whispered everywhere.  Vladimir Putin is not only using conventional military weapons in Ukraine, he is also weaponising energy to try to intimidate the West, as he seeks to readjust the balance of power in Europe to Russia's favour.  On Wednesday, he railed: ""We will not supply anything at all if it is contrary to our interests. No gas, no oil, no coal, no fuel oil, nothing."" Squeezing the EU had looked to the Kremlin like a piece of cake. The bloc relied on Russia for 40% of its gas and a third of its oil before Mr Putin invaded Ukraine. Big EU powers Germany and Italy were even more dependent. The Russian president has been switching gas supplies on and off at whim for months and the colder months are fast approaching. Even countries traditionally less reliant on Russian energy, such as France, Spain and non-EU UK, are affected by the volatility and price hikes on the global energy markets.  With businesses threatened with bankruptcy and vulnerable voters facing a choice of paying for food or fuel this winter, political and social tensions have soared alongside prices. Prague saw mass demonstrations last weekend, with angry crowds protesting against the cost of living crisis and demanding an end to sanctions against Russia.  Bear in mind that the Czech Republic has, till now, always been hawkish towards Russia and outspoken about the need to defend Ukraine. But the economic pain at home is biting hard. As they did at the start of the Covid crisis, EU countries tried to find their own, national, solutions.  Spain slapped limits on air conditioning in public buildings and Germany tried to discourage people from using their cars by reducing fares on public transport, while in Italy, a Nobel prize-winning physicist sparked a furious cultural debate, suggesting people could cook pasta with the heat off to save energy and cost.  A number of member states have hastily assembled financial packages to help struggling households and/or businesses. Their aim: both to reduce energy consumption and to keep costs down for consumers.  German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has become fond of peppering his (German-language) news conference with the English words of the song You'll Never Walk Alone, popularised by Gerry and the Pacemakers.   But the focus now is on finding a European solution. And not a few EU figures, French President Emmanuel Macron included, have said they'd love the UK to be part of a plan. More on that later. The drive for the common EU approach is manifold. In part, it comes from the same post-Covid crisis realisation that as part of a single market, when the economies of some member states suffer, it pulls everyone down.  There's also an appreciation that there's strength in numbers. Countries such as Italy and Germany have been busy trying to find alternative energy suppliers - in Algeria and the UAE, for example. But if the EU as a whole, with its economic clout, makes the energy deal, the conditions are likely to be more favourable.  ""We have to achieve that we only pay the world market price, rather than a higher price,"" said Mr Scholz on Wednesday. His Belgian counterpart, Alexander De Croo, pointed out that gas prices in Europe are currently double those in Asia and 10 times as much as in the US. EU purchasing power would also avoid one member state trying to outbid another in their scramble for energy. Not a good look when it comes to EU unity. There is, too, a very sincere desire in the EU to stop pouring energy money into Russia's war chest. It's true, the majority of member states have drastically reduced their reliance on Russia by now. But as one very irritated EU diplomat pointed out to me, sky-high energy prices mean EU countries still pay almost the same daily amount of money to Moscow, although they currently receive so much less. ""Putin has to be roaring with laughter at us,"" he said.  EU energy ministers have been summoned to an emergency meeting in Brussels on Friday to discuss a raft of proposals to jointly combat the crisis.  ""Russia is manipulating our energy markets,"" tweeted EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen, ""[but] we have the economic strength, the political will and unity to keep the upper hand.""  EU countries have already reached agreements on reducing Russian oil imports and Russian gas reliance. The Commission established joint gas purchasing capabilities back in April and planned sufficient energy storage ahead of this winter.  Proposals for this Friday include: But EU leaders are far from united in their priorities or energy planning. Unanimous or immediate agreement is unlikely on Friday. Germany is still iffy about capping Russian gas prices, for example. Poland wants all extra-EU gas sources to have a price cap.  And there are other tricky issues such as if/when to decouple the gas and electricity markets (a similar debate rages in the UK) and how to ensure consumers understand the long-term need to change habits and consume less energy, even if governments intervene to keep prices lower. European Green parties are also extremely uneasy about the EU rush to replace Russian fossil fuel supplies with others elsewhere. The German Green Party is a senior government coalition partner. Its co-chair, Robert Habeck, is deputy prime minister and economics minister.  He's been travelling cap in hand to the United Arab Emirates, keen as keen for fossil fuel deals - an irony not lost on his opponents. German Green MEP Ska Keller admitted to me that yes, Green politicians had big plans, ""but then governing happens."" She insisted that polls in Germany indicate voters understand that the Greens are being ""responsible and pragmatic"" in a time of energy crisis, but that they haven't forgotten the climate emergency. European Commission energy spokesman, Tim McPhie, is quick to underline when that it comes to energy, there are ""short-term fixes and longer term fixes"". The EU Green Deal and climate goals are a huge source of pride in Brussels.  Mr McPhie says long-term European security is not about replacing Russian gas with gas from somewhere else - it's about renewables' energy efficiency.  And what about that invitation for UK co-operation on energy that I mentioned earlier, repeated to me again this week by the French Europe Minister, Laurence Boone? Her predecessor, Nathalie Loiseau, says that in these times of crisis, co-operation makes more sense than post-Brexit ""splendid isolation"". But while it could make economic sense for the UK to join together with the EU to try to benefit from lower prices on the global market, new PM Liz Truss, even if tempted, might find that co-operation politically awkward with some parts of her Conservative party. There is, though, an aspect of energy and the EU that Prime Minister Truss won't be able to ignore. And that's to do with Northern Ireland. The island of Ireland has a single electricity market, interconnected to Great Britain, says Mary Starks, former director at GB energy regulator Ofgem, now energy specialist at Flint. But the Republic of Ireland is an EU member state, theoretically subject to EU common energy regulations. ""So what this means for both Northern Ireland and the Republic will come into focus at some point,"" says Ms Starks. And if wholesale energy prices are successfully reduced on one side of the Channel, but not the other? Ms Starks told me that normally, energy flows very freely across electricity and gas interconnectors, but if the EU, for example, managed to lower prices before the UK, then Brussels would ""need to take steps to ensure its cheaper power and gas did not 'leak' to the UK"". While Ms Starks says it would be highly unlikely that the EU would shut the interconnectors unilaterally, there would have to be some sort of regulation of trading and flows, in order to prevent leakage. And that would necessitate dialogue. "
Hawkish,Germany under pressure to explain leaked phone call,2024-09-25,2024-03-04,By Jessica Parker and Laura Gozzi,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68467329,"Germany is scrambling to explain how an audio of air force officials apparently discussing giving Ukraine long-range missiles was leaked by Russian sources. Details of alleged British operations on the ground in Ukraine are also mentioned. Russia's state-run RT channel posted an audio recording of the meeting last week. The breach has sparked major concerns about Germany's security among allies, including France and the UK. Germany's defence ministry has confirmed that a conversation of air force officials was ""intercepted"" - but couldn't say whether the recording had been tampered with.  German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has repeatedly ruled out sending the Taurus missiles to Ukraine.  Nevertheless, in the recording four senior German military officers, including Air Force chief Ingo Gerhartz and Brig Gen Frank Gräfe, are seemingly heard discussing the prospect of supplying Ukraine with the long-range cruise missiles and saying the weapons could be used to hit the Kerch Bridge, which links Russia to the illegally-annexed peninsula of Crimea. Mr Gerhartz also mentions rumours that the Taurus system ""doesn't even work"".  He also suggests that German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius has been wondering ""what that would look like"" if Germany did eventually decide to provide the Taurus to Ukraine. The men also appear to discuss details of alleged British operations on the ground in Ukraine and imply that Britain has been sending personnel to help Ukrainians work the Storm Shadow missiles. The officers say that because of the complexity of the Taurus system, the Ukrainians would also need similar assistance and training from German staff.  On Monday, Chancellor Olaf Scholz said having German soldiers involved in such a task on Ukrainian soil was ""completely out of the question"". The officials discuss the logistical problems of hitting the Kerch Bridge and say the Ukrainians would need assistance with mission planning - which could also be seen as German involvement and a ""red line for the government"".  In another section of the leaked conversation, the officials say that the Taurus would not change the course of the war and that Germany would send no more than 100 missiles to Ukraine.  They add that the political momentum to send the Taurus could come from the fact that the British and French have pretty much run out of Storm Shadows and Scalp missiles. Tobias Ellwood, a UK member of parliament and former chairman of the Commons Defence Committee, told the BBC that the leak was ""worrying on a number of levels"". The discussion was reportedly hosted on the Webex conference platform rather than a secure army platform, causing further embarrassment for Berlin. Germany's Military Counterintelligence Service is investigating the security breach. But it is not clear whether the results of the investigation will be made public. Mr Scholz's allies have resisted calls from the opposition for a parliamentary inquiry. The episode has highlighted divisions over Mr Scholz's current insistence that he won't send Taurus missiles to Ukraine. Mr Scholz fears the missiles, which have a range of around 500km (300 miles), could be used by Ukraine to strike Russian territory. France and Britain have supplied Kyiv with Scalp and Storm Shadow missiles, both of which have around half the range. Mr Ellwood said the leak revealed a ""tension... between senior German military who want to see Taurus dispatched and the German Chancellor, who seems increasingly focused on his political survival rather than what's best for the continent."" German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius is attempting to portray the hack as an attempt by Russia to sow division. He called the leak a ""hybrid disinformation attack"" aimed at ""undermining our unity."" ""We mustn't fall for Putin,"" he said on Sunday. For its part, the Kremlin is framing the leak as proof that the West is directly involved in the conflict in Ukraine. Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Monday that the leaked conversation ""suggests that the Bundeswehr is discussing substantively and specifically plans to strike Russian territory."" Dmitry Medvedev, the hawkish former Russian president, said that Russia would ""not forget"" the leaked conversation.  ""The road of diplomacy is not yet closed, but they must understand what we did to them during [World War Two],"" he said. Additional reporting by Michael Ertl"
Hawkish,China sets ambitious economic target for 2024,2024-09-25,2024-03-05,By Peter Hoskins,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68271274,"China has set an ambitious growth target of around 5% for this year, as it outlined a series of measures aimed at boosting its flagging economy. Premier Li Qiang made the announcement at the opening of the annual National People's Congress (NPC) on Tuesday. Mr Li acknowledged that China's economic performance had faced ""difficulties"", adding that many of these had ""yet to be resolved"".  It comes as China struggles to reinvigorate its once-booming economy. ""Risks and potential dangers in real estate, local government debt, and small and medium financial institutions were acute in some areas,"" he said. ""Under these circumstances, we faced considerably more dilemmas in making policy decisions and doing our work."" A series of other measures to help tackle the country's slow recovery from the pandemic were also announced, including the development of new initiatives to tackle problems in the country's crisis-hit property sector. Beijing also aims to add 12 million jobs in urban areas. Regulation of financial markets will also be increased, said Premier Li, while research will be stepped up in new technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI) and life sciences. Along with measures to boost the economy, defence spending will be increased by 7.2% this year. Beijing's defence budget is closely watched by its neighbours and the US, due to concerns over its intentions as tensions remain high over Taiwan. For decades the Chinese economy expanded at a stellar rate, with official figures putting its gross domestic product (GDP) growing at an average of close to 10% a year. On the way it overtook Japan to become the world's second largest economy, with Beijing claiming that it had lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. Beijing says that last year the economy grew by 5.2%, which even at that level is low for China. However, some critics argue the real figure could be less than a third of that. ""I think the next five or 10 years is going to be difficult,"" Andrew Collier Managing Director from China research firm Orient Capital Research told the BBC. ""A lot of economists think the numbers are completely fabricated. The idea of 5.2% or 5.5% growth is much likely wrong. It's more like 1% or 2%,"" he added. Whichever figures are accurate, it is clear that this vast country and its leaders face a daunting array of economic challenges. That list includes a property market in crisis, a shaky stock market, high youth unemployment and the threat of deflation as consumer prices continue to fall. Those immediate problems are compounded by longer term issues from trade and geopolitical tensions to China's falling birth rate and aging population. One of the most serious of these challenges are associated with the housing market, which according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) accounts for around 20% of the economy. It is a major problem ""not just for property developers but also the regional banks that are highly exposed to it,"" Dan Wang, chief economist of Hang Seng Bank (China), said. The real estate industry crisis was highlighted last week when the country's biggest private developer Country Garden was hit with a winding-up petition in Hong Kong by a creditor. It came just a month after debt-laden rival Evergrande was ordered to liquidate by a court in the city. And while much of the rest of the world has struggled with soaring prices in the wake of the pandemic, China was one of the few major economies to avoid high inflation. Now though it is having to deal with the opposite problem - persistently falling prices or deflation. Consumer prices in China fell in January at the fastest pace in almost 15 years, marking the fourth month in a row of declines. It was the sharpest drop since September 2009, when the world economy was still reeling from the effects of the global financial crisis. Deflation is bad for economies as it can mean that people keep putting off buying big ticket items, like washing machines or cars, on the expectation that they will be cheaper in the future. It also has an impact on people and businesses with debts. Prices and incomes may fall, but debts do not. For a company with falling revenue, or a household with a declining income, debt payments become more of a burden. All of this means China is lacking something vital to a strong economy: confidence. And authorities have been scrambling to reassure investors and consumers. ""Messaging from policymakers continues to be about restoring confidence and domestic demand,"" Catherine Yeung from Fidelity International told the BBC. So far that has meant a series of relatively small measures targeting different parts of the economy. This year alone, borrowing costs have been cut and direct support offered to developers along with other actions to tackle the property crisis. Earlier this month, in a shock move, the head of China's stock market regulator was replaced, in what was seen as a signal that the government was ready to take forceful measures to end the rout in its $8 trillion stock market. Officials have also moved to clamp down on traders betting against shares in Chinese companies, and imposed new rules on selling shares at the start and end of the trading day. Beyond these immediate issues China also faces a number of more far-reaching challenges, including slowing productivity growth and an aging population. ""The demographic dynamics are quite unfavourable, with the population aging fast due to the one-child policy,"" Qian Wang, chief Asia-Pacific economist at investment firm Vanguard said. ""Unlike Japan that got rich before it got old, China is getting old before it gets rich,"" she added. There is also the seemingly intractable geopolitical issue of Taiwan. Beijing sees self-ruled Taiwan as a breakaway province that will eventually be part of China, and has not ruled out the use of force to achieve this. But Taiwan sees itself as distinct from the Chinese mainland. Taiwan is a key flashpoint in the tussle between China and the US for supremacy in Asia.  This, at the very least, greatly complicates China's relations with the US and many other major Western economies. There is also the ongoing trade dispute with the US, which started in 2018 under then-president Donald Trump and has shown no sign of easing during the Biden administration. A potential second term in office for Mr Trump could well see tensions ramp up between Washington and Beijing. Mr Trump, in characteristically hawkish comments about China, said he would impose more tariffs on its goods if he wins the US presidential election in November. In an interview with Fox News, he said the tariffs could be in excess of 60%: ""We have to do it,"" he said. While that may make for plenty of headlines, Ms Yeung suggests financial markets may be able to take this in their stride. ""Most of this negative news has already been factored in to share valuations,"" she said. Whether Mr Xi's long-term plans for China will turn around his country's fortunes remains to be seen.  What is clear though is that its more than 1.4 billion people are unlikely to enjoy a return to double digit annual growth, and the prosperity that comes with it, anytime soon."
Hawkish,The young Republican who gave rebuttal speech,2024-09-25,2024-03-07,By Matt Murphy,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68484784,"Alabama's Katie Britt, the youngest woman representing the Republicans in the US Senate, has given her party's response to President Joe Biden's third State of the Union address.  Sitting at her kitchen table, she accused the president of being out of touch and painted a dark picture of the US under his watch. ""Right now, the American Dream has turned into a nightmare for so many families,"" she said. The rebuttal - first delivered in 1966 - is often given by rising stars in the opposition party.  Ms Britt, 42, echoed popular Republican attack lines in her 17-minute speech, hitting Mr Biden hard on the border crisis and inflation. Reactions to her performance were mixed. Conservative media outlet Fox News reviewed the speech as a successful effort which ""pulled-no-punches"" when ""shredding"" the president's national address. But some criticism focussed on her performative delivery. Others took issue with the unconventional setting - her kitchen table in Montgomery - for a speech meant to counter presidential remarks delivered from the Capitol.  Alyssa Farah Griffin, a former Trump White House communications adviser, posted on X: ""I do not understand the decision to put her in a KITCHEN for one of the most important speeches she's ever given."" Ahead of the speech, some political commentators had suggested Ms Britt was an astute choice to deliver the Republican response.   She has avoided isolationist tendencies in her party and emerged as a hawkish figure on national security. And her speech largely avoided the kind of combative politics championed by some in the party.  Now in her second year in the Senate, Ms Britt first arrived in Washington in 2004 as a congressional staffer. Having earned a law degree at the University of Alabama, she served variously as press secretary, communications director and chief of staff to Alabama Senator Richard Shelby.  In 2018, she was elected as the first woman to lead her state's business council, where she became associated with the Keep Alabama Open campaign during the Covid-19 pandemic. The role elevated her profile within the state, and her resignation in 2021 prompted speculation - proven correct - about her intention to seek the Senate seat of her outgoing mentor, Sen Shelly.  She was elected in 2022 after easily seeing off her main opponent for the Republican nomination, Mo Brooks - a state representative at the time and a long-time adversary of Mr Trump's - before sweeping away her Democratic rival in the general election.  Since her arrival in Washington DC, Ms Britt has taken a position on the powerful Senate appropriations committee and worked as a key fundraiser for more senior colleagues.  Among Democrats, she has won some approval by working on a bipartisan bill prohibiting children under 13 from using social media and visiting John Fetterman when the Pennsylvania senator checked into hospital to seek treatment for depression.  Thursday's speech has elevated her profile to the national stage and it won the approval of Donald Trump. ""She was compassionate and caring, especially concerning Women and Women's Issues. Her conversation on Migrant Crime was powerful and insightful. Great job Katie!"" he wrote on Truth Social, his own social media platform. Some saw her speech as an audition for a spot on Mr Trump's list of candidates for the vice-presidency. But she and the former president are not natural allies.  She was the last member of Alabama's congressional delegation to endorse the 77-year-old in December, and observers note that her political views have been more temperate than Mr Trump's.  In an interview with Politico last year, Ms Britt criticised - obliquely - Mr Trump's penchant for personalised attacks on his political opponents.  ""I really believe we have to get back to a place in this nation where you don't have to agree with someone 100% to show them respect and to be able to have a conversation and dialogue that you can learn from,"" she said.  Indeed, the Alabama native has been more closely aligned with outgoing Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell, joining his leadership group as an informal adviser last year.  Mr McConnell - a veteran dealmaker in the chamber - has long been at odds with Mr Trump and his brand of politics, although he endorsed the former president this week.  Ms Britt has also become known for her hawkish views on national security, at times running up against colleagues in a party increasingly defined by American isolationism.  Nonetheless, she has remained in favour with senior members of the Senate leadership and those within Mr Trump's orbit, a difficult feat. "
Hawkish,'Final roll of dice' in bid to stop hospital closure,2024-09-25,2024-03-02,By Guy Henderson,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-68456947,"A battle to save a hospital from closure has reached ""the final roll of the dice"", a councillor has said. NHS Devon has decided to relocate services from the hospital to a proposed new health and wellbeing hub in the town centre, and Dawlish Community Hospital.  That would leave the hospital empty and facing the prospect of closure.  However, campaigners said the hospital's role remained vital. Chair of Teignbridge District Council, Councillor Chris Clarance, said the authority needed to ""act quickly"". It was the first NHS hospital to be built after World War Two, replacing a building which was bombed. NHS Devon Clinical Commissioning Group decided in December 2020 to move its services to other locations in Teignmouth and Dawlish.  Any future decision about what to do with the hospital itself would rest with owners Torbay and South Devon NHS Foundation Trust, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. In January, Devon County Council committee voted not to lobby the minister on behalf of Teignmouth. Mr Clarance said: ""The NHS says its model of care is working efficiently. If it was, there wouldn't be queues of ambulances lined up on a daily basis outside Torquay's accident and emergency department. ""If any lay person can see that there are insufficient in-patient beds, why can't our trust see it too?"" Mr Clarance, who is an Independent representing Shaldon and Stokeinteignhead, disputed reports which claimed the fabric of the building was in poor condition. ""I don't buy into the argument that it is all doom and gloom about the state of the building,"" he said. ""We can't afford to wait any longer. This is the final roll of the dice."" Liberal Democrat councillor Rosie Dawson, who represents north east Dawlish, said the hospital had been used as a ""red zone"" assessment centre during the pandemic, and may be needed again. ""If this is the last action we can take to try and save Teignmouth Hospital then we must take it,"" she said. Councillor Joan Atkins, Conservative councillor for Teignmouth Central, said: ""I believe firmly that primary care should be available, but I don't believe the hospital is the place for it to be. I think we're barking up the wrong tree."" Follow BBC Devon on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram. Send your story ideas to spotlight@bbc.co.uk."
Hawkish,Major rail upgrade to bring widespread disruption,2024-09-25,2024-02-29,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-cornwall-68431773,"Rail passengers in Devon and Cornwall are being warned of widespread disruption on the network due to a major signalling upgrade. Network Rail said a ""once-in-a-generation"" engineering project would see 66 miles (106km) of track between Plymouth and St Erth upgraded with digital signalling. Thirteen days of work in Cornwall are expected to be completed by 10 March. Work then resumes near Plymouth from 16 to 21 March. No trains are running between St Austell and St Erth, and Truro and Falmouth Docks, until Sunday. Further work between 4 and 8 March will see no trains between Liskeard and St Erth. There will also be no trains between Plymouth and St Erth on the weekend of 9 and 10 March. Martin Duff, from Network Rail, said three traditional signal boxes would close as part of the work, with signalling to be controlled centrally at Exeter. New track, sleepers and ballasts are also being laid as part of the upgrade.   Mr Duff said: ""It's both a very big project and a very challenging project. ""We're signalling the railway - [it is] a once in a generation alteration between Liskeard and Chacewater."" Matt Barnes, from Great Western Railway (GWR), said the new system meant services would be more reliable. ""The signalling in this area is Victorian in type,"" he said. ""So having a new digital signalling system, a modern signalling system, is going to be a great thing for customers and our ability to run train services reliably."" The firm said rail replacement would be in operation on the affected routes. The new signals in Cornwall are due to come into use on Monday 11 March, with Devon following on Friday 22 March. Passengers were advised to check the GWR website before travelling. Follow BBC Cornwall on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

Hawkish,Bar owner 'loses everything' as Storm Babet hits,2024-09-25,2023-10-18,Brodie Owen,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn0d2z0j4vvo,"A business owner in Devon has said he has ""lost everything"" after his beach bar was swept into the sea during Storm Babet. The Soak beach bar on Torquay seafront was destroyed during high tide. Co-owner Sean White said: ""We’re devastated... we've lost everything."" There was also major damage to a number of beach huts in Paignton and Teignmouth. Mr White said the storm surge and accumulation of water ""caught us off guard"". He said he checked on the business on Tuesday night, but it was too late. ""Two hours before the high tide happened, the water was coming over the wall,"" he said. ""Annoyingly, we’ve just recovered from the loss of another business - we’ve just picked ourselves up... and now it’s gone."" Severe weather also also caused disruption for road and rail commuters. Train operator Great Western Railway said severe weather along the Dawlish coastal route meant trains between Exeter St Davids and Newton Abbot could be cancelled, delayed or revised. National Rail said severe weather and a broken down train meant lines between Exeter St Davids and Paignton and Plymouth may be disrupted. Devon County Council said flooding meant Withycombe Village Road in  Exmouth was closed. National Highways said the A303, between the A358 at Horton Cross and the A30 at Upottery, had reopened in both directions after an earlier crash. Tor Bay Harbour Authority said on Facebook it was aware of damage to beach huts in the area. It said a clean-up operation would begin when the weather improved. Sam Williams, who owns a hut at Goodrington North, Paignton, said at least one beach hut had completely washed away. ""It's carnage - there's just wood everywhere,"" he said. ""There's going to be a lot of sad beach hut owners at the moment."" Torbay Beach Hut User Group said: “The photos say it all, beach huts bring communities together, a happy place for all ages so much positivity is good for our wellness of hut users.  ""It is a very sad day to see so much damage but we are glad no-one has been injured.” Beach huts were also destroyed in Teignmouth.  A seaside skate park in the town also appeared to be full of water. Amy Scott, from the Livermead House Hotel in Torquay, said the seafront was ""wild and windy"". ""Everywhere is wet, it’s absolutely flooded, the waves are huge at the moment,"" she said. ""I've seen a very few brave joggers... [but] it's at a standstill, nothing is really moving."" Torbay Council warned that high tides were expected during the morning rush-hour over the next few days, ""so there is always the potential for the seafront road to be closed"". It said staff had been moving beach huts into storage since 2 October and the operation usually took about four weeks. But ""due to previous bad weather conditions, we have not been able to move them all yet"" and ""unfortunately, we are aware that there has been damage to several beach huts"". Access to Roundham promenade had been closed ""due to the number of huts in a precarious state"", said a council spokesperson. ""As soon as it is safe for a full assessment, we will update you further and contact customers individually,"" they added. Storm Babet, a complex area of low pressure which developed to the west of the Iberian Peninsula, was named by the Met Office on Monday. People in others parts of the UK and Ireland are also being warned about the extreme rain and wind. David Braine, Senior Meteorologist, BBC South West, said ""some sizeable waves were whipped up by the easterly winds - an unusual direction for us to see such strong winds"". He added no weather warnings were in force for the region, with most warnings in northern Britain. Follow BBC News South West on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

Hawkish,Rail body wants staff to be 'amateur meteorologists',2024-09-25,2024-04-03,By Tom Espiner,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68721690,"Network Rail is aiming to turn hundreds of staff into ""amateur meteorologists"" as part of plans to deal with the effects of climate change. It wants to help staff to interpret weather forecasts to make better decisions during storms or heatwaves. The public rail body said it will spend £2.8bn over the next five years on efforts to cope with extreme weather. Its boss Andrew Haines said climate change was ""the biggest challenge our railway faces"". ""The extreme weather of the past year that has seen an unprecedented 14 named storms, has taken its toll on our railway - with experts predicting more of the same to come,"" he said. As the Earth's climate changes due to global warming, weather events such as heatwaves and storms are set to become more intense, and flooding more severe. It has led to Network Rail, which owns and maintains the railways, ""relentlessly"" having to rebuild embankments and cuttings due to more landslips caused by heavier rain in a way that its predecessor British Rail never had to, a spokesman said. The body said: ""Hundreds of key operational staff will attend Network Rail's new 'weather academy' to help make them 'amateur meteorologists'"". Workers will be trained at the academy, which is a collaboration between Newcastle University, the Met Office, and MetDesk, a private weather forecasting firm. A spokesman for the body added: ""By training with actual meteorologists, our people will be better placed to make positive decisions when there is extreme weather, from speed restrictions to - in extreme circumstances - closing lines."" The controllers will not get a qualification, and their training will not replace the detailed forecasts Network Rail currently uses, but it will help them ""become more informed and well-rounded decision makers"", the spokesman said. As well as weather training, Network Rail said it planned to increase and make drainage on rail lines more resilient. It is also aiming to recruit 400 more drainage engineers, strengthen cuttings and embankments, and install sensors to monitor movement and CCTV at flood sites. It said deploying new technology would allow trains to run at higher speeds during stormy weather. Inadequate drainage and heavy rain can cause serious or even fatal incidents on the railways. In 2020, a train derailed at Carmont in Aberdeenshire after hitting debris that had washed out of an improperly installed drainage ditch, killing three people and injuring six. Network Rail admitted to a series of failings and criminal charges in September 2023. But while Network Rail has announced its £45.4bn plan to mitigate the impact of climate change over the next five years, the amount is a cut in real terms of £200m compared with the previous period. With funding being tighter, Network Rail said it would focus investment on ""the parts of the railway that affect the most people and the aspects that protect safety"". It also plans to make cost savings of £3.9bn. However, Bruce Williamson from campaign group Railfuture said passengers wanted a ""reliable railway"", which would only happen from ""regular, long-term investment to a high standard"".  Fewer than two thirds of trains in the UK were on time between October and December 2023, and roughly 5% of trains were cancelled. This was for various reasons, including faults attributed to Network Rail, and faults by train operators."
Hawkish,How might Iran seek to hurt Israel after general's killing?,2024-09-25,2024-04-04,By Baran Abbasi,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68724691,"Iran has vowed to respond to Monday's air strike on its consulate in Damascus - but what capacity does Iran have to hurt Israel and what form might retaliation take? Thirteen people were killed including Brigadier General Mohammad Reza Zahedi, an important figure in the Quds force, the overseas branch of Iran's elite Republican Guards. Israel has not said whether it was behind the attack. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had ""completely lost his mental balance"", Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian was quoted as saying on his ministry's website.  The escalation was designed to show the world that Iran was a ""paper tiger"", said Fawaz Gerges, professor of International Relations at London School of Economics. It also represented a significant loss to the Quds force, ""which is really for coordination and arms and technology transfers to Hezbollah in Lebanon and Syria"". Hamas's military wing, the Qassam brigades, has said Brig Gen Zahedi had a ""prominent role"" in the 7 October Hamas attacks on southern Israel, which sparked the current war in Gaza that is threatening to spread. Iran has denied a role in the attack itself but backs Hamas with funding, weapons and training. However Iran's options for retaliation for the Damascus strike may be limited in scope and number, Mr Gerges and other experts told the BBC.  ""Iran is not capable of a big confrontation with Israel given its military capabilities and economic and political situation,"" said Ali Sadrzadeh an author and analyst of Middle East affairs. ""But it will have to come up with a response for domestic consumption and to protect its reputation among its regional allies."" Mr Gerges also said Iran was unlikely to retaliate directly against Israel, ""even though Israel really humiliated Iran and bloodied Iran's nose"". Instead Iran was likely to exercise ""strategic patience"" because it will prioritise a more important goal: making a nuclear bomb. ""[Iran is] accumulating power, it's enriching uranium, it's making progress. And the big prize for Iran is not really to send 50 ballistic missiles and kill 100 Israelis, but to establish strategic deterrence, not only against the Israelis, but even against the US state."" Since Israel's war in Gaza, missile and drone attacks by Iran-backed militia in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon and Yemen against Israel interests have escalated but they seem to have limited their actions short of provoking Israel into a full-scale war.  ""Even an attack against an Israeli diplomatic mission by Iran's proxy forces seems difficult to imagine,"" said Mr Sadrzadeh, although he did predict that current attacks by Iran-backed Houthi militia against ships in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden are ""very likely to continue, especially against vessels that are somehow linked to Israel or the US"".  Hezbollah is one of the most heavily armed, non-state military forces in the world - independent estimates suggest the group has between 20,000 and 50,000 fighters, and many are well-trained and battle-hardened through their participation in the Syrian civil war. The Iran-backed Lebanese group has an arsenal of an estimated 130,000 rockets and missiles, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies think-tank. Yet the experts the BBC spoke to thought it unlikely that the group would launch a major escalation against Israel. ""Hezbollah does not really want to fall into Israel's trap because they realise Benjamin Netanyahu and his war cabinet are desperately trying to expand the war,"" said Mr Gerges. ""The political future of Benjamin Netanyahu depends on the continuation of the war in Gaza and its escalation into northern fronts with Hezbollah and even with Iran itself."" Mr Sadrzadeh believes Iran is likely to show a ""symbolic"" reaction rather than risking a direct war with Israel. ""Iran is an expert in carrying out symbolic attacks like the one in response to the killing of its most important military commander Qasem Soleimani,"" Sadrzadeh said, referring to a ballistic missile attack by Iran against an Iraqi air base where US troops were stationed - a week after the US assassinated the Iranian general in Baghdad. Despite Iran's promise of ""severe revenge"", no US military personnel stationed at the base were killed, and there were reports that the US military had been warned in advance of the incoming missiles.  Yousof Azizi at Virginia Tech's School of Public & International Affairs believes that there will be a struggle going on behind the scenes in Iran between those who argue that Iran should seek to establish itself as a nuclear power to deter Israeli aggression and more hawkish figures who suggest direct attacks on Israel and its military installations. But he told the BBC that an analysis of state media interviews and key social media accounts suggested the policy of ""strategic patience"" was likely to prevail. So what other avenues are open to the Iranians? ""We cannot rule out that perhaps Iran may use cyberspace as another dimension to take revenge on Israel, either to perform cyber-attacks on information technology, and to cripple, and to steal, and to leak information, or to try to distract at least operational technology,"" Tal Pavel of the Israeli Institute for Cyber Policy Studies told the BBC. ""We know that during the past decade and a half, there is an ongoing clandestine cyber war between Iran and Israel. So in this case, it may be just another stage,"" he said. It will be up to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to decide what action Tehran ultimately takes."
Hawkish,Minor injuries unit reopens at Devon hospital ,2024-09-25,2024-04-04,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c994zy5rpvxo,"A minor injuries unit has reopened at a Devon hospital after it was closed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Bosses at Dawlish Community Hospital's minor injuries unit said it had an ""appointment-priority"" service in place to deliver a ""consistent service"".  They said people would be able to call and book appointments for the same day.  The minor injuries unit is open Monday to Friday between 08:00 and 17:00. Sarah James, matron of the unit, said: ""The booking system is designed so that we can actually offer a consistent service again. ""We do not want people to turn up and find we are overwhelmed and therefore not able to see everybody that turns up."" Ms James added the service would allow the team to plan their workload and ensure they accommodated everyone who visited the unit. The unit said it would also support walk-in visitors but appointments would be prioritised so people may be redirected.  Chief executive at Torbay and South Devon NHS Foundation Trust, Liz Davenport, said: ""Our teams have worked hard over a long period of time to reach this point.  ""We know how much the service means to local people and we would like to apologise once again for the long temporary closure,"" said Ms Davenport. She added they received ""positive feedback"" from the ""appointment-priority"" at the unit at Totnes Community Hospital.  The Dawlish unit said it originally closed as part of Torbay and South Devon NHS Foundation Trust’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic due to staffing levels and demand for services.

Hawkish,Rwanda defeat in Lords and 'rate cut hope',2024-09-25,2024-03-20,By BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-the-papers-68622535,"The Times suggests the latest series of Lords defeats on the government's Rwanda Bill may mean no flights taking off until June at the earliest.  The paper says that even once the legislation receives Royal Assent it could still take the Home Office up to 10 weeks to resolve various logistical and legal issues. Ministers hope to stage two consecutive days of votes in both houses on the issue after Easter to push it through. The Daily Telegraph reports Catherine, the Princess of Wales, has been easing back into normal life after her abdominal surgery by working from home on her project to improve the lives of very young children. The paper says Kensington Palace has confirmed the princess has been kept up to date with her early years campaign. Michael Saunders, a former member of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee - which sets interest rates - tells the i newspaper he thinks falling inflation will mean three rate cuts this year, which the paper says will come as a relief to mortgage holders.  The Daily Mail reports that some economists think there could be as many as five. Inside, it urges Bank of England economists to be ""bold"" and start cutting interest rates immediately when they meet on Thursday. The Daily Telegraph says the Work and Pensions Secretary has warned Britain's approach to mental health is in danger of having ""gone too far"". Mel Stride says too many people are self-diagnosing and the problem is pushing up the benefits bill.  He was speaking as he revealed plans to make 150,000 people signed off with mild conditions look for a job - though the scheme is not due to come into force until after the next general election. The Daily Express reports that Rishi Sunak will put a commitment to the pension triple lock at the heart of the Conservatives' election manifesto. Campaigners tell the paper it would help win the support of millions of older voters.  The paper says the future of the guarantee has come under ""scrutiny"" after the Chancellor Jeremy Hunt told peers the pension safeguard and pension age were always under review.  The Daily Mirror in an editorial headlined ""Hunt Raids OAP Cash"" accuses the chancellor of being ""oblivious"" to the concern and uncertainty he caused with his comments and it welcomes Rishi Sunak's commitment. According to the Financial Times, a gene therapy to treat a very rare disease which attacks the central nervous system of children has become the most expensive drug in the world.

Hawkish,Pools get funding to help with energy costs,2024-09-25,2024-03-23,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-68639497,"Twenty swimming pools across Devon, Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly are to receive a share of a £60m cash grant. The funding, split between 325 pools in England, has come from the government and Sport England. It aims to secure the long-term future of the pools by improving energy efficiency and cutting running costs. Pools to benefit include Exe Valley Leisure Centre in Tiverton (£375,000), Dawlish Leisure Centre (£168,000) and St Ives Leisure Centre (£156,000). Also on the list is Ashburton swimming pool. The facility has been awarded £20,000, just weeks after it was saved from closure by community funding. Measures being supported by the Swimming Pool Support Fund include funding for new heating systems, solar panels and better insulation. Sports Minister Stuart Andrew said: ""Millions of people swim every year in England, but increased energy costs mean some pools are struggling financially. ""This further £60m of support from the government and Sport England will ensure hundreds of swimming pools can lower their operating costs in the long run, and continue to provide an important service for communities across the country.""

Hawkish,Care home's fears over overseas worker family ban,2024-09-25,2023-12-10,Miles Davis,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c843zwe5vp4o,"A care home boss has said a government announcement this week that aims to reduce legal migration would make it harder to find and keep staff. The government announced on Tuesday it plans to stop overseas care workers from bringing their families with them to the UK. Gabriela Ogreanu, from Sefton Hall care home in Dawlish, Devon, said foreign workers were far less likely to come to the UK without being able to bring their families. Home Secretary James Cleverly claimed the package of plans would mean 300,000 people who were eligible to come to the UK last year would not be able to in future. Ms Ogreanu runs the 50-bed care home for people over 65, which is full with a waiting list. She said it was very difficult to recruit care staff locally and overseas staff were essential to keep the home running. She said: ""I can only praise them to be honest, that's why I'm so disappointed because I think even for them, hearing the government decision makes them feel unwelcome. ""They will not come over here without their families."" Jini Joas, a qualified nurse, moved to the UK from India with her husband and daughter to work as a senior carer at Sefton Hall. She said: ""I came here for my family and this rule will affect everybody. ""All of the nurses are married and without their families they will not stay here."" Anne Blackham, who has a relative at the care home, said she was worried about the impact of the new immigration plans. She said: ""My biggest fear is that more care homes will have to close their doors. ""I searched high and low for the right place and it's only because of the foreign employees they have got that they can run."" The Home Office said the package of measures announced on Tuesday would ""end the high numbers of dependants coming to the UK"". It said: ""In the year ending September 2023, 101,000 Health and Care Worker visas were issued to care workers and senior care workers, with an estimated 120,000 visas granted to associated dependants, the majority of whom we estimate don’t work, but still make use of public services.""

Hawkish,Why US politicians are on a pilgrimage to Taiwan,2024-09-25,2024-02-22,By Rupert Wingfield-Hayes,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-68346855,"""How would you like it if we started sending official delegations to Honolulu to meet with separatist leaders who want Hawaiian independence from the United States? What would you do if we started selling them weapons?""   It might seem like a false equivalence, but this is a line of argument often deployed by China's legion of armchair warriors, who take to social media to condemn any visit to Taiwan by US government officials - and especially members of the US Congress. China sees self-ruled Taiwan as a breakaway province that will eventually be under Beijing's control, and so, to these social media users, such visits are an unacceptable provocation and interference in China's internal affairs. Of course, these visits  - like the one being made by Representative Mike Gallagher, head of the US House's China committee, this week - are viewed very differently in Washington and Taipei, which sees itself as distinct from the Chinese mainland, with its own constitution and democratically-elected leaders.  But it does raise the question, what is their purpose? Are they a genuine show of support that helps deter China - or are they publicity stunts that serve to provoke Beijing, and solidify the view that Washington is intent on the permanent separation of Taiwan?   The visits are not without consequence. How the US handles its relationships with Beijing and Taipei will do much to determine whether the current tense stalemate across the Taiwan Straits remains that way, or gets a lot worse.  ""We have come here to reaffirm US support for Taiwan and express solidarity in our shared commitment to democratic values,"" said Congressman Ami Bera and Mario Díaz Balart as they wound up a trip here in January. They were the first to make the pilgrimage to Taipei following the 13 January presidential election.  Now, the hawkish Rep Gallagher - who told the Guardian last year Beijing was aiming  ""to render us subordinate, humiliated and irrelevant on the world stage""  - arrives with a number of colleagues a month later. It is likely they will not be the last. Since 2016, the number of US congressional delegations crossing the Pacific has increased dramatically. In 2018, for example, six lawmakers made the trip. Last year, 32 visited, according to a tally by Global Taiwan. That trend has been actively encouraged by Taiwan's current President Tsai Ing-wen, and does not appear to have been discouraged on the US side. Indeed, President Joe Biden has been the most explicit of any US leader yet in his defence of Taiwan - albeit while still continuing a commitment to America's One China policy. ""It's important,"" says J Michael Cole, a former Canadian intelligence officer and one-time advisor to President Tsai. ""The United States keeps saying we have a rock-solid commitment to Taiwan. But you need a public component to that exercise. That's what rattles Beijing, that's what gets journalists writing about it.""  And unlike the $80m (£63m) grant signed off by Biden in November, these visits also represent a low-cost way for the US to re-assure the people of Taiwan that they do mean what they say. ""We have research that shows high-level visits increase people's confidence in the US-Taiwan relationship,"" says Chen Fang-yu, a political scientist at Soochow University in Taipei.   Such visits promote a more friendly attitude towards America from those who remain sceptical of whether the US would actually turn up if Taiwan were attacked by China, he explains. However, there are others here who have imbibed conspiracy theories, many of which originate from across the Taiwan Strait, that America is pushing Taipei down the road to war with China, just as conspiracy theorists say it did with Ukraine's war with Russia.  Meanwhile, American congressmen and women have their own, not always selfless, reasons for coming here. The pilgrimage to Taipei is increasingly a way for those on the right to burnish their anti-China credentials to voters back home - although these days, the left appears just as keen to prove their own tough stances when it comes to Beijing.  The increased frequency, and unabashed publicity, shows how much has changed between Washington and Beijing. ""Before 2016, people thought visits here should be low key,"" says Chen Fang-Yu. ""They wanted to avoid angering China. But now more and more people realise that no matter what they do, they will anger China."" Taiwan's relationship with the US Congress is deep and long. When in 1979, President Jimmy Carter broke relations with Taipei, and recognised Beijing, it was the US Congress that forced him to sign the Taiwan Relations Act. That act is what underpins the relationship with Taipei to this day. It explicitly commits the US to opposing any attempt to change the status quo across the Taiwan Strait by force, and to supplying Taiwan with sufficient weaponry to defend itself against China.  In the 1970s, Taiwan was a military dictatorship. Its US allies were Republican. The cold war was still very chilly, and the islands were seen as a bulwark against Communism. Today, anti-communism may still play a small part. But far more important is solidarity with a fellow democracy.  Taiwan is no longer a Republican Party cause. In the wake of things like Trump's trade wars, arguments over Covid's origins and spy balloons being spotted in the US, support for Taiwan among Americans now spreads through both parties.  Added to this, the US also has major national security and economic interests tied to Taiwan - in particular, the semiconductor trade. It all means that, unlike with Ukraine, there a no voices in Congress calling for the US to cut military support for Taiwan. If anything, it is the opposite.  But that question remains. Do the visits do more harm than good? When Nancy Pelosi came here in the summer of 2022, Beijing responded by firing ballistic missiles over the top of the island for the first time, including over the capital Taipei. Opinion polls taken after the visit showed a majority here thought the visit had damaged Taiwan's security.  It is quite common these days to hear those who specialise in Taiwan studies quoting the old maxim from President Theodore Roosevelt to ""speak softly and carry a big stick"".  J Michael Cole says that is exactly what the US and Taiwan are doing. He says the US congressional visits might be symbolic, but they are good PR for Taipei and for the members of Congress. With the exception of the Pelosi visit, they also fall below the threshold of what really upsets Beijing.  But, says J Michael Cole, what do these visits really mean for US-Taiwan relations? After all, ""the really substantive aspect … such as the increasingly high-level exchanges on things like intelligence, like defence, those don't make the news"".  ""Those are constructive,"" he continues. ""And the United States is adamant that those shall not be publicised by Taiwanese government."""
Hawkish,Trump 'playing with fire' on Taiwan,2024-09-25,2017-01-16,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-38633257,"China has been angered by Mr Trump's comments on the One China policy concerning Taiwan A Chinese state-owned paper has blasted Donald Trump for ""playing with fire"" after the US president-elect appeared to question the One China policy again. The broadside by China Daily is the latest in a series of rebukes by China's government and state media. Mr Trump said in an interview on Friday that the policy was negotiable. Under the longstanding policy, the US recognises Beijing as the only Chinese government, while maintaining an unofficial relationship with Taiwan. China sees Taiwan as a breakaway province and opposes its independence. What is the 'One China' policy? What's behind the China-Taiwan divide? Taiwan: A pawn in Trump's chess game with China? Mr Trump has questioned this arrangement, most recently in an interview with the Wall Street Journal where he said ""everything is under negotiation including One China"". China Daily said in an unusually strongly-worded editorial, external on Monday that Mr Trump was ""playing with fire with his Taiwan game"". It said his latest comments appeared to show he intended to use the One China policy as a ""trump card"" and ""bargaining chip"". ""If Trump is determined to use this gambit on taking office, a period of fierce, damaging interactions will be unavoidable, as Beijing will have no choice but to take off the gloves,"" it said. State-owned newspaper China Daily departed from its usual sober tone with its editorial The editorial follows other Chinese warnings made over the weekend in reaction to Mr Trump's latest remarks. On Saturday evening, China's foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said the One China policy was ""non-negotiable"". ""The government of the People's Republic of China is the only legitimate government representing China... That is the fact acknowledged by the international community and no one can change (it)."" An Fengshan, a spokesman for China's Taiwan Affairs Office, also said that any change could mean ""the peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait will be seriously impacted"". A commentary by the hawkish Global Times newspaper, external called Mr Trump ""inexperienced and complacent"", adding: ""In the past, Trump infuriated us, but now we find him risible."" It warned that Mr Trump would meet ""strong countermeasures"" should he change the policy, including moves to ""speed up Taiwan reunification and mercilessly combat"" Taiwan independence advocates. Taiwanese leader Tsai Ing-wen spoke to Mr Trump last month in a historic phone call Mr Trump stunned observers in December when he accepted a phone call from Taiwan's leader Tsai Ing-wen, the first involving a US president or president-elect in decades. He then questioned the One China policy in a Fox News interview that same month. The Chinese government's official reactions so far have been marked by restraint, urging Mr Trump and the US to maintain healthy ties with China and dismissing the phone call as a ""petty trick"" perpetrated by Taiwan. But state media have been more openly critical of Mr Trump and have warned of serious action by Beijing. What is the 'One China' policy? What's behind China-Taiwan tensions?

Hawkish,Inflation hawk to head Indian bank,2024-09-25,2016-08-21,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-37148102,"Mr Patel moves from deputy governor to governor Urjit Patel has been named as the new governor of the Reserve Bank of India - the country's central bank. Mr Patel, currently deputy governor, is a one-time Yale University economist who worked at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in the early 1990s. He is known to be very hawkish on inflation, which remains one of the big worries in the Indian economy. Mr Patel replaces Raghuram Rajan whose term, which was at times controversial, ends on 4 September. Mr Rajan had been expected to stay for a second term but decided to return to academia. This appointment ends months of speculation over who would get one of India's highest-profile jobs. Mr Patel represents continuity and a safe pair of hands. Outgoing governor Raghuram Rajan was one of the world's most well-known central bankers. The new man has less of a global reputation but enough credentials that international investors - so key to India's economic growth - are unlikely to be worried. And the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which has been agonising over this decision for a while, is likely to feel comfortable too. Mr Rajan riled some politicians for weighing into debates seen as being outside the role of a central bank governor - be that tolerance among different religions or the lavish lifestyle of indebted businessmen. Mr Patel will be expected to be lower-key and more conventional.  This is a nation whose food prices can fluctuate widely, often depending on the weather. And for hundreds of millions of Indians being able to afford basic vegetables and pulses is a major concern. This video can not be played Sameer Hashmi on Rajan's decision to leave. However, in a recent interview with the BBC, Mr Rajan denied having ever been publicly critical of Mr Modi's government. Mr Patel takes charge at a time when India has the fastest-growing major economy in the world and its currency, the rupee  - which hit record lows in 2013 - is more stable.  And while there have been concerns about inflation rates creeping up as oil prices recover and food costs rise, many expect the central bank to cut interest rates later this year to help stimulate more growth.

The transparency activist has sought asylum at London's Ecuadorean embassy since 2012 to avoid extradition over sex assault allegations. WikiLeaks accused US Secretary of State John Kerry of asking Ecuador to stop it publishing documents about Hillary Clinton. The US state department said the allegation was ""simply untrue"". Ecuador's Foreign Minister Guillaume Long made no comment on the allegations, saying only: ""The circumstances that led to the granting of asylum remain."" WikiLeaks has recently been releasing emails from Hillary Clinton's campaign. Eleven revelations from Clinton emails Why the US fears Russia is hacking the election Ecuador 'fed up' with Assange embassy 'under siege' The anti-secrecy organisation did not return calls and emails on Monday, though it said in a tweet: ""We have activated the appropriate contingency plans.""

WikiLeaks has released Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's paid speeches to Goldman Sachs The ambassador has not yet responded to emails, and London's Metropolitan Police declined to comment.  The WikiLeaks claim follows emails it disclosed from a hack of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta's emails. It released three transcripts on Saturday of Mrs Clinton's paid speeches to Goldman Sachs, which her campaign had long refused to release. The scripts reveal her bantering relationship with the investment bank's executives, which is unlikely to allay fears among liberal Democrats that she is too cosy with Wall Street. The Democratic White House candidate's camp has claimed the cyber-breach was orchestrated by Russian hackers with the aim of undermining the US democratic process. While Mrs Clinton's team has neither confirmed nor denied the leaked emails are authentic, there have been no indications they are fake.  According to the latest leaked emails, Mrs Clinton told a Goldman Sachs conference she would like to intervene secretly in Syria. She made the remark in answer to a question from Lloyd Blankfein, the bank's chief executive, in 2013 - months after she left office as secretary of state. ""My view was you intervene as covertly as is possible for Americans to intervene,"" she told employees of the bank in South Carolina, which had paid her about $225,000 (£185,000) to give a speech. Mrs Clinton - who is accused of being hawkish by liberal critics - added: ""We used to be much better at this than we are now. Now, you know, everybody can't help themselves.  ""They have to go out and tell their friendly reporters and somebody else: Look what we're doing and I want credit for it."" Assange gets kitten at Ecuador embassy What next for Julian Assange?

She said Germany had ""faced its past squarely"", helping it move forward. Japan has been criticised by its neighbours for what is seen as its inadequate acknowledgement and education of wartime atrocities. PM Shinzo Abe is due to give a statement later this year to mark the 70th anniversary of the end of the war. But there is speculation he may water down Japan's past apologies for its aggression in Asia. Ms Merkel and Mr Abe are expected to use her visit to discuss a free trade agreement, the crisis in Ukraine, and anti-terrorism efforts.  During her lecture - at the headquarters of the Asahi Shimbun newspaper in Tokyo on Monday - Ms Merkel noted that Germany's acceptance into the international community following World War Two was possible because Germany had dealt with its past.  ""There was the acceptance in Germany to call things by their name,"" she said. Mr Abe and Mrs Merkel visited Tokyo's Nezu Museum ahead of talks on trade and global terror What also helped were ""generous gestures by our neighbours"" in re-accepting Germany, she said. France had made ""just as valuable a contribution as the Germans have"" to reconciliation, she added. She said she could not give specific advice on how Japan should deal with the past, but that ""history and experience tells us also that peaceful means of reconciliation have to be found"". Her remarks come a month after Japan's Crown Prince Naruhito urged the country to ""look back humbly on the past"". PM Shinzo Abe, who is known for his hawkish views, has appointed a panel to advise him on a statement he plans to make in August on the 70th anniversary of the end of World War Two. The issue of forgiveness has been for decades the source of diplomatic tension between Japan and its wartime victims, notably China and South Korea.  This tension has ramped up in recent years, particularly since Mr Abe took office in 2012. Veterans pay respects at the Yasukuni shrine - Japan will mark the 70th anniversary of its surrender in WWII in August China and South Korea have denounced visits made by Mr Abe and other senior ministers to Yasukuni Shrine which commemorates Japan's war dead including war criminals. An attempt by his government to review Japan's landmark 1993 apology for forcing Asian women to be sex slaves also drew intense criticism, and was shelved last year. Japanese school history textbooks have long been accused of whitewashing Japan's wartime atrocities.

Hawkish,Why are rail fares going up again?,2024-09-25,2014-08-19,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-28850855,"Rail tickets are about to go up again - by an average of 3.5% from January 2015.  That's 1% above inflation - and will apply to all regulated fares, including season tickets. That is unless George Osborne decides to protect passengers by limiting fare rises to no more than inflation - as he did for 2014. The actual pounds and pence price hikes won't be revealed until Christmas time. Rail companies are allowed a little wiggle room, called ""flex"", which currently lets them put some fares up by as much as RPI plus 2%, as long as it is balanced out with smaller rises, or even cuts elsewhere. So you may be facing an even bigger hike than the average rise announced. In a nutshell, the government wants passengers to pick up more of the bill for running the railways.  It all started in 2007 when a White Paper called 'Delivering a Sustainable Railway' effectively set a target to get about three-quarters of the money from fares and just a quarter from the taxpayer by 2014.  So that is why fares keep going up, and will keep going up for a while yet. The government also says it is paying for huge, multi-billion pound improvements across the network, from electrifying lines to brand new stations and trains.  Our regulated fares are some of the highest in Europe. But there are still lots of cheap deals out there if you can book well in advance and travel off-peak. Couple that with the cost of running a car, with pricey insurance and petrol, and the train becomes a more attractive proposition.  One senior rail executive told the BBC that, if you analyse it per person per mile, season tickets are by far the cheapest deal they offer. In fact, he said, they make a loss on them, and the fare rise goes to the government. Higher fares are needed to pay for track improvements, says the government The Office for National Statistics has two inflation indexes - the Retail Prices Index (RPI) and Consumer Prices Index (CPI) - that measure the rising costs of goods and services in different ways. One of the key differences between the two main indexes is that RPI includes housing costs such as mortgage interest payments and council tax, whereas CPI does not. RPI is normally bigger than CPI, which obviously means fare rises are higher. Yet the government uses CPI for setting pension and benefit rises, for example, so the accusation is that they use CPI it when it is useful to have a smaller number; RPI when they want a bigger number. ""The use of RPI is consistent with the general indexation approach adopted across the rail industry,"" said a spokesman for the Department for Transport. ""The Office of Rail Regulation uses RPI as the index for Network Rail's revenues, eg Track Access Charges."" No, basically. The Scottish government says increases in regulated peak fares will be capped at RPI in January 2015. And regulated off-peak fares are frozen provided that RPI remains below 3.5% per annum. The Welsh government has yet to decide what to do and in Northern Ireland there is no planned increase. Labour said it would abolish the ""flex"" element of fare rises - which allows train operators to raise some regulated fares above the formula, providing it reduces others. But that would not necessarily stop above-inflation fare rises. In its last command paper, the government promised to address ""the concerns about rail fares and the impact they have on hard-pressed families - by ending inflation-busting increases in average regulated fares at the earliest opportunity"". That is the promise, although they cannot put a timescale on it.  Rail travellers hit by fare rises How quickly are prices rising in the UK?"
Hawkish,Interest rates rise for first time in three years,2024-09-25,2021-12-16,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-59682521,"The Bank of England has raised interest rates for the first time in more than three years, in response to calls to tackle surging price rises. The increase to 0.25% from 0.1% followed data this week that showed prices climbing at the fastest pace for 10 years. It came despite fears the Omicron variant could slow the economy by causing people to spend less. The Bank's action is set to increase the mortgage costs of some homeowners. Bank governor Andrew Bailey said it needed to tackle strong inflationary pressures building up in the economy. Inflation is now running at 5.1%, the highest in a decade, and he expects it to rise further early next year. ""In the short term - that is, in the next two or three months - we think it can get to around 6%,"" he told the BBC. A rise in wholesale gas prices is still a big factor driving inflation, and that is continuing to push up domestic energy bills. But one business group said the interest rate rise would do little to stop prices going up, since costs were being pushed higher by global factors largely outside the Bank's control. The decision by the Bank of England will add just over £15 to the typical monthly repayment for a tracker mortgage customer.  A standard variable rate mortgage-holder is likely to pay nearly £10 extra a month. Nearly two million people in the UK have one of these two types of mortgage. While savers may welcome news of higher rates, analysts warn there is no guarantee the higher Bank rate will lead to better returns on savings. Even if savings rates increase slightly, returns are still well below the rate of inflation. The Bank can raise interest rates to help control price rises - but many experts had expected it to hold off because of uncertainty about Omicron.  Yet on Thursday, it said the prices of global assets, such as stocks and bonds, had largely recovered after an initial fall triggered by news of the new variant. Successive waves of Covid also appeared to have had less impact on economic growth, the Bank added, although there was uncertainty around the extent to which that would prove to be the case this time. ""Consumer price inflation in advanced economies has risen by more than expected,"" the Bank said. The Omicron variant could reduce economic activity early next year, said the Bank, although it was unclear how much of an effect it would have on inflation worldwide.  Mr Bailey told the BBC the Bank's rate-setters had thought ""long and hard"" about the impact of Omicron on economic activity before making their decision.  ""But it is not at all clear if the impact [on the economy] could cause inflation to come down, or even go up,"" he said. The Bank of England seems to like a surprise. Last month, acknowledging the expectation of an interest rate rise happening, it held off. This month, with the main development being the spread of Omicron, it has raised at a time when most expected it to hold. It goes to show that the arguments have been finely balanced. The other development has been that inflation has hit even harder and even faster than expected. Six per cent is now the expected peak in the spring, which will represent the highest rate of inflation on the targeted CPI measure for 30 years. It is treble the Bank of England's target. While it is important to note that a 0.15% rise is modest and still leaves base rates very close to historic lows, it is not ideal that this comes at the precise moment where some forms of consumer confidence, especially in terms of going out, appear to be slumping. The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee was briefed by the Chief Medical Officer, Chris Whitty, and intriguingly chose to mention the possibility that Omicron could raise inflationary pressure by further hobbling supply chains for goods, and the supply of workers. The argument will be that it is better to nip expectations of inflation in the bud, than try to contain them once they get going. A rise now is preferable, in the eyes of the MPC, to having to rise by even more over the next year or two. The Bank is choosing to act on what it knows about inflation, rather than hold back on what it doesn't know about Omicron. Not at all. The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 8-1 in favour of the increase. The dissenting MPC member, Silvana Tenreyro, voted to keep rates as they were. Rates had been at 0.1%, a record low, since March last year, when they were cut in response to the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. It was the second month in a row that Bank policymakers had surprised the markets. Economists had expected a rate rise at the MPC's last meeting in November, but policymakers voted to hold fire. This time, analysts expected a further delay because of Omicron, but the committee thought differently. ""The Bank of England's decision to raise interest rates was surprising, given mounting uncertainty over the economic impact of the Omicron variant,"" said Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce. ""While today's rate increase may have little effect on most firms, many will view this as the first step in a longer policy movement - not as a partial reversal of last year's cut.""  He added that the current inflationary spike was mostly driven by global factors, so higher interest rates would do little to curb further increases in inflation. Instead, the government needed to find practical solutions to the UK's supply chain problems and labour shortages, he said. Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said the move suggested that the Bank had become ""a bit more hawkish"" and might now think rates need to rise further than before.  ""The MPC once again said that a 'modest tightening' of monetary policy is likely to be necessary, so this is not looking like a case of one and done,"" he added. ""We still think that weaker economic growth and a faster fall in inflation will mean that interest rates won't rise to 1% by the end of next year, but it's just become more likely that they rise above our 0.5% forecast."" The MPC also voted unanimously to maintain the Bank's asset purchase scheme at £875bn. The last time the Bank raised interest rates was in August 2018, when they reached 0.75%. They were then cut twice in March 2020 at the start of the pandemic. Do you have a tracker mortgage and will now see your repayments rise?

Hawkish,Train drivers overwhelmingly middle-aged white men,2024-09-25,2024-04-30,By Paul Clifton,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-hampshire-68921391,"The average train driver is 46 years old, male and white, according to new data compiled by an industry body. The National Skills Academy for Rail (NSAR) figures show that only one in ten drivers are non-white, with even fewer being women. The rail industry has long recognised itself as being one of the least diverse employment sectors.  Southern Railway said it is trying to enable a wider range of people to apply for jobs. Donna Pryce is an apprentice driver at the company, on a training course at Selhurst Depot near Croydon.  ""It was my experience, growing up, that all the drivers were fifty-plus, white men,"" she said.  ""But lately I am seeing a lot more diversity. More younger people, black people, women. I'm here for it, I love it!"" 22-year-old George Browning, from Portsmouth, is Southern's youngest trainee driver. He said: ""It has been a dream goal for me since I was a little boy. The median age of train drivers is quite high, so I definitely feel like one of the young ones. Age doesn't matter, but I'm proud to achieve that at a young age."" Zoey Hudson, head of talent, diversity and inclusion at Southern railway, said recruitment methods had changed to enable a wider range of people to apply for jobs.  ""It's really important that we have diversity of thinking within the railway, which is as important as diversity of ethnicity,"" she said.  ""It freshens us as an organisation, it brings creativity, so that we get different people enriching the working environment for the railway of the future. Ultimately, the railway will look and feel different, and that will make a more successful business."" But train drivers remain overwhelmingly male, and overwhelmingly white.  Fewer than one in ten drivers are women: 91.5% are men,  8.5% are women, up from 6% two years ago.  More than nine in ten drivers are white: 90.8%, with 9.2% coming from other ethnicities.  NSAR also compiled statistics for drivers under the age of 40. It found the proportion of female drivers is significantly higher for this younger group, at 14%. The proportion of non-white drivers is higher too, also at 14%. NSAR told the BBC: ""Indicators are heading in the right direction, often as a result of government action to improve the deployment of apprenticeships for new train drivers. ""Average age is decreasing, gender balance increasing."" NSAR's data does not include services run by Transport for London.  It said that Elizabeth Line and Overground services, run by MTR and Arriva respectively, show greater diversity - with two in three Elizabeth Line drivers under 45 years old, and one in three non-white.  On Overground services, more than half of all drivers are from non-white backgrounds. But on both operators, nine in ten drivers are male. Follow BBC South on Facebook, X, or Instagram.

Hawkish,Planners advised to reject Torquay's big wheel,2024-09-25,2024-04-23,Guy Henderson,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c97zg6vevvjo,"Torquay’s seafront big wheel, which has been a feature of Torbay’s summer landscape for more than a decade, could be missing this year. Torbay Council's planning officers have advised members of the planning committee to reject the wheel's operator's application. Mellors apply for permission annually to put the big wheel next the Princess Theatre. Officers described the ride as ""alien and incongruous"". A council spokesperson said: “In this case, officers have concluded that the harm to local heritage outweighs the benefits presented.” Torbay Council's planning meeting is scheduled for Monday 29 April, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. Mellors want to put up their 45-metre wheel, a ticket office and a catering unit in the council-owned Princess Gardens. They would pay £30,000 towards resurfacing pathways in the gardens. But the planning committee will hear the site is a sensitive location in the Torquay Harbour Conservation Area and next to a listed war memorial and fountain. Rob Palmer, Torbay Council's principal historic environment officer, said the development would not ""enhance"" the area. “The wheel and its associated structures appear as alien and incongruous features. ""The proposals in their current form would neither preserve nor enhance the character or appearance of the identified conservation area.” ""In this case, officers have concluded that the harm to local heritage outweighs the benefits presented. Meanwhile, work to install an observation wheel arrived at Dawlish Warren is underway. Located on Beach Walk, the development received permission to be installed at Dawlish Warren for six months. The wheel is being transported in small sections underneath the Dawlish Warren railway bridge, and will be opened to the public next week.

Network Rail will demolish a bridge with deteriorating cast iron girders by Hackney Downs Park and install a new structure, from 20 July to 4 August. No London Overground services will run between Hackney Downs and Chingford. Network Rail said the new bridge was designed to last for 120 years. It apologised for the disruption. Some Greater Anglia trains, which usually call at Liverpool Street, will terminate at Stratford instead while Stansted Airport and Cambridge services will be diverted to Seven Sisters instead of Tottenham Hale. London Overground timetables between Enfield Town and Cheshunt may change during the work. Downs Park Road, east London, is expected to remain closed to vehicles until early 2025, while cyclists and pedestrians will be unable to use it from July. Simon Milburn, Network Rail Anglia infrastructure director, said: ""We're sorry for the disruption this summer but we'll be working flat out to deliver a replacement bridge that will serve the community for generations to come.""

Hawkish,Accused 'did not feel knife going into student',2024-09-25,2024-04-18,By Pritti Mistry,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-humber-68848949,"A student accused of stabbing his housemate to death in a row over music has told jurors he did not feel the knife going into the victim. Sachin Hawkins was fatally stabbed at the shared house in Hardy Street, Hull, in November 2023. Syed Hussain-Kazi, 25, of Hardy Street, denies murder. Hull Crown Court heard the pair had traded insults, which the defendant said had become ""more threatening"" and escalated to ""a scuffle"". Mr Hussain-Kazi told the jury he and Mr Hawkins were having ""banter"" when the defendant ""started poking fun"" at his taste in music, but the mood in the student house then changed. The court heard Mr Hussain-Kazi had drank two bottles of alcohol and was helping another housemate to clean up in the kitchen when he picked up a knife to wash up. Mr Hussain-Kazi said the 19-year-old twice repeated an insult but ""the second time he seemed a bit more threatening."" ""He came close to me so I grabbed him by the collar and pushed him back,"" said the defendant. During the ""scuffle"", Mr Hawkins ""slipped and lost his balance"" before falling, the court heard. ""I didn't deliberately go stab him in the chest. I just remember a scuffle happening,"" Mr Hussain-Kazi told jurors. He denied feeling the knife going in and out of Mr Hawkins. ""I didn't feel any penetration from the knife,"" he said. Mr Hussain-Kazi said he dropped the knife when he saw blood and grabbed a tea towel to put on Mr Hawkins' chest. When asked by his defence barrister David Lamb KC if he intended to kill Mr Hawkins, the defendant replied: ""I did not intend to kill him."" Mr Hussain-Kazi told the court he ""wasn't entirely sure of events"" on the night of 15 November as he could not remember. The court heard he had previous convictions for two offences, including a knifepoint street robbery in 2019, in which the defendant was carrying a kitchen knife. Jurors heard the defendant could also not remember another incident in November 2022 in which prosecutors claimed he ""waved"" a knife in front of a student's face at university halls of residence. Prosecutors told the jury Mr Hawkins ""wasn't a threat"" to the defendant, who had stabbed him through the heart"" with a 15cm-long (6in) knife. The trial at Hull Crown Court continues.

Hawkish,"Inflation uncertainty has risen, Fed chair warns",2024-09-25,2021-11-30,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-59480099,"The emergence of Omicron raises the uncertainty around inflation, the chair of the Federal Reserve has warned. Rising rates of Covid, plus the new variant, pose new risks to the US economy, Jerome Powell told a Congressional committee. In the past Mr Powell has called recent high rates of inflation transitory, a term he said should now be ""retired"". He also said the Fed should consider tapering its bond-buying stimulus more quickly. During the course of the pandemic the Federal Reserve has been praised for warding off recession with its asset purchasing programme. This month it began the process of reducing that support, the first step towards increasing the cost of borrowing, the usual policy strategy to tame inflation. However a debate has arisen over whether the support should be withdrawn more rapidly. Some economists argue that faster tapering, and an earlier move to higher interest rates, are needed to tackle prices which are rising at their fastest pace for 30 years. Mr Powell has argued that higher prices are the result of pandemic disruption, including to supply chains, and swings in consumer demand. He predicted inflation would fade as the pandemic eased. However, the emergence of Omicron has shaken global markets, raising the prospect that restrictions on travel, social and economic activity could be extended further. ""The recent rise in Covid-19 cases and the emergence of the Omicron variant pose downside risks to employment and economic activity and increased uncertainty for inflation,"" Mr Powell told the Senate banking committee. ""Greater concerns about the virus could reduce people's willingness to work in person, which would slow progress in the labour market and intensify supply-chain disruptions,"" he added. When asked about his view of whether inflation could still be described as transitory, Mr Powell said: ""It is probably a good time to retire that word, and explain more clearly what we mean."" He said he believed that high inflation would persist until the middle of next year, and so the central bank is ""likely"" to discuss speeding up the tapering of its asset-buying programme. The markets have interpreted the statements as a change of tone from the Federal Reserve chair, indicating a shift towards a tighter monetary policy. ""We've long maintained that the Fed is the ultimate owner of the 'transitory' characterisation and the chair's decision to move beyond that is a decidedly hawkish step,"" said Ian Lyngen at BMO Capital Markets."
Hawkish,UK defends submarine deal amid criticism,2024-09-25,2021-09-19,By Alex Therrien,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-58613195,"The UK's new security agreement with the US and Australia will make it safer and could create hundreds of new jobs, the new foreign secretary has said. The pact, known as Aukus, will see Australia being given the technology to build nuclear-powered submarines. Liz Truss said it showed the UK's readiness to be ""hard-headed"" in defending its interests. But France, whose own submarine deal with Australia was thwarted as a result, has criticised the agreement. It has recalled its ambassadors in the US and Australia for consultations in response, while China has accused the three powers of having a ""Cold War mentality"".  The alliance - widely seen as an effort to counter China's influence in the contested South China Sea - was announced by US President Joe Biden, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his Australian counterpart Scott Morrison on Wednesday. Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, Ms Truss said the partnership showed the UK's commitment to stability in the Indo-Pacific region.  She wrote: ""Freedoms need to be defended, so we are also building strong security ties around the world. ""This is about more than foreign policy in the abstract, but delivering for people across the UK and beyond by partnering with like-minded countries to build coalitions based on shared values and shared interests.""  Ms Truss, who was was promoted from international trade secretary to foreign secretary in the reshuffle this week, said the pact ""will not just make us safer at home, it could also create hundreds of new and high-skilled jobs, from the shipyards of Govan to the factories of Tyneside"".  The pact, which will also see the allies share cyber capabilities, artificial intelligence and other undersea technologies, was described as showing ""profound strategic shifts"" by the UK's national security adviser Stephen Lovegrove. But some have expressed fears that it could provoke China into a war. This week, former Prime Minister Theresa May asked Mr Johnson about the ""implications"" of the partnership in the event of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan.  Democratic Taiwan sees itself as a sovereign state, but Beijing has increased pressure on the island which it views as a breakaway province. Mr Johnson told MPs that the Aukus agreement was ""not intended to be adversarial"" to China but the UK was ""determined to defend international law"". Clumsy diplomacy, heightened emotions and spy-like secrecy: the row over the new security pact between the UK, the US and Australia has it all.  But amid the increasingly shrill invective from humiliated French ministers, there is a fundamental truth: the West is struggling to make up its mind about China. Washington has now been joined by Canberra and London in acting together to address the security challenge.  Other countries - particularly some in Europe - are less hawkish, still trying to split the difference between economic co-operation and strategic competition with Beijing.  France is furious at the breach of contract by Australia and the lack of trust shown by the US and the UK. So there is talk in the French papers of further retaliation, beyond the recall of ambassadors, perhaps involving Nato.  Others are speculating this row might finally encourage Europe to agree some greater strategic autonomy.  The truth is more straightforward: if the West wishes to protect its interests in the Indo-Pacific, then France and other European powers need to be on the same page as the US and its Anglophone allies. And right now both sides are not even reading the same book.  Meanwhile, France's foreign minister has accused Australia and the US of lying over the deal. Speaking on Saturday, Jean-Yves Le Drian said a ""serious crisis"" was in progress between the allies. ""The fact that for the first time in the history of relations between the United States and France we are recalling our ambassador for consultations is a serious political act, which shows the magnitude of the crisis that exists now between our countries,"" he told France 2. But he said France had seen ""no need"" to recall its ambassador to the UK, accusing the country of ""constant opportunism"". ""Britain in this whole thing is a bit like the third wheel,"" he said. The pact means Australia will become just the seventh nation in the world to operate nuclear-powered submarines. The announcement ended a deal worth $37bn (£27bn) that France had signed with Australia in 2016 to build 12 conventional submarines."

Hawkish,Five reasons why Putin might not invade Ukraine,2024-09-25,2022-02-21,By Frank Gardner,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-60468264,"The optics look dreadful. Russia has deployed more than two-thirds of its military combat capability to within striking distance of Ukraine's borders. Its 30,000 troops that were supposed to withdraw from neighbouring Belarus at the weekend are still there. So are pontoon bridges and other logistic equipment needed for an invasion.  Violence is flaring in the two Russian-backed breakaway republics in Eastern Ukraine. Russia's demands from Nato remain unmet and diplomacy has so far failed to bring about any significant withdrawal of Russian forces. Meanwhile western leaders and their intelligence chiefs have been sounding the alarm, asserting that President Putin has already given the order to invade Ukraine.  And yet, there are reasons to believe that a full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine might not happen. Here are some of them. Ukraine will resist, at least initially. Its forces are vastly outnumbered and outgunned by Russia's but that doesn't mean there won't be severe casualties on both sides.  If Moscow were to undertake a full-scale invasion, capturing the major cities of Kyiv, Kharkiv and Odessa by force then it could well involve protracted and costly street fighting where the Ukrainians would be on home ground. A recent poll of young Russians found that a majority were opposed to waging war against their Slavic neighbour.  The prospect of large numbers of both Russians and Ukrainians dying in a war of Putin's choice and Russians coming home in coffins will not play well at home.  How deep the threatened western sanctions go will, in all likelihood, depend on how deep Russia goes into Ukraine.  Much as western leaders talk of Nato unanimity the reality is that Germany and Hungary, for example, which depend in large part on Russian gas, are not as hawkish as Britain, which is not.  But sanctions will still hurt the relatively small Russian economy, especially if it is frozen out of the Swift banking system as some are calling for.  When Russia invaded and annexed Crimea in 2014 it became an international pariah for years. The same would happen this time, only worse.  Even China, a strategic ally, has warned against it with its Foreign Minister Wang Yi telling the Munich Security Conference: ""The sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of every country should be safeguarded. Ukraine is no exception."" US Senator Chris Murphy believes that contrary to the optics, Putin is in a severely weak position and ""a potentially disastrous invasion of Ukraine would be his last resort"".  He believes that after 2013 Ukraine's people made it clear they no longer wanted to be in Russia's orbit and forcing them back with a costly war would devastate the Russian economy and possibly even unseat President Putin. Moscow has now got the West's attention when it comes to the perceived injustices of the post-Cold War security order in Europe.  From Putin's perspective, Nato has reneged on the deal not to expand eastwards towards Russia's borders.  Not only have the three Baltic republics (all former Soviet Socialist Republics) Poland and other former Warsaw Pact countries all joined Nato but now the prospect of neighbouring Ukraine doing the same is too much for Moscow to bear.  Putin wants this changed or the Damoclean sword of a Russian invasion will forever hang over Ukraine. ""He wants to negotiate a new security deal but from a position of strength"" says Ghanem Nuseibeg, a Senior Visiting Fellow at Harvard. ""In a way he has already partially succeeded with Macron talking of a new security order.""    Set against all of the above are some very compelling reasons to believe that a Russian invasion will happen, and imminently, even if it is confined to just the two internationally unrecognised breakaway republics in the east of Ukraine.  The size, scale and nature of Russia's military build-up go far beyond the needs of a normal military exercise. You don't ask soldiers to give blood to field dressing stations if you're just on manoeuvres.  Moscow's two core demands from the West remain unmet, namely a promise that Ukraine will never be allowed to join Nato and that the western alliance withdraw all its forces from countries that joined Nato after 1997. Ultimately, the Kremlin has clearly decided that it cannot tolerate its giant, Slavic-speaking neighbour Ukraine being firmly in the western camp, becoming part of Nato and the EU. President Putin has made it abundantly clear by his actions so far that he will do whatever it takes to stop that from happening. "

Services at Teignmouth Hospital will move to Dawlish Hospital and to a new £8m health centre in the town centre.   The decision to close was reviewed by an independent panel after Devon County Council said it was unhappy with the consultation. However, campaigners say community beds are ""desperately needed"" and a petition was signed by 1,000 people.  In March 2021 Devon County Council's health and scrutiny committee reconsidered the decision made by NHS Devon's clinical commissioning group (CCG)  and decided it was unhappy with the lack of consultation over the future of the community hospital. Health secretary, Sajid Javid agreed to the request and said the potential closure would be reviewed by a panel of independent experts.  The panel has since ruled the CCG's consultation with the county council committee was ""adequate"", said the Local Democracy Reporting Service. However, the independent panel did say there were ""lessons to be learned for both parties"".  The report from the panel said the future of the community hospital ""had been in plain sight for everyone and open for discussion with the NHS since 2018"".  However, in ""hindsight"" the CCG said it ""could have been more explicit in its communication"" with the public, the panel revealed. It also said the NHS must engage with the local community to ""determine the future"" of the community hospital.  Anne Marie Morris, Independent MP for Newton Abbot, said the decision made by NHS Devon's Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) was not one she welcomed.  ""I remain very concerned that this decision is not in the best interests of Teignmouth residents,"" she said.  Dr David Greenwell from NHS Devon CCG said he was ""pleased"" the independent panel found that the ""CCG has fulfilled its responsibilities"".

Hawkish,Why did Trump dump his security adviser?,2024-09-25,2017-02-20,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39033934,"McMaster has been labelled the world's ""pre-eminent warrior-thinker"" US President Donald Trump has replaced his National Security Adviser Herbert Raymond McMaster after just over a year on the job, replacing him with Bush-era war hawk John Bolton. General McMaster's character had reportedly rubbed members of the Trump administration the wrong way. Mr Trump had referred to the army lieutenant general's briefings as ""gruff and condescending"", a source told CNN. He was also described as ""aggressive"" and prone to lecture. Politico reports that Mr Trump once interrupted him during a lengthy briefing to say: ""Look at this guy, he's so serious!"" The Washington Post said the two had never personally ""gelled"". The Lt Gen is a student of history - and a fierce critic of decisions leading up to the Vietnam War Mr Trump publicly criticised his national security adviser on Twitter in February after Gen McMaster told a forum in Germany it was ""incontrovertible"" that Russians had meddled in the 2016 presidential election. ""General McMaster forgot to say that the results of the 2016 election were not impacted or changed by the Russians and that the only Collusion was between Russia and Crooked H, the DNC and the Dems,"" a clearly peeved Mr Trump tweeted. It was reported last year that President Trump had also grumbled about Gen McMaster's plan to deploy more forces to America's longest war. ""He wants to send more troops to Afghanistan, so we're going to send him,"" Mr Trump was quoted as saying. The president nevertheless ultimately approved the deployment of thousands more troops that August. Mr Trump reportedly floated the idea of actually assigning Gen McMaster to take over as commander in Afghanistan, and give him a top-ranking fourth star. Gen McMaster replaced Lt Gen Michael Flynn, who was fired after less than a month in the job for misleading the White House about his contacts with the Russian ambassador. As a decorated war hero who had served in command roles in Iraq and Afghanistan, Gen McMaster seemed like the ideal candidate to counsel the commander-in-chief. This video can not be played US Army Lt General H R McMaster says use of Shia militias in operations against IS in Iraq is a ""grave concern"" Time magazine lauded him in 2014 as possibly ""the 21st Century Army's pre-eminent warrior-thinker"". But given that Gen McMaster's 1997 PhD dissertation in history argued that military top brass should have stood up to the president during the Vietnam War, he was never likely to be a wallflower in the Oval Office. Gen McMaster was said to be forthright in arguing that President Trump should not scrap the Obama-era nuclear agreement with Iran. The national security adviser struck a hawkish tone on North Korea, suggesting the US should not put up with the country having nuclear arms. ""We can't tolerate that risk,"" he told CBS.  As soon as he was appointed, Gen McMaster set about purging acolytes of his predecessor from his team. The counter-insurgency expert also found himself in a battle of attrition against White House chief strategist Steve Bannon. Mr Bannon's reported efforts to oust Gen McMaster backfired when he himself was shown the door. But the national security adviser's victory was short-lived and now he, too, has been jettisoned.

Hawkish,'Japan could shoot down' Korea missiles,2024-09-25,2017-11-06,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-41882272,"US President Donald Trump has said Japan could shoot North Korean missiles ""out of the sky"" with military equipment bought from the US. Japan's PM Shinzo Abe followed up by saying his country could intercept missiles ""if necessary"", and added that he was looking into the deal. The two leaders were speaking to reporters at the close of Mr Trump's first state visit to Japan. North Korea has fired missiles over Japan twice in recent months. On Monday, while answering questions at a press conference, Mr Trump said Mr Abe was ""going to purchase massive amounts of military equipment"" from the US. Referencing North Korea's missiles, he said Mr Abe could ""shoot them out of the sky"" when he completed the purchase, which Mr Trump said would provide jobs to Americans as well as ""safety for Japan"". Mr Abe said he was considering such a deal, adding that Japan had to ""qualitatively and quantitatively"" enhance its defence capability, given the ""very tough"" North Korea situation. He stressed that missile defence was based on ""legal co-operation"" between Japan and the US, and as for shooting down missiles, ""if necessary of course we can do that"". It is not clear whether a military deal has been signed during Mr Trump's trip, but the two countries are close military allies with the US maintaining several military bases in Japan. In September Mr Trump had tweeted that he would allow the sale of high-end military equipment to Japan and South Korea. Japan does not have a standing army, but instead maintains what it calls self-defence forces, under its post-war pacifist constitution which the hawkish Mr Abe has been seeking to revise. The two leaders also reaffirmed their ties and pledged to ""stand against the North Korean menace"", said Mr Trump. Mr Abe said Japan was imposing sanctions on several North Korean entities and individuals. Earlier on Monday, North Korean state media accused Mr Trump of driving tensions ""to the extremes"" and said that ""no-one can predict when the lunatic old man of the White House, lost to senses, will start a nuclear war"" against North Korea. Mr Trump on Monday met families of Japanese people abducted by North Korea - a topic which he later addressed in the press conference, calling it a ""very, very sad thing"". He said it would be ""a tremendous signal"" and ""the start of something very special"" if North Korean leader Kim Jong-un returned the abductees, something which Mr Abe has constantly pushed for. The two leaders also said they discussed economic co-operation in the region. Mr Trump is visiting Japan as part of his first tour of Asia as US president. He has also visited a US air base near Tokyo, and met American business leaders where he publicly criticised Japan over a trade deficit. Mr Trump will be going to South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines in the coming week."
Hawkish,How the Paralympic ceremonies were made,2024-09-25,2018-08-28,By Tim Stokes,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-45297769,"Six years ago spectators, royals and dignitaries descended on the Olympic Stadium in east London for the 2012 Paralympics opening ceremony. The lavish event on 29 August marked the first time the Paralympics had come back home to Britain. The forerunner to what became the Paralympics was held in the grounds of Stoke Mandeville Hospital 70 years ago, when injured servicemen and women took part in an archery competition organised to coincide with the 1948 London Olympic Games. By 2012 the Paralympics had expanded into a much larger event, with 4,237 athletes from 164 countries competing. The creation of both the opening and closing ceremonies of the games was captured on camera by Ben Delfont while he worked as a senior stage manager on the performances. Delfont mostly works on theatre shows in London such as The Ferryman, Mojo and The Inheritance but got involved with the Games having taken part in similar events over previous years. ""I'd worked on the Olympic and Paralympic ceremonies in Athens and Vancouver,"" he explains. Rehearsals began in studios in Bow before moving to the huge disused Ford plant in Dagenham. Some of the performers also honed their performances at an eight-week skills training programme in Hackney. From Dagenham, the huge array of props and vehicles was transported to the Olympic Stadium in Stratford for dress rehearsals. More than 3,000 adult volunteers and over 100 professional performers, many of whom had disabilities, took part in the opening ceremony that evening. Delfont describes the process of putting it all together as ""a very unifying and wonderful experience"". ""The sense of camaraderie and togetherness during that time was amazing,"" he said. The opening ceremony was entitled Enlightenment and borrowed ideas from William Shakespeare's The Tempest. Stephen Hawking opened the ceremony with a speech while Sir Ian McKellen also made an appearance. Umbrellas were a central theme. The event was watched by a crowd of some 80,000 people in the stadium, including the Queen. The closing ceremony was a much more fiery affair featuring large amounts of pyrotechnics, ""steampunk"" vehicles, and Coldplay - a band probably not well known for their fieriness. About 7.7m people tuned in to see it broadcast on TV in the UK, on Channel 4. The dramatic images taken by Delfont as he worked on the productions also proved very useful for the organisers of the Games. ""They used them in the VIP areas for the ceremonies themselves,"" he said. All images courtesy of Ben Delfont"
Hawkish,Celebrating the flower growers of Britain,2024-09-25,2018-06-18,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/in-pictures-44481152,"We are a nation of farmers, of gardeners, of flower lovers, and our cut flower industry is worth more than two billion pounds a year. Photographer Tessa Bunney has been documenting the work of flower growers, and here we share some of her work to mark British Flowers Week.. Flower farms were once a familiar feature of the British countryside and market gardeners grew flowers among their vegetables.  In the 1800s, larger farms sprang up as transport links improved and daily trains carried violets from Dawlish, snowdrops from Lincolnshire and narcissi from Cornwall.  Flower production has always been linked to transport, and with the advent of planes came distance. Now we can have any flowers at any time of year, flown in from the Equator, or hothoused in vast Dutch greenhouses. Recently a number of smaller British flower farms have sprung up, fed by fresh interest in environmental sustainability and local seasonal produce. Tessa Bunney is working in collaboration with members of the non-profit organisation Flowers from the Farm to celebrate the domestic flower growers of Britain, past and present. FarmerFlorist by Tessa Bunney is on show at the Ryedale Folk Museum, Hutton-le-Hole, North Yorkshire from 16 June to 15 July.  British Flowers Week runs from 18 to 24 June.

Hawkish,US paper's London crime appeal backfires,2024-09-25,2018-12-13,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-46557035,"An appeal by The New York Times asking readers to share experiences of petty crime in London backfired - when it was hijacked by sarcastic Brits. The esteemed US organ had said it wanted to hear about the Metropolitan Police response to ""minor property crimes"" such as burglary. Instead, it was deluged with thousands of comedy replies on Twitter, including complaints about accidental eye contact on the Tube and badly made tea. It has yet to respond. The Times posted its earnest appeal for London-based tales of woe amid what it called a ""surge in violent crime"" in the capital, telling users it would select the best for publication. However, its social media feeds saw a surge of a different kind, as a deluge of tongue-in-cheek ripostes rolled in and Londoners lapped up the chance to have a laugh at the expense of the paper (and themselves). The unspoken laws of using the London Underground featured heavily among the responses. ""Someone made eye contact with me on the tube once. The culprit is still at large, despite a massive police operation,"" wrote ralasdair. Actor Stephen McGann went one step further, and said his antagonist had even smiled after meeting his gaze - a London Underground faux-pas of the highest magnitude. While Tom Parker Bowles reserved his ire for someone - probably a tourist - who stood on the ""left-hand side of the down escalators at Shepherd's Bush"". Hurried commuter ChazpLDN chipped in: ""A charlatan didn't have his Oyster card ready this morning before getting to the front of the underground queue. Audible tutting ensued."" Others took the opportunity to grass up fellow Brits for their dodgy tea-making practices. ""While visiting an acquaintance who lives in Shepherd's Bush, she offered to make me a cup of tea. I said yes and she put the milk in first,"" @quicunquevult said. Elsewhere, there was ferocious satire of British manners. The Soho Theatre tweeted a scandalous tale of two audience members who once tried to sit in the same seat. Neither apologised, it said. ""It was mayhem, we had to cancel the show."" While Matt Walsh expressed ""horror"" at his neighbours, who ""left their bins out for two days after they were emptied"". The paper was seeking input for a piece by its London-based reporter Ceylan Yeginsu, who said her apartment had been burgled. It is yet to be seen how many of the responses will make it into the final piece."

It will be used to install new netting and fencing along the rail link, future-proofing the line following the storms in 2014, the government said. Three phases of work have already been carried out to prevent debris reaching the railway. The sea wall has also been rebuilt along the Marine Parade and further cliff protection measures added.  In 2014 the railway was damaged beyond use for six weeks after storms. Following this, the South West Rail Resilience Programme (SWRRP) was launched and since then £155m of funding has been pledged for the South West in total, to ensure that communities will not be disconnected from the rail network for long periods of time. Rail Minister, Wendy Morton said: ""Devon's iconic sea wall, and the picturesque towns surrounding it, are jewels in the British crown, and we're committed to protecting this vital line and the communities it serves. ""Through our wider £155m investment, we're also working to boost connectivity and support the thriving local economy and tourism."" The total investment aims to level-up connections between communities in the South West, the government said. Mike Gallop, Network Rail's western route director, said: ""We are delighted to once again receive the support from government which enables us to carry out the next phase of our resilience work between Dawlish and Teignmouth. ""This will mean that passengers using GWR and CrossCountry services on this vital rail link to and from the South West will have more reliable journeys as the railway along the Devon coast will be better protected from rising sea levels, extreme weather, landslips and rockfalls for the next 100 years.""

Hawkish,Where does Trump's 'America First' leave Canada?,2024-09-25,2018-05-02,By Jessica Murphy,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-43786775,"Donald Trump has been keeping Canada on its toes since he became US president at the start of last year. When it comes to matters of trade, Mr Trump has been resolutely hawkish, vowing repeatedly to put ""America first"". As the US is far and away Canada's largest trading partner, this has inevitably caused concern north of the border. And given that Mr Trump has repeatedly threatened to tear up the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) between the US, Canada, and Mexico, alarm in Ottawa has been somewhat justified. Especially as Donald Trump's administration has already hit Canadian softwood lumber with import tariffs of more than 20%. Mr Trump hasn't pulled the US out of Nafta, despite having once called it ""the worst trade deal ever made"". Instead talks have taken place since August of last year between US, Canadian and Mexican trade representatives to agree a new deal. While a deadline of 1 May to sign a new agreement came and went, a new one has been set for 1 June, and face-to-face talks are due to resume on 7 May. In Ottawa there is renewed optimism that a decent deal can be agreed. ""There is positive momentum, but as we all know it won't be done until it's done,"" Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Monday.  Yet despite key voices south of the border backing Canada's call for a positive new Nafta agreement, such as the US Chamber of Commerce, some Canadian industries remain nervous. ""There's a lot of worry,"" says Francois Dumontier, spokesman for the Milk Producers of Quebec organisation. Dairy farms in Quebec and across Canada in general are concerned about the talks because of Mr Trump's strong opposition to Canada's dairy supply management system. The long-running scheme, which is undeniably protectionist, offers Canadian farmers a guaranteed price for their milk, and puts high tariffs on dairy goods from abroad. Donald Trump has demanded an end to the system, arguing that it is unfair on American farms and shows that Canada has ""disregard"" for its trade obligations. Given that it has already been hit by large US tariffs the Canadian lumber industry is another sector concerned about the details of any new Nafta deal. The US government's complaint is that Canada is improperly subsidising its lumber industry by charging minimal fees to log public lands. This is a longstanding American frustration, and dispute over the issue has flared up repeatedly between the two countries over the past 30 years. In December, the US International Trade Commission ruled that Canadian lumber was being sold in the US at less than a fair price, which had ""materially harmed"" the industry in the US. Canada denies this. Susan Yurkovich, from the British Columbia Lumber Trade Council, says the industry is coping with the tariffs because demand from the US is currently so high. ""[But] if we were in a down market, it would be very different,"" she says. Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz has said that uncertainty over the Nafta deal is weighing on the Canadian economy, with investments being postponed or diverted south of the border.  However, the central bank's spring 2018 report showed a mixed picture among Canadian firms. While some said there were now ""challenges moving staff or goods across the border"", other companies told the bank they were hopeful their American subsidiaries would benefit from US tax cuts, or were optimistic about reaping benefits from strong economic growth in the US over the coming months.  Dan Ciuriak, from the Canadian economic think tank CD Howe Institute, says that trade between the two countries remains strong, but confidence has been ""shaken"" on the Canadian side. Last year trade between the US and Canada in both directions totalled $674bn (£494bn), according to the Office of the US Trade Representative.  Exports of US goods to Canada were 5.9% higher in 2017 than a year earlier, while exports of US services were up 8.8%. Going in the other direction, exports of Canadian goods to the US rose by 8%, while services expanded by 9.5%. To help secure a favourable new Nafta deal, Canada has launched a charm offensive in the US. Mr Trudeau and his cabinet ministers have been beating a path down to Washington and to US states with strong economic ties to Canada.  Marryscott Greenwood, an American who is chief executive of the Canadian American Business Council, a trade body that represents companies on both sides of the border, calls it ""almost a whole of Canada approach"". In addition to the prime minister and his colleagues, she says that provincial premiers, big city mayors, and former prime ministers have all also been making the case to American lawmakers to avoid protectionism and embrace Canada-US trade.  More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade: They are helped by numerous allies in the US who also want a decent new Nafta agreement, such as the US Chamber of Commerce. This powerful lobbying group has called some of Mr Trump's Nafta demands ""highly dangerous"", and have urged the president to protect Nafta's economic benefits.  Pro-trade US Republican governors have called on the president not to withdraw from the deal. Ms Greenwood guesses that Mr Trump does want a new Nafta deal, and that his harsh comments against the existing agreement was a way to ""get people's attention"" and ""forcing people to come to the table"". Until a deal is signed, Canada's steel and aluminium industries are two other sectors of the Canadian economy that remain nervous. They want a new Nafta agreement to give Canada permanent exemptions to US tariffs on metal imports. The issue is particularly pressing in Hamilton, Ontario, the largest steel manufacturing city in Canada, where 10,000 direct jobs depend on the product, and supply chains are heavily integrated with the US and Mexico. Keanin Loomis, president of the Hamilton Chamber of Commerce, was in Washington DC recently, and says he was encouraged at what seemed to be reinvigorated talks. ""We just have no idea how this will end up,"" he says. "
Hawkish,Tech Tent: Looking both back and forward,2024-09-25,2021-10-29,By Rory Cellan-Jones,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-59091146,"This week's Tech Tent has a nostalgic feel. It was recorded in the dim, distant past when Meta was called Facebook and was facing huge reputational problems. We hear from Damian Collins, a long-term critic of Facebook who chaired the UK parliamentary committee which heard from whistleblower Frances Haugen this week.  And we talk to Saurabh Shukla, founder and editor-in-chief of NewsMobile, a third-party fact-checking partner of Facebook in India. He tells us about the challenges of tackling the dangerous misinformation on the social network blamed for inciting racial violence and vaccine hesitancy. Calling Facebook Meta is Mark Zuckerberg's way of telling us his company can shed its troubled past and move into a shiny new virtual world where everything will be awesome. It is of course extremely unlikely that a change of name will suddenly transform the image of the company, and Tech Tent will continue to keep a close eye on Facebook's battle to show that its impact on the real world rather than the metaverse is not as its critics claim. But I won't be part of that as this was my final programme, and I am leaving the BBC. So forgive me if I take a look back at how far Tech Tent has come over nearly 400 editions. It was on 17 January 2014 that we launched a new programme on the BBC World Service with a brief to give listeners a weekly update on all the most important news and trends from the technology business.  We wrestled long and hard over the name and I can't quite remember how we came up with Tech Tent, but it may have been because in its early days the programme came live from a makeshift studio surrounded by a curtain. In that first edition we had something of a scoop - an interview with the tech entrepreneur Tony Fadell, who had sold his Nest thermostat business to Google for what seemed an extraordinary $3.2 billion.  The arrival of the smart home, the progress made in artificial intelligence and the growing concerns about the power and influence of the tech giants, have been constant themes for the programme. Over the years we've broadcast from Las Vegas and Silicon Valley, from Barcelona and Helsinki, from Dundee and on several occasions from the Cheltenham Science Festival. We've had a series of memorable interviews with some leading tech figures. Uber's founder Travis Kalanick did his best to play down his somewhat aggressive image, but when I asked him about reports that he'd been rude about taxi drivers, he suggested I shouldn't get all my facts from the internet. An interview with the physicist Sir Stephen Hawking in 2014 - when he warned that full artificial intelligence could make humans obsolete - helped trigger a global debate on the ethics of AI. And in 2016 an encounter with Elon Musk which had been months in the planning, delivered plenty of memorable quotes. The founder of Tesla and SpaceX told me that we would one day be a multi-planet species. He predicted that within a decade owning a car that you had to drive yourself would be like owning a horse, something you did for sentimental rather than practical reasons. Afterwards, I wrote a blogpost about our encounter, with the headline ""Bonkers but Brilliant"". His PR chief said this was disrespectful, and my attempts to explain that ""bonkers"" was a term of affection in the UK fell on deaf ears. Until March 2020, Tech Tent came live from a studio in London's New Broadcasting House at 3pm every Friday. Then two things happened - the global pandemic arrived, and we were given a new slot in the World Service schedule in the early hours of Friday morning. We quickly adapted to working from home, organising our interviews via Zoom calls and then getting each interviewee to record their end of the conversation using a smartphone, and send us the file. We have recorded the programme at lunchtime each Thursday, and then our masterful producer Jat Gill has spent the afternoon editing it together and uploading it to the BBC's servers from his home near London. If anyone deserves credit for Tech Tent's success and for keeping it on air it is Jat, who has been in charge from the start. We've shared many adventures, working late into the night at CES in Las Vegas and at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.  Jat drove the Tesla which took us to meet Elon Musk, wrenching  back control from the Autopilot system as it tried to follow the white lines off the freeway as we crossed the border between Nevada and California, in a blizzard on a January night. Now Jat too is moving on. But Tech Tent will continue with a new producer, Edwin Lane, and the excellent BBC online technology team. I shall be tuning in next Friday, and so should you."

David and Neil Stevenson, both of Hucknall, Nottinghamshire, bundled the boy into a car in the town on 24 April. Nottingham Crown Court heard they wrongly thought the boy had stolen the scooter from someone in their family. Both admitted kidnapping and received 12-month jail terms, suspended for two years. Police said the boy was driven towards the Bulwell area and repeatedly threatened with violence if he did not tell them where the scooter was. When they realised they had the wrong person, the brothers drove the boy back to Hucknall but again threatened him, warning him they would kill him if he did not find out who stole the scooter, police said. They were tracked down as CCTV recorded the abduction and the registration number of their car. David Stevenson, 51, of The Common, Hucknall, and Neil Stevenson, 41, of Dawlish Close, Hucknall, were each ordered to pay a £187 victim surcharge. Det Con Ryan Lambert, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: ""A child being kidnapped in broad daylight is every parent's worst nightmare and so I am pleased David and Neil Stevenson have been dealt with by the courts. ""By taking the law into their own hands, they put an innocent child through an extremely frightening ordeal - one that will stay with them for a very long time. ""I hope the conclusion of the court proceedings gives the child and their family a sense of closure and that they can now begin to put what happened behind them.""

Hawkish,Hawking legacy 'will live forever',2024-09-25,2018-03-30,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-43582950,"The legacy of Prof Stephen Hawking will live forever, mourners at the theoretical physicist's funeral heard. Prof Hawking, who had motor neurone disease, died on 14 March, aged 76, at his home in Cambridge. Actor Eddie Redmayne was one of several speakers at a service at the university church, Great St Mary's. The professor's eldest son Robert, former student Prof Fay Dowker and Astronomer Royal Martin Rees also gave addresses to the congregation. As the funeral cortege arrived at the church, the bell rang out 76 times - once for each year of Prof Hawking's life. His close family, including his three children Lucy, Robert and Tim, followed behind the hearse carrying the professor's coffin. As it pulled up, the vehicle was met with applause from the hundreds gathered outside the church. An arrangement of white lilies, to represent the universe, and another of white roses representing the polar star was placed on top of his coffin. It was carried into the church by six porters from Gonville and Caius College, where Prof Hawking was a fellow for more than 50 years. The porters, who often assisted him when he visited the college for formal dinners, were asked to be pallbearers by the professor's family. Up to 500 invited family, friends and colleagues attended the private service. Among those inside the church was Eddie Redmayne, who played the role of the professor in the 2014 biographical drama The Theory of Everything. He read from Ecclesiastes 3.1-11, while eulogies were delivered by Robert Hawking and Prof Dowker. The service was officiated by the Reverend Dr Cally Hammond, Dean of Gonville and Caius College. During the service the choir of Gonville and Caius performed the choral work Beyond the Night Sky, which was originally composed as a gift to Prof Hawking for his 75th birthday party at the college last year. Other guests seen arriving at the service were Queen guitarist Brian May and actress Anita Dobson, and television presenter and comedian Dara O Briain.  Entrepreneur Elon Musk and playwright Alan Bennett had also been on the guest list. Stephen shared his work and his zest for the fundamental questions it addressed with wide audiences.  He inspired people with the excitement and importance of pure scientific enquiry and was admired and revered for his devotion, as a scholar, to the pursuit of knowledge. This high regard was demonstrated wherever in the world he gave a public lecture: the auditorium was always packed, the atmosphere electric and the applause thunderous.  Stephen was my teacher, mentor and friend.  I, like many who knew and loved him, had come to think of him as immortal and our sorrow is tinged with a feeling of disbelief that he is no longer here.  But his influence and legacy will live forever. Among the hundreds of people gathered outside the church, many said they had braved the chilly temperature and drizzle to pay their respects to a man they regarded as ""an inspiration"". Cambridge PhD Student Daisy Dixon, 28, said Prof Hawking had been an ""amazing person"". ""It's exciting that someone like that lived in my lifetime,"" the philosophy scholar said. ""It's a very sad day but it's lovely to see everyone here today to pay our respects."" Rod Crozier, who travelled from Boston, Lincolnshire, said: ""He's a very inspirational person... for what he's done in his life and what he's achieved. ""You're never going to see another like him, to be honest."" The funeral was followed by a private reception at Trinity College. A condolence book, which was opened on the morning of Prof Hawking's death, was available to members of the public in the porters' lodge of Gonville and Caius College. A service of thanksgiving for his life will take place at Westminster Abbey in London on 15 June during which time the professor's ashes will be interred next to the grave of Sir Isaac Newton who was buried there in 1727, and close to that of Charles Darwin, who was buried in 1882. The Dean of Westminster, the Very Reverend Dr John Hall, said it was ""entirely fitting"" the professor's final resting place should be ""near those of distinguished fellow scientists""."

The wall at Dawlish, in Devon, is being built after the railway line was destroyed in a storm in 2014. The Town Gateway underpass will temporarily close from 13 June for up to 12 weeks. Bosses said the project would help to ""protect the coastal railway and town from storms and rising sea levels"". The closure is so engineers can install the foundations of a new bridge that will connect the two sections of the promenade. The beach and Kings Walk promenade will remain open to the public. The first section of new sea wall was completed in July 2020 and the construction of the second section began in November 2020. Julie Gregory, Network rail senior sponsor, said: ""I appreciate this closure will be disappointing for the community, especially for people with accessibility needs or those with pushchairs and particularly during the busier summer months. ""However, we will never compromise on the safety of the public or our colleagues, and to ensure we remain on course to complete the second section of sea wall and open the entire promenade and both beaches in September, it is imperative this work is completed now."" Once complete, the new wall will allow people to ""walk along a wider and safer promenade"", Network Rail said. In 2014, a storm destroyed sea defences and the railway line was closed for six weeks.

The UK Coastguard has told people not to handle the Portuguese man-of-war, following an increase in the number appearing along the south coast. It follows a spike in sightings across the Welsh coastline last week. They were reported at Hove, Dawlish, Lyme, Charmouth, Bournemouth, Swanage, Seaton, and Portsmouth over the weekend. Winds picked up over the weekend as Hurricane Ophelia heads towards the British Isles. Speaking to the BBC previously, Dr Peter Richardson of the Marine Conservation Society said that although the man-of-war is a solitary being, they ""they travel in the water whichever way the wind blows"". Its venom, which is used to paralyse its prey, can cause pain to humans and animals, and in very extreme cases death. Aimee Rampton, duty controller for the UK Coastguard said: ""We are aware of these sightings after receiving multiple reports from members of the public. ""Until an accurate identification is made, members of the public are advised to keep away from these jellyfish and report any sighting to the their local council."" The Coastguard said it had also advised the local councils of the recent sightings."
Hawkish,How Sharon Van Etten came undone on her new album,2024-09-25,2022-05-05,By Mark Savage,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-61310451,"When Sharon Van Etten came to London to promote her new album this March, her five-year-old son was worried. ""I was showing him England on the map and he asked if I'd be close to the war,"" she says. ""And I was like, actually that's a really, really good question."" With reassurances given, the singer left the US for the first time since lockdown. But the joy of hitting the road is now tinged with sadness, after two years nesting at home. ""I'm dreading leaving them to go on tour this summer,"" she says. ""I already know I'm going to miss his first day of school. Little things like that, I feel like I'm going to have to get used to."" That struggle is made explicit on her new album, We've Been Going About This All Wrong. At one point, she sings directly to her son: ""I need my job / Please don't hold that against me / You are my life."" ""I put in these little messages that I know he won't quite get now,"" she says, ""but hopefully, years from now, if he resents what I do for a living, he'll listen and be aware that it was hard."" That lyric, like most of her new album, was informed by the harrowing experiences of the last two years. In the era of the lockdown album, Van Etten's record captures that unique mixture of anxiety, liberation, confusion and inertia better than most. ""I'm looking at our grass / I'm struggling for words,"" she sings on the meditative opening track, Darkness Fades. ""It's been a while since I last held you close."" Later, she describes being kept awake at night by thoughts of ""peace and war"" before realising the constant stream of bad news has left her numb.  ""I didn't feel anything... I couldn't feel anything,"" she sings repeatedly over an volcanic wall of sound. ""I had these moments where I thought it was the end of the world and nobody was telling us,"" she explains.  ""When you're so isolated and all you know is your little family unit but you're hearing about protests and tanks being brought in… It felt so far away but it was also in my back yard, so I didn't know how to process it."" Van Etten's music has always dwelt in the darkness, from her 2009 debut, Because I Was in Love, which documented the fall-out of an abusive relationship; to last year's Like I Used To, a raw-nerve duet with Angel Olsen, about emerging from lockdown, that should have been number one in 50 countries. While she isn't a household name, she's revered by her peers, working with Bon Iver, Fiona Apple, The National, and Josh Homme. One of her biggest inspirations, Nick Cave, hand-selected her to open his 2013 tour and Barack Obama named her coming-of-age anthem Seventeen amongst his favourite songs of 2019.   One of her performances even reduced New Zealand broadcaster John Campbell to tears during a live broadcast. Amidst all of that, she's starred in the Netflix drama The OA, and started a bachelor's degree in psychology, with the hope of becoming a mental health counsellor, Oh, and she's also an accomplished sportswoman, with competitive experience in discus and javelin.  ""My mom and I joke that I should have majored in hobbies in High School,"" she laughs, ""because I like to learn how to do stuff but I'm never great at anything. Singing is the farthest I've gone."" Her last album, 2019's Remind Me Tomorrow, brought her dramatic contralto voice to new fans. It helped that the heaviness of her previous records had lifted slightly - joy was now balanced against sorrow, as she settled into the contentedness of a serious relationship with her manager and former drummer, Zeke Hutchins. After their son was born in 2017, the couple planned two major life changes: Moving from New York to Los Angeles, and getting married. The removal men arrived at Van Etten's apartment on the last date of her 2019 tour with Bon Iver; and she went on her bachelorette party a couple of weeks later. ""I remember landing at LAX, coming back from the trip, and saying, 'There's no one at the airport. This is kinda weird. This thing might be serious - maybe it's not like the bird flu,'"" she later confessed to Rolling Stone. And so, she found herself in a new house in a strange neighbourhood, trying to navigate the complexities of lockdown with a toddler. ""We had dance parties, we put a mat on the floor and did gymnastics, he had an easel outside and did painting,"" she recalls. ""At the end of every year I go through our photos to print an album. But that year it was like, 'There's the living room, there's the hallway, there's the yard and that's the TV'."" Although she put on a brave face for her son, her mind was reeling. ""We were living through fires and earthquakes and protests that we couldn't go to because our kid wasn't [eligible to get] vaccinated. We just felt, did we do the wrong thing? Are we in the wrong place? Do we need to be closer to our families?  ""I have my ups and downs like anyone. I'm not perfect. I drink and I sneak cigarettes when I really shouldn't; and I'm supposed to be this positive role model but I'm not perfect. ""But I think I have enough hindsight to be able to call myself out too and be like 'Alright, get it together. You had a moment but you also have to be present for your family. This is a hard time for everyone but this is the time you need to be strong'."" It helped that her new house came with its own recording studio. As Van Etten wrestled with her emotions, new songs started to crystallise.  Some, like Anything, were written in the grip of existential horror. Others crystallise a sense of hope. I'll Try is a swirling, shimmering pledge to do better in a world where dark forces are gathering. ""Protests are just a normal thing [in LA] now,"" she observes. ""When you go for a walk, everyone is holding up a sign. I saw one the other day that said, 'Make science great again', and it's become this everyday thing like, 'I'll pop out and pick up some milk'.  ""It's easy to feel like it doesn't matter. Everything feels like its apocalyptic - but I'm still gonna try."" That resolve is threaded through the record, reflecting Van Etten's desire for connection during the pandemic.   ""I sent out lifelines to people that I hadn't talked to in a while and it definitely relit that flame in our friendship. ""That's a big thing on this record, connection and reaching out and accepting help. Even when it's real hard, those connections help you get through."" So amongst the desolation, there's a refreshing sense of humour on Mistakes (a song about her total lack of co-ordination on the dancefloor); while the album's most tender track, Darkish, offers the comfortingly sarcastic observation: ""It's not dark,,,, It's dark-ish"". The 41-year-old says those moments are a necessary balance. ""I'm very aware that these songs are heavy,"" she says. ""And I get to this place where I think, 'OK, now I need to let the listener breathe.'"" She even toyed with putting a 10-second pause after Born, a song of pulverising sadness, until her manager talked her out of it.  ""He said it was too long,"" she recalls, ""but how long is too long?"" Pauses or not, she wants fans to absorb the album all at once, refusing to release any singles or previews before it hits the shelves this weekend. ""When you hear two or three songs ahead of time, I feel like you lose the excitement of listening to the album front to back,"" she explains. ""I made this music during a time where I felt so vulnerable, like so many, and I want people to feel that with me."" So what does her son make of this new music? A trailer for the album pictured him in Van Etten's home studio, grasping her microphone - so does he ever try to join in? ""He doesn't sing along but he'll play drums,"" she laughs. ""Oh my gosh, he's so good!  ""When we're driving around and I look in the rear-view mirror and he's quietly air drumming. Its like the cutest thing in the world."" Maybe she won't have to miss him on the road for too long. Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts. If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk."
Hawkish,Hawking inspires new 'black hole' 50p coin,2024-09-25,2019-03-12,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-47527505,"Prof Stephen Hawking has been honoured on a new 50p coin inspired by his pioneering work on black holes. The physicist died last year at the age of 76, having become one of the most renowned leaders in his field. He joins an elite group of scientists to have appeared on coins, including Sir Isaac Newton and Charles Darwin. Designer Edwina Ellis said: ""I wanted to fit a big black hole on the tiny coin and wish he was still here chortling at the thought."" She said she wanted to reflect the way he ""made difficult subjects accessible, engaging and relatable"", in particular on black holes. Prof Hawking's daughter Lucy visited the Royal Mint with her brother Tim to see the coins. She said: ""It is a great privilege to be featured on a coin and I hope my father would be pleased to be alongside Sir Isaac Newton and Charles Darwin as scientists who have made it on to money."" Prof Hawking explained black holes in his best-selling book A Brief History Of Time.  He once told the BBC he thought his discovery that black holes were not entirely black would be his ""greatest achievement"". At the age of 22 Prof Hawking was given only a few years to live after being diagnosed with a rare form of motor neurone disease. The illness left him in a wheelchair and largely unable to speak except through a voice synthesiser, but he rose to serve as Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge University for 30 years. After his death on 14 March 2018, crowds lined the streets to bid farewell. People can buy the commemorative coins from the Royal Mint's website, with prices starting at £10 for a brilliant uncirculated version, climbing to £795 for a gold proof coin. Prof Hawking has also been suggested as the new face of the £50 banknote, which will feature a scientist. A decision will be made in the summer."

Hawkish,Rock fall shelter on rail line gets funding,2024-09-25,2021-03-19,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-56457840,"Plans to build a rock fall shelter over a vulnerable stretch of coastal rail line have been given more than £37m in government funding.  The 209m (686ft) shelter extension will be built north of Parsons Tunnel between Dawlish and Holcombe in Devon.  It is hoped it will help keep the rail line connecting the South West with the rest of the country open. Network Rail said the ""critical structure"" will ""protect the railway in Devon for the next 100 years"". The track in south Devon is vulnerable to large waves, as well as rock falls. The main line near Dawlish in Devon collapsed and was washed into the sea during storms in February 2014. The Department for Transport said construction on the shelter is expected to start in August and last for a year. A previous proposal involved moving part of the railway line between Holcombe and Teignmouth further out to sea to avoid cliff falls but those plans have been delayed following a large public response.  Councillor Andrea Davis, Chair of Peninsula Rail Task Force (PRTF), said: ""The line at Dawlish is a vital link between the Peninsula and the rest of the UK and the rock fall shelter is an important element in ensuring people can continue to travel across the peninsula safely and reliably."" She said the line was ""vital to the economic success of the region"" and the shelter was the next phase of the South West Resilience Programme at Dawlish.  Ewen Morrison, from Network Rail's South West Rail Resilience Programme, said: ""This coastal stretch of railway is beautiful but also faces a number of vulnerabilities either side of the railway; rough sea conditions on one side can cause flooding whilst steep cliffs on the other side make the railway at risk of rock falls and landslides."" He added: ""We're looking forward to getting started and are excited by the engineering challenge of building such a critical structure in such an inaccessible location whilst minimising the impact on train services."""
Hawkish,The US stars in search of African identity,2024-09-25,2020-01-06,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-51008291,"African-American rapper and actor Ludacris has become the latest US celebrity to take the nationality of an African country. Ludacris, whose real name is Christopher Brian Bridges, celebrated Christmas and rang in the New Year in Gabon, where he received the citizenship. The rapper's wife Eudoxie Mbouguiengue is Gabonese. A video uploaded on Twitter shows Ludacris with his Gabonese passport and confirming his mother and two daughters also obtained the citizenship of the small, oil-rich Central African nation.  In recent years a number African-American celebrities have received the citizenship of African countries or travelled to Africa to trace their roots. In August 2019, actor and producer Samuel L Jackson also received a Gabonese passport after he was hosted by Ali Bongo, the president of Gabon. His father, Omar Bongo, was in power for more than four decades. Gabon is not the only country welcoming African-Americans as citizens. In May 2019, comedian and actress Tiffany Haddish travelled to Eritrea where she gained the country's citizenship. She was criticised by some for appearing to endorse Eritrea's totalitarian government. And last November, Ghana held a mass ceremony in which 126 African-Americans and Afro-Caribbeans took Ghanaian nationality as part of the country's ""Year of Return"" marking 400 years since the arrival of the first enslaved Africans in North America. The popularity of African Ancestry, a US-based genealogy company with the largest African DNA database, shows that many African-Americans are looking to discover more about their roots and family history. The Trans-Atlantic slave trade, which saw some 12.5 million Africans shipped to the New World, stripped most African slaves of their identity and over the course of 400 years, erased their history.  ""Our ancestors never gave up Faith. You can never imprison our minds nor our spirits. They empowered me to Return,"" Ludacris wrote on Instagram. In one of the photos taken in front of a slave dungeon built by the Europeans in Cape Coast, Ghana, Ludacris has his back turned to the camera, wearing a shirt that says: "" I am not an African because I was born in Africa. I am an African because Africa was born in me. I have returned."" This is a slogan from Ghana's ""Year of Return"" programme.  Samuel L Jackson chose to take Gabonese nationality after taking a DNA test as part of a US documentary series Finding Your Roots that uncovers the family history of stars.  This traced his roots back to the Benga people in Gabon.  The US veteran actor posted several photos of the country, including one with a king of the Benga people. ""When you're on a journey of discovery & a life choice becomes clear!"" he wrote. The government of Ghana launched ""The Year of Return"" to encourage African-Americans and the black Diaspora to return ""home"". ""The arrival of enslaved Africans [in North America] marked a sordid and sad period, when our kith and kin were forcefully taken away from Africa into years of deprivation, humiliation and torture,"" the initiative's official website says. It celebrates ""the cumulative resilience"" of the African victims of the slave trade who were ""scattered and displaced"" across most continents. A number of black stars saw in the New Year in Ghana. Supermodel Naomi Campbell, actress Lupita Nyong'o, musician Akon and pop icon Beyonce's mother Tina Knowles Lawson were among some of the bigger stars to attend the Afrofest celebration. At the mass citizenship ceremony in November, African-American rabbi Kohain Halev summed what it meant to take up the nationality of an African country. ""The most valuable possession that was taken away from us was our identity and our connection; it was like severing the umbilical cord."" He added that receiving a Ghanaian citizenship had mended the hurt: ""Our identity, the dignity, the pride that has been absent is restored here."" Many African-Americans don't feel like they fully belong in the US, according to Dwayne Wong, an author specialising in African and African Diaspora history. Mr Wong believes that centuries of discrimination and being treated as ""second-class citizens"", and the fight for acceptance and recognition that continues to this day in the form of movements like ""Black Lives Matter"", has taught African-Americans that they are not fully American. For some, gaining citizenship of an African country or tracing roots to specific ethnic groups in Africa, can bring an important sense of belonging. "
Hawkish,Ron DeSantis says his Ukraine remarks ‘mischaracterised’,2024-09-25,2023-03-23,By Max Matza,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-65047556,"Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has reportedly sought to clear up his description of the Russia-Ukraine war as a ""territorial dispute"", in the wake of a backlash from fellow Republicans. The widely tipped 2024 White House contender said in a TV interview his remarks had been ""mischaracterised"". He also struck a tougher tone on Vladimir Putin, calling the Russian president a ""war criminal"". Recent opinion polls suggest Mr Trump has been gaining over Mr DeSantis. The former president has been launching a sustained attack in recent weeks against his onetime political protege. Mr DeSantis has kept tight-lipped on his rumoured plans to challenge Mr Trump for the Republican White House nomination. Speaking to Piers Morgan Uncensored, the Florida governor was asked about his description earlier this month of the Russia-Ukraine war as a ""territorial dispute"".  ""Well, I think it's been mischaracterised,"" he said, according to a preview of the interview, which airs on Thursday.  The Florida governor - who won a landslide re-election last year - said his comment had referred only to the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine and the occupied Crimean peninsula.  ""There's a lot of ethnic Russians there,"" the 44-year-old continued. ""So, that's some difficult fighting and that's what I was referring to.""  ""It wasn't that I thought Russia had a right to that,"" Mr DeSantis added, calling the notion that Moscow was justified in its attack ""nonsense"". ""If I could snap my fingers, I'd give it back to Ukraine 100%,"" the former congressman and ex-US Navy lawyer continued. His ""territorial dispute"" remark prompted Ukraine to issue the governor an invitation to visit the war-torn country. While the comment seemed to align the Florida governor with Mr Trump, who has opposed US support for Kyiv, it provoked criticism from hawkish Republican senators Marco Rubio and Lindsey Graham, drawing battle lines between the isolationist and establishment wings of the party. On Wednesday, Mr Trump said on his Truth Social platform that Mr DeSantis had ""crashed"" in the polls, dismissing him as an ""average governor"". A Monmouth University opinion poll released on Tuesday indicated Mr Trump had a double-digit lead in the Republican primary contest, reversing Mr DeSantis' recent gains."

Hawkish,Two gulls shot dead in 'senseless' airgun attack,2024-09-25,2022-06-18,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-somerset-61852243,"Two herring gulls have died following an airgun attack which the RSPCA has described as ""completely senseless"". The injured birds were discovered in the gardens of two properties in Friarn Avenue in Bridgwater.  One was already dead while the second was so badly injured it had to be put to sleep to prevent further suffering. RSPCA animal rescue officer, Alison Sparks, said: ""It beggars belief that people are callously targeting animals in this way."" X-rays taken at the RSPCA's West Hatch Wildlife Centre in Taunton confirmed that both of the birds had been shot with an airgun, with pellets clearly visible on the scans.    One of the birds was shot in the wing, while the other had a wound to the upper chest area. Gulls, their eggs and their nests, are protected by law and it is illegal to intentionally kill, take or injure them, except under licence. Ms Sparkes, who attended on Monday night, said: ""Both birds appear to have been deliberately shot and sustained horrible injuries as a result.  ""Sadly, completely senseless attacks like this are not an uncommon occurrence for RSPCA officers. Finding animals who have been subjected to cruelty like this is upsetting. ""It's very worrying that people are taking pot-shots at birds like this in a residential area, and I would urge anyone with information to contact the RSPCA.""  Last year the RSPCA received 454 calls about animals being shot, injured or killed with air guns, although the charity believes these numbers do not show the full extent of the problem. The charity said it wants to see stricter regulations around owning an air weapon in both England and Wales. Follow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Hawkish,Traditional falconry returning to Stonehenge,2024-09-25,2020-08-28,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-wiltshire-53947810,"Falconry is returning to Stonehenge over the bank holiday with displays at the historic landmark and other notable sites around the country.  English Heritage is reviving the tradition with similar events at Dover Castle and Eltham Palace in London. The charity said Salisbury Plain had long been a venue for traditional hawking. Stonehenge was an important landmark in Victorian times for those who hunted and coursed in the area, it added. Head of historic properties Jenny Davies said she was ""delighted"" to bring back falconry in the charity's first series of events since the lockdown.  ""Although we haven't been able to host our usual [summer] programme across the country due to coronavirus restrictions, falconry lends itself really well to social distancing, as the whole sky is the stage,"" she added. During the 19th Century, Salisbury Plain was a hawking ground for the Old Hawking Club. Exercises were first conducted on the plain in 1898 and local garrison town Larkhill was so named due to an abundance of skylarks, making it attractive to falconers.  From 1900, the rapid spread of Army camps, rifle ranges and barbed wire restricted the activities of the club. However, they continued to hawk where they could in the landscape and parishes surrounding Stonehenge. For more information about the event, visit the English Heritage website."
Hawkish,Could Russia really play nuclear roulette in Ukraine?,2024-09-25,2023-06-21,By Steve Rosenberg,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-65976256,"It's the question we've been asking ever since President Vladimir Putin ordered the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine. In this war, would the Kremlin go nuclear? President Joe Biden isn't ruling it out. ""I worry about Putin using tactical nuclear weapons,"" the US president said this week. He believes the danger is ""real"". I don't know whether President Biden reads the Russian magazine Profile. If he does, you can understand why he's worried.  Last week, Profile published an article by prominent Russian foreign and defence policy expert Sergei Karaganov. The hawkish Mr Karaganov is honorary chairman of the Presidium of the Council on Foreign and Defence Policy. In short, he's well-connected to those in power here. His argument goes like this. In order to ""break the West's will"", Russia ""will have to make nuclear deterrence a convincing argument again by lowering the threshold for the use of nuclear weapons"". ""The enemy must know that we are ready to deliver a pre-emptive strike in retaliation for all of its current and past acts of aggression in order to prevent a slide into global thermonuclear war. ""But what if they do not back down? In this case, we will have to hit a bunch of targets in a number of countries in order to bring those who have lost their mind to reason."" Since last year, we've grown used to nuclear sabre-rattling from Moscow.  And President Putin has confirmed that Russia has already stationed a first batch of tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, a move the Russian leader says is designed to remind anyone ""thinking of inflicting a strategic defeat on us"". But arguing the pluses of a pre-emptive nuclear strike on the West? That's a whole new level. Clearly, not everyone in Russia is on board with such an idea. Today's edition of the business daily Kommersant features an article entitled ""Nuclear War is a bad way of resolving problems"". Understatement of all time, maybe. But what's fascinating about this piece is that it suggests the debate in Russia about when or whether to use nuclear weapons in the war in Ukraine has burst into the public domain. And the hawks don't have it all their way.  Penned by another group of Moscow-based foreign and defence policy experts, the Kommersant article explains why they believe Sergei Karaganov has got it wrong. Dangerously wrong.  ""The idea that the use of nuclear weapons can halt escalation and resolve strategic problems that conventional military means have failed to is extremely dubious and, most likely, mistaken,"" write Alexei Arbatov, Konstantin Bogdanov and Dmitry Stefanovich from the Centre for International Security - part of a think tank within the Russian Academy of Science.  ""In modern history, there are many examples of military operations leading to unforeseen consequences. But these were without nuclear weapons being used. A nuclear strike would raise the conflict to a whole new level of unpredictability and raise the stakes of confrontation many times over. ""The radioactive ruins that playing 'nuclear roulette' would most likely lead to are the worst foundation for a bright future. Fans of sensationalist ideas and dangerous gambling would be best to remember that."" Which brings us to another question we've been asking since the start of Russia's war in Ukraine: what on Earth is going on?  It's possible that Mr Karaganov's proposal for a pre-emptive nuclear strike was so shocking that other Russian academics felt they just couldn't stay silent. If so, it shows that although the Russian media landscape is now heavily controlled by the state, even within current confines, there is still room on some platforms for limited debate and discussion on certain topics. Especially such crucial topics as nuclear war. Or it may be that this whole debate is designed to grab the West's attention, to make President Putin look like good cop to Mr Karaganov's bad cop.  After all, the Kremlin leader himself hasn't called for a pre-emptive nuclear strike on the West. And so - the argument goes - better sit down and make peace with him, before hardliner Karaganovites win the day and press the nuclear button. One thing's clear: with anti-Western rhetoric in Russia rising, and with the Ukrainian army's counter-offensive under way, the nuclear question isn't going away. "

Hawkish,Where's Europe's leadership in Russia's war?,2024-09-25,2022-06-22,By Katya Adler,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61904360,"Ukrainians are fighting and dying, while Lithuania has just been directly threatened by Russia.  Germans are talking up energy rationing ahead of winter and the UN is warning of a global food crisis because of Russia's Black Sea blockade, impeding Ukraine's crucial grain exports. We're slap bang in the middle of a European security crisis - fast becoming a global one. And EU leadership is noticeably lacking. Over the next week alone, there's an EU summit in Brussels, a meeting of the G7 world's richest nations in Germany and a huge Nato defence alliance summit in Madrid. But where is that convincing European figure, able to speak on behalf of all the bloc's leaders? Angela Merkel, Germany's famous former chancellor, was far from perfect. For starters, Russia's dominance and leverage over EU energy supplies were things she was at least partially responsible for.  But she was a good crisis manager with a canny ability to knock (EU leaders') heads together when necessary to find a way forward. Think of the Greek debt crisis or the tail end of the migrant crisis, for example.  And now? Olaf Scholz, her successor as head of the EU's richest nation, has failed spectacularly to take the lead in the crisis over Ukraine. He has implemented huge change at home, pledging to modernise and invest in Germany's military for the first time since the end of the Second World War. Considering long-standing sensitivities back home, that is no mean feat.  But look at his dismal popularity ratings in Germany or ask his colleagues in Europe: Mr Scholz has not grabbed the moment.  Instead, he has given the impression, since Russia began its invasion, of being very much on the back foot - when it comes to weapons deliveries to Ukraine, to name but one example.  And what of France, the EU's other traditional leading country? Emmanuel Macron cherished the hope, when Angela Merkel exited politics stage right last autumn, that the crown of ""de facto"" EU leader would then be his.  But even before his drubbing in last weekend's parliamentary elections in France, Mr Macron was not a trusted figure in Brussels. Many (particularly those geographically closer to Russia, such as Poland and the Baltic countries) suspect him of being too soft on the Kremlin.  Hackles were raised recently when he spoke of the need not to humiliate Russian President Vladimir Putin in order to maintain the possibility of a diplomatic solution to the conflict in Ukraine. They, the countries with shared geography and a history with Russia, are ""new"" EU leading powers, emerging as a direct result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  Poland's voice, along with the three Baltic states, has been getting increasingly loud in Brussels - and within the Nato defence alliance too.  They feel vindicated after years of warning the West not to ""sleepwalk"" into a security crisis with the Kremlin and their viewpoints are now being heard with more respect.  In this cacophony of EU voices on Ukraine, we can't omit Hungary. Its freshly re-elected and even more self-confident Prime Minister, Victor Orban, has played a prominent role as a thorn in the side of the EU in the current crisis.  He held up, and succeeded in watering down, the most recent sanctions package, which included a strategically important phased embargo on Russian oil.  Sanctions, like all foreign policy decisions in the EU, need to be agreed unanimously amongst the 27 member countries. And despite the severity of the current crisis, no other European leader was able to persuade Budapest to step in line with the rest. This is not to suggest EU is falling apart over Ukraine. At this week's Brussels summit, EU leaders plan to announce a joint decision to offer Ukraine candidacy status (a largely symbolic move, allowing the country to start the long process of applying for EU membership).  EU leaders will also repeat their pledge to help Ukraine economically and militarily. But the longer Moscow's military onslaught continues, the harder it is becoming to maintain unity of purpose inside the EU and the wider Western coalition. There are splits, for example, over what Ukraine's war aims should be.  Western powers agree Russia must be seen to have failed in Ukraine. But what does that mean in practice?  Officially, of course, allies say it's up to Ukraine to decide its own military objectives. But Western weapons deliveries (how much and what types of weapons) will be key in influencing what action the Ukrainian military can take. Again, countries physically closer to Russia (the Baltics, Poland and much of former communist central Europe too) are more ""hawkish"" in their attitudes.  Estonia's prime minister told me that if Ukraine were forced to make territorial concessions in order to reach a ceasefire, far from appeasing Moscow, it would mean the Kremlin would come back for more. There's a feeling that Russia must be taught a lesson.  These EU countries feel far more aligned in their thinking with the UK, where Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Foreign Secretary Liz Truss have been very outspoken about Russia, than with traditional EU powers Germany, France and Italy. Berlin, Paris and Rome, by contrast, are concentrating on an end to hostilities in Ukraine. Not at any price, of course. The support for Ukraine and its military is genuine.  But many leaders in Western Europe have domestic opinion polls on their mind. Voters worry about the conflict in Ukraine spreading and taking on a nuclear dimension.  Rising food and fuel prices, resulting from the war, are cause for concern too. Leaders in Western Europe also fret about the potential for a new migrant crisis, if people in the Middle East and Africa end up fleeing hunger provoked by Russia preventing sea exports of Ukrainian grain. The US is trying to straddle these contrasting views, hoping to keep a Western coalition together. Its long-term view is that we're in a new Cold War. And the US needs Europe to counter China with Russia by its side (as long as it suits those powers to work that way). Washington has been keen to encourage support in Asia too. Japan and South Korea have been invited as observers to the big Nato summit in Madrid next week, as have Australia and New Zealand. An alliance of Western-style democracies is how it's portrayed. And the EU is very much part of this alliance. However, its dream of becoming a key political, as well as economic, player will come to little if the bloc continues to muddle through, lacking decisive leadership."
Hawkish,Protesters call for minor injuries unit to reopen,2024-09-25,2021-07-24,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-57954145,"Campaigners have held a demonstration calling for the reopening of a minor injuries unit (MIU). The Totnes and Dawlish MIUs closed in March 2020 due to staffing shortages and Covid-19, said Torbay and South Devon NHS Foundation Trust. Town councillor David Matthews, who joined the protest at the former MIU, said the closure put people ""in danger"". The trust said it hoped the Totnes unit could reopen in October. The nearest MIU for Totnes residents is at Newton Abbot, about eight miles away. ""The closure of both MIUs has put a lot of people in danger,"" said Mr Matthews. ""It's no fun at all if you're nursing a serious bite or an injured child all the way to Newton Abbot. ""And closing the MIU becomes an excuse to close the hospital."" It had been a ""challenge"" to recruit staff in a ""highly competitive market"", said a trust spokesperson. ""Unfortunately, we cannot confirm an exact reopening date for Totnes Minor Injuries Unit at this moment but we are actively doing all that is possible to support its reopening.

Shaun Powney, 51, pleaded guilty at Exeter Crown Court to the manslaughter of Patrick Powney in Plymouth in February on the grounds of diminished responsibility. Prosecutors dropped a murder charge after accepting Powney was suffering from a mental illness at the time. He was remanded to doctors' care in Langdon Hospital in Dawlish, and will be sentenced after psychiatric reports. Patrick Powney was found by police at his son's address on 18 February after officers were called to check on the welfare of the occupants.  He was later declared dead in hospital, the court heard. Judge Peter Johnson said the psychiatric reports for Powney, of Shelley Way, Plymouth, were ordered ""to assess your culpability insofar as this incident was concerned"". The judge said three psychiatrists were ""going to be instructed to form opinions on that"". Ignatius Hughes QC, defending, agreed reports were needed to assess where the case fell within guidelines that governed any sentencing of diminished responsibility manslaughter cases.

Devon County Council said ""treacherous"" conditions had made many roads impassable and feared motorists getting stuck would hamper its clear-up. The village of Lynton on the Exmoor coast has been cut off from surrounding roads because of snowdrifts up to 3m (9ft) deep. There are also eight flood warnings in place across Devon and Cornwall. Councillor Stuart Hughes, cabinet member for highways, said: ""There are a lot of little communities across Dartmoor and Exmoor and they really need to get back on the gritted network. ""If you get stuck in your car you will make the situation even worse. ""So our message is, 'Let our crews do the work and we can start getting Devon back to normal again'."" A video posted by Sgt Dave Thubron from Devon and Cornwall Police shows snow covering the roads to and from Exmoor in the Parracombe and Lynton areas. On lower ground, engineers are assessing the damage to a main road between Torcross and Dartmouth. The tarmac was destroyed when huge waves combined with a spring high tide to batter the road on Friday. Mr Hughes said: ""Let's keep our fingers crossed that we can find the money to get that road re-opened with some temporary measures and then look to the long-term future of the road, because it is vitally important to those communities."" In other weather-related disruption: Sharon Critchlow, of Horns Cross near Bideford in Devon, has been without water since 16:00 GMT on Friday.  She said: ""The South West Water website said four to six hours to get it back on - but we still have no water.""

Hawkish,Christmas gifts for 700 staff on anchored ships,2024-09-25,2020-12-17,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-55279474,"Staff on cruise ships anchored off the coast of Devon are receiving festive hampers from the local community. Due to Covid-19 the ships have been anchored off Torbay for several months.  On Christmas Day, there will be six ships offshore with about 700 members of staff on them. Organiser Louise Lewis said they had become part of the community, with the hampers full of sweet treats, decorations and small gifts a way to spread ""Christmas spirit"". The pandemic has stopped the cruise ships from operating, although they still require staff on board to keep them running. The idea of sending them hampers started with a few friends on a group chat, but has since grown, with people from Brixham, Paignton, Dawlish, Teignmouth, Torquay and Guernsey all getting involved. ""Because the cruise ships have been here so long, they're just part of the community,"" said Ms Lewis. ""It's all about the true meaning and spirit of Christmas, letting these people know that we're thinking of them."" About eight large boxes of gifts are being sent to each cruise ship, with the tenders usually used to ferry passengers to shore being repurposed as delivery vessels. As well as gifts, the crews will receive Christmas cards from local primary schools.  Ms Lewis originally contacted the ships two months ago, to encourage them all to ""blow their horns"" on Remembrance Day. ""I'd also heard that the staff had been donating surplus food to local food banks, so I thought it would be really nice to give them something back,"" she said Carnival, which owns several of the cruise ships, said the gifts were ""the most lovely gesture from the local community and a very thoughtful way to spread some festive cheer"".  ""It is hugely appreciated by all of those on board who can't wait to get back to sailing and giving guests wonderful holidays, but for now will enjoy the festive season with all the usual trimmings, activities and celebrations on board."""

But when the 43-year-old Cardiff-born star took to the stage in Los Angeles on Monday night to accept his award, his speech came as something of a surprise to his legions of fans. ""His accent! I had no idea! #LoveIt #Welsh"" said one Twitter fan. Not everyone got it right.  ""I didn't realise after all this time... that #MatthewRhys was SCOTTISH."" The hashtag #MatthewRhys began trending on Twitter following his win. Many followers expressed surprise at hearing the Welshman's native tones, and admiration for his mastery of the American accent. One commented: ""Holy accent. He should win awards just for playing Americans so well!"" Rhys, who played the role of KGB deep-cover agent Philip Jennings from 2013 to 2018, won best leading actor in a drama series. His on-screen wife and real-life partner, Keri Russell, was also nominated for her role in the show but did not win. Rhys paid tribute to her during his acceptance speech, and also referenced an earlier on-stage proposal by a director. He gave thanks ""to the woman who truly got me this award, who just stands in front of me every day and just puts up with me"". He told the audience: ""She said, 'if you propose to me I will punch you clean in the mouth'."" Rhys's sister Rachel Evans, a television series producer, called the award ""great news"". ""He's been the bridesmaid but never the bride these past three years. We're so proud of him. It's a great achievement,"" she said. ""He's had a lot of investment in the series over the last six years. He's really believed in it."" She woke up just before the award was announced in time to watch social media explode in reaction to the news. ""I texted Matthew at about 6am [UK time] and he said he was drinking warm beer and eating cold pizza,"" she added. Rhys was accompanied to the awards by his cousin Elain Edwards, who works as his make-up artist and hair stylist. She told BBC Wales: ""He flew in by private jet, and I was waiting for him. I prepared him before the ceremony. ""We are thrilled that he won, because he's been nominated before... it's nice that he's been recognised."" ""He was telling me beforehand how nervous he was and that he wanted to win, but was a bit scared regarding his speech if his name was announced."""
Hawkish,Australia denies lying to France in submarine deal,2024-09-25,2021-09-19,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-58616759,"Australia has defended its decision to scrap a multi-billion dollar submarine purchase from France in favour of a new security pact with the US and UK.  Prime Minister Scott Morrison rejected accusations that Australia had lied, saying France should have been aware it was prepared to break the deal.  France says the Aukus pact has led to a ""serious crisis"" between the allies. In an unprecedented move, it has recalled its ambassadors from the US and Australia as a sign of protest.  Under the Aukus pact, Australia will be given the technology to build nuclear-powered submarines as a way of countering China's influence in the contested South China Sea.  The partnership has ended a deal worth $37bn (£27bn) signed by Australia in 2016 for France to build 12 conventional submarines. France says it was informed of the pact only hours before the public announcement was made earlier this week.  Mr Morrison on Sunday said he understood France's disappointment, but that he had always been clear about Australia's position.  The French government ""would have had every reason to know that we had deep and grave concerns"", he said.  ""Ultimately this was a decision about whether the submarines that were being built, at great cost to the Australian taxpayer, were going to be able to do a job that we needed it to do when they went into service and our strategic judgment based on the best possible of intelligence and defence advice was that it would not."" Mr Morrison's comments came after French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told France 2 television there had been ""lying, duplicity, a major breach of trust and contempt"" over the deal. He said France's ambassadors to the US and Australia were being recalled to ""re-evaluate the situation"", but that there had been ""no need"" to recall the ambassador to the UK, which he described as a ""third wheel"".  US President Joe Biden is expected to hold talks with his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron in the coming days.  ""We want explanations,"" French government spokesman Gabriel Attal said on Sunday. Meanwhile, newly appointed UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss defended the agreement in an article for The Sunday Telegraph, saying it showed Britain's readiness to be ""hard-headed"" in defence of its interests. The pact means Australia will become just the seventh nation in the world to operate nuclear-powered submarines. It will also see the allies share cyber capabilities, artificial intelligence and other undersea technologies. China has accused the three powers involved in the security pact of having a ""Cold War mentality"". Clumsy diplomacy, heightened emotions and spy-like secrecy: the row over the new security pact between the UK, the US and Australia has it all.  But amid the increasingly shrill invective from humiliated French ministers, there is a fundamental truth: the West is struggling to make up its mind about China. Washington has now been joined by Canberra and London in acting together to address the security challenge. Other countries - particularly some in Europe - are less hawkish, still trying to split the difference between economic cooperation and strategic competition with Beijing.  France is furious at the breach of contract by Australia and the lack of trust shown by the US and the UK. So there is talk in the French papers of further retaliation, beyond the recall of ambassadors, perhaps involving Nato. Others are speculating this row might finally encourage Europe to agree some greater strategic autonomy.  The truth is more straightforward: if the West wishes to protect its interests in the Indo-Pacific, then France and other European powers need to be on the same page as the US and its Anglophone allies. And right now both sides are not even reading the same book. "
Hawkish,Tributes paid to 'inspirational' Hawking,2024-09-25,2018-03-14,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-43398187,"Scientists, politicians and actors have paid tribute to world renowned physicist Stephen Hawking, who has been called an ""inspiration to millions"". The British scientist, famed for his work on black holes, died peacefully at his home in Cambridge aged 76. Astronomer Royal Lord Rees, one of the world's most eminent scientists, described his life as a ""triumph"". Others described him as a ""unique individual"" whose death ""has left an intellectual vacuum in his wake"". Prof Hawking was diagnosed with a rare form of motor neurone disease at the age of 21 and was told he had only a few years to live. He was known for his theories on black holes and relativity and went on to publish several popular science books including A Brief History of Time. The University of Cambridge, where Prof Hawking completed his PhD and went on to become Lucasian Professor of Mathematics - a role once held by Sir Isaac Newton - described him as ""an inspiration to millions"". Queues have formed at Gonville and Caius College - where Prof Hawking was a fellow for more than 50 years - to sign a book of condolence. Buckingham Palace said the Queen will be sending a message of condolence to Prof Hawking's family. Prof Hawking's children, Lucy, Robert and Tim, said in a statement: ""His courage and persistence with his brilliance and humour inspired people across the world. ""He once said, 'It would not be much of a universe if it wasn't home to the people you love'. We will miss him forever."" Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, broadcaster Prof Brian Cox called him ""one of the greats"" and said physicists in 1,000 years' time ""will still be talking about Hawking radiation"", his theory about black holes. British astronaut Tim Peake, who flew in space in 2016, said Prof Hawking ""inspired generations to look beyond our own blue planet and expand our understanding of the universe"". And the inventor of the World Wide Web, Sir Tim Berners-Lee, praised Prof Hawking's ""colossal mind and wonderful spirit"". Many friends and fans have also hailed his humour, with actor Eddie Redmayne, who portrayed Prof Hawking in 2014 film biopic The Theory of Everything, calling him ""the funniest man I have ever met"". Fellow actor Benedict Cumberbatch, who also played the physicist in a 2004 BBC TV film, remembered his ""wickedly funny sense of humour"". ""He virtually created the publishing genre of popular science. I will miss our margaritas but will raise one to the stars to celebrate your life,"" he added.  Meanwhile, Lord Rees - who holds the most prestigious post in astronomy in the UK - recalled meeting Prof Hawking at Cambridge University in 1964, describing him as ""unsteady on his feet and speaking with great difficulty"" following his diagnosis with the degenerative disease. ""Even mere survival would have been a medical marvel, but of course he didn't just survive.  He became one of the most famous scientists in the world,"" Lord Rees said ""He was diagnosed with a deadly disease, and his expectations dropped to zero. He himself said that everything that happened since then was a bonus."" ""And what a triumph his life has been,"" Lord Rees added. Prime Minister Theresa May opened PMQs with a nod to Prof Hawking's ""exceptional contributions to science and our knowledge of the universe speak for themselves"".  ""As his children have said, his courage and persistence with his brilliance and humour inspired people across the world,"" she said. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn also paid tribute to the physicist - who was a Labour supporter - and said he ""inspired the world with his determination to explain the mysteries of the cosmos"" and ""showed breathtaking courage to overcome life's adversities"".  Former US President Barack Obama, who Prof Hawking met in 2009 to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom, tweeted a photo of them both alongside the words: ""Have fun out there among the stars"". Meanwhile, from the worlds of science, technology and space, Nasa said Prof Hawking's theories ""unlocked a universe of possibilities"". American astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson tweeted: ""His passing has left an intellectual vacuum in his wake"" while George Smoot, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics, described Prof Hawking as ""very competitive"". Meanwhile, Professor Stephen Toope, vice-chancellor of the University of Cambridge said Prof Hawking has left ""an indelible legacy"". ""Prof Hawking was a unique individual who will be remembered with warmth and affection not only in Cambridge but all over the world,"" he said. ""He will be much missed."" Celebrities including Sam Smith, Nancy Sinatra and Janelle Monáe also shared tributes. Cher recalled meeting Prof Hawking for lunch and discussing history while Katy Perry said: ""There's a big black hole in my heart"". Comedian Dara O'Briain, who has a degree in mathematics and theoretical physics and is also the presenter of the BBC's Stargazing Live, called Prof Hawking ""a hero of mine"". He said: ""What a privilege it was to know Stephen Hawking. He was a triumph of what we, as humans, can achieve."" Meanwhile, neuroscientist and The Big Bang Theory actress Mayim Bialik, who met with Prof Hawking when he starred in the series, shared a photo of him and the cast. She described him as ""the greatest physicist of our era"" while the show itself thanked him ""for inspiring us and the world"". Many people have praised Prof Hawking's contribution to popular culture, with Oxford University biologist Sally Le Page remarking he was ""as much as a cultural icon as a scientific one"". According to online retailer Amazon, Prof Hawking's book A Brief History of Time has risen to the top of its best sellers list following the announcement of his death on Wednesday. The Royal Albert Hall said the ""genius"" Prof Hawking was the second physicist, after Albert Einstein in 1933, to ever sell out the venue with his lecture in 1995. The Motor Neurone Disease Association said Prof Hawking ""played a vital role"" in raising awareness of the disease, which kills more than half of people within two years of diagnosis. The charity said it had seen such an ""influx of donations"" following the announcement of Prof Hawking's death that its website had crashed."
Hawkish,News Daily: Stephen Hawking dies and Putin misses May's deadline,2024-09-25,2018-03-14,By Justin Parkinson,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-43393575,"Hello. Here's your morning briefing: The British physicist Stephen Hawking, world-renowned for his work on black holes and relativity, has died at the age of 76. For 54 years he lived with a rare form of motor neurone disease, which left him in a wheelchair and unable to speak except through a voice synthesiser. When first diagnosed, he was given only a few years to live. But Prof Hawking became famous beyond science, appearing in many TV shows and having his life story portrayed on film and TV. His book, A Brief History of Time, sold more than 10 million copies. His family paid tribute to ""an extraordinary man whose work and legacy will live on for many years"". Here is the story of Stephen Hawking's incredible life. Vladimir Putin has not responded to Theresa May's midnight deadline for an explanation over the poisoning of a former Russian spy and his daughter in Salisbury.

Hawkish,Foo Fighters' drummer Taylor Hawkins dies aged 50,2024-09-25,2022-03-26,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-60884259,"The drummer with US rock group Foo Fighters, Taylor Hawkins, has died aged 50, the band have announced. The band said they were ""devastated by the tragic and untimely loss"" in a statement on social media. No cause of death has been given. Hawkins played with Foo Fighters for more than two decades, joining shortly after they finished making their 1997 album The Colour and the Shape. The band are currently on tour in South America.  ""His musical spirit and infectious laughter will live with us forever,"" Foo Fighters wrote. ""Our hearts go out to his wife, children, and family, and we ask that their privacy be treated with the utmost respect in this unimaginably difficult time."" Foo Fighters were formed in 1994 by Dave Grohl, after his previous group Nirvana disbanded following the suicide of lead singer Kurt Cobain.  While Grohl drummed for Nirvana, he took on lead vocals and guitar in Foo Fighters, and so Hawkins had the daunting task of drumming in a group founded by one of the most celebrated drummers in rock. ""I was a little nervous at first, but I got over that,"" he told OC Weekly soon after joining.   ""Any instance where you're auditioning for something, you're going to be nervous. But no-one can play better than Dave Grohl. He just has this vision in his head."" The two sometimes swapped roles during the band's concerts, with Hawkins taking on vocals. After news of his death was announced many fans shared clips of him singing Queen's Somebody to Love. Before joining Foo Fighters, Hawkins drummed for Alanis Morissette.  While visiting London in 2001, he took an overdose of heroin and spent two weeks in a coma. Speaking about the experience in 2018, he said it had been ""a real changing point for me"". The band had been due to perform on Friday night at the Estereo Picnic festival in Bogota, Colombia. The US embassy in Bogota expressed its ""sincerest condolences"" to the drummer's family, friends and fans.  Beatriz De La Pava from BBC Minute was backstage at the festival when the announcement of Taylor Hawkins' death was made to the crowd. ""While we were backstage, I saw the Foo Fighters team was packing up everything,"" she said. ""The organisers of the festival arrived and then they all went on to the stage after Nile Rodgers had finished and said they had some very sad news to share.  ""A message was then published on the big screens that Taylor had died and everyone was silent. A few of the other stages started playing My Hero by the Foo Fighters.  ""They placed candles on the stage where the Foo Fighters were supposed to play. A lot of people were crying and some DJs who were supposed to play sets cancelled, although people just wanted more and more Foo Fighters music."" If you're going to play drums for Dave Grohl, one of the best players in the history of rock, you'd better be good. Taylor Hawkins was that good. He could pulverise the kit on The Pretender, play it like a song on Learn To Fly or add a funky shuffle to a track like Shame Shame. He was more than just Grohl's equal, he was his partner in crime. The star once said Hawkins was ""overly qualified"" for his band. He wasn't just the time-keeper. He had writing credits on Grammy-winning hits like Best Of You, Learn To Fly and All My Life; and at almost every Foo Fighters concert, he'd step out from behind the kit and sing a track by his favourite band, Queen.  At his last show, a week ago in Argentina, that song was Somebody To Love. Born in Texas but raised in California, Hawkins had the affable, easy-going demeanour of a surfer dude. He was introduced to music by his brother and started out playing guitar but, inspired by Roger Taylor of Queen and Stewart Copeland of The Police, he soon switched to drums.  At the age of 10, he sat behind a ""rickety-rackety"" kit for the first time in his neighbour's garage. ""And then,"" he said, ""my life became drums, drums, drums."" He first rose to prominence in Alanis Morissette's touring band and joined Foo Fighters in 1997, after a studio dispute led to the departure of original drummer, William Goldsmith. Although he was ""super-intimidated"", he slotted right into the band. In his autobiography, Grohl called their partnership ""a kind of love at first sight"". ""Upon first meeting, our bond was immediate and we grew closer with every day, every song, every note that we ever played together,"" he wrote. ""We are absolutely meant to be and I am grateful that we found each other in this lifetime."" Hawkins' death at the age of 50 is devastating - for Grohl, his bandmates and his fans, but most of all, his wife Alison and their three children. Rest in beats. Paying tribute, Tom Morello, of fellow rockers Rage Against the Machine, tweeted: ""God bless you Taylor Hawkins. I loved your spirit and your unstoppable rock power. Rest In Peace my friend."" Ozzy Osbourne said Hawkins was ""truly a great person and an amazing musician"". Miley Cyrus, who was part of the festival line-up, said she would dedicate her Saturday show to Hawkins. ""My favorite memory of Taylor is dancing round the drum kit while he played this song..."" she posted on Instagram, with a picture of the Pretenders song Brass In Pocket. ""Playing it on repeat, imagining us laughing forever."" Former Beatles drummer Ringo Starr also expressed his condolences. ""God bless Taylor,"" he wrote. ""Peace and love to all his family and the band peace and love."" Kiss member Gene Simmons said he was ""shocked and saddened"" by the news of Hawkins' death. Billy Idol shared a picture of Hawkins on Twitter with the words: ""So tragic. Rest in peace Taylor."" Other bands paying tribute to the Foo Fighters drummer included the Smashing Pumpkins, Nickelback and the Offspring."
Hawkish,Prevention zone after further bird flu cases,2024-09-25,2020-11-11,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-gloucestershire-54911712,"An outbreak of bird flu has been confirmed in Herefordshire, officials say, as a prevention zone is declared across England. The Avian Influenza Prevention Zone (AIPZ) aims to mitigate the spread of the disease after other outbreaks of the ""highly pathogenic"" H5N8 strain in Gloucestershire, Dorset and Devon.  Bird keepers must now follow strict bio-security measures, Defra said. A separate control zone has now been introduced in Herefordshire. The latest case has been identified at a broiler breeder farm south of Leominster, Defra said. The 1.8m (3km) and 6.2m (10km) zone means restrictions are now in place around the movement of birds, how they are kept and visits made to the farm. However, all of the birds on the site will be humanely culled to reduce the risk of the disease spreading. By David Gregory-Kumar, BBC science, environment and rural affairs correspondent Poultry farmers feared this was coming, but still this is bad news for the industry.  The outbreak in Leominster is the third at a commercial poultry farm in the last 10 days. With avian flu also moving through farms in Europe and the discovery of the virus in wild birds in Gloucestershire, farmers and anyone with poultry is being asked to remain alert and make sure they obey strict bio-security rules.  If anyone sees dead wild birds like swans, geese, ducks, gulls or even birds of prey, they should report them to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). Those with free range turkeys in areas with outbreaks will be especially worried about this, because if they have to put their birds into lockdown and keep them inside that could lose them their free range label and potential sales. What was looking like a pretty tough Christmas for poultry farmers could be about to get even tougher.  But, as the mass cull of millions of mink in Denmark over Covid-19 worries shows, you have to take the potential problems these viruses can cause very seriously. Under the new national prevention zone rules, keepers with more than 500 birds need to restrict access for non-essential people, workers will need to change clothing and footwear before entering enclosures and vehicles will need to be disinfected regularly, Defra said. Earlier H5N8 cases have been confirmed in three wild geese found dead at the end of last month at the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust (WWT) at Slimbridge, Gloucestershire, swans that died near Dawlish, Devon and a wild goose in Weymouth, Dorset.

Hawkish,Trump says his choice for Pentagon chief is out,2024-09-25,2019-06-18,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-48665798,"US President Donald Trump has announced his choice for defence secretary has withdrawn, shaking up the Pentagon at a time of rising Middle East tensions. He tweeted that Patrick Shanahan has pulled out of consideration ""so that he can devote more time to his family"". Mr Shanahan, who will be replaced by Army Secretary Mark Esper, had not yet been nominated for the cabinet post.  It comes as Mr Shanahan publicly addressed allegations of domestic violence. Mr Trump told reporters Mr Shanahan submitted his withdrawal on Tuesday morning. ""I didn't ask him to withdraw, but he walked in this morning and said it was going to be a rough time for him,"" Mr Trump said, adding that he first heard of the ""unfortunate"" allegations on Monday. Earlier on Tuesday, USA Today reported the FBI was investigating a 2010 incident in which Mr Shanahan and his ex-wife accused each other of assault. Minutes after Mr Trump's announcement, the Washington Post published an interview with Mr Shanahan in which he discussed a 2011 incident when his son, then 17, reportedly beat his mother with a baseball bat, fracturing her skull. In a statement announcing his resignation, Mr Shanahan called it ""unfortunate that a painful and deeply personal family situation from long ago is being dredged up and painted in an incomplete and therefore misleading way"". He said he did not want his three children ""to relive a traumatic chapter in our family's life and reopen wounds we have worked years to heal"". Mr Shanahan added: ""I would welcome the opportunity to be secretary of defense, but not at the expense of being a good father."" On Monday, he told the Washington Post that he regretted a legal memo he penned shortly after the alleged attack on his ex-wife. He wrote that the ""use of a baseball bat in self-defence will likely be viewed as an imbalance of force"" and that ""Will's mother harassed him for nearly three hours before the incident"". Before joining the Trump White House, Mr Shanahan had worked as an executive at Boeing, the US aerospace company which holds many US defence department contracts.  He took over six months ago after the resignation of former Defence Secretary James Mattis.  Patrick Shanahan's decision will extend what is already the longest period of time the US has been without a confirmed secretary of defence.  Under his watch, the Pentagon has begun a build-up of troops in the Middle East in response to tensions with Iran. That will play out as planned, executed by the chain of military command, but still without the political weight of a senior cabinet defence official to guide developing policy and argue the Pentagon's corner at the White House.  Mr Shanahan's critics grumbled that he had ceded too much authority to the White House, that it was the hawkish National Security Advisor John Bolton who was driving policy.  His successor as acting chief of the Pentagon is the Army Secretary Mark Esper. A military analyst, Brigadier General Mark Kimmitt, told the BBC that Mr Esper was a West Point classmate of the Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, and may share the hardline views of Mr Pompeo and Mr Bolton.  Whatever the case, the administration has made clear that President Trump does not want a war in the Middle East, and the troop deployments so far have been relatively small, aimed at protecting US forces and sending a message of deterrence to Iran. Mr Shanahan's tenure saw the longest ever period that the US has been without a permanent secretary of defence. Mark Esper, the current Army secretary, is due to take over in an acting capacity until a new Pentagon chief is nominated.  He was Mr Trump's third choice for the role of Army secretary, after the president's first two nominees - Wall Street billionaire Vincent Viola and Tennessee state Senator Mark Green - withdrew following scrutiny over business ties and controversial comments, respectively. Mr Esper, a 56-year-old Harvard graduate and retired Army infantry officer who served during the US war with Iraq, has been Army secretary since 2017. He also previously worked as the former vice president of government relations at Raytheon, one of the world's largest arms manufacturers. Mr Trump had previously voiced his intention to nominate Mr Shanahan to the post, leading to many questions about who his next choice will be. The defence secretary must be confirmed by the US Senate. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell told reporters on Tuesday Mr Esper was ""a good choice for acting"" secretary, but that it would be ""better to have a confirmed secretary of defence"". His Democratic counterpart Chuck Schumer meanwhile said it was ""appalling"" to have no confirmed defence secretary at this time. ""They have so many empty positions, rotating-revolving doors in the most sensitive of security positions."" The Republican chairman of the Armed Services Committee concurred, saying in a statement: ""For the sake of our national security, we need a confirmed Secretary of Defence - not just an acting. I hope we can get to that point as quickly as possible."" The announcement comes amid renewed tensions between the US and Iran after Washington accused the Islamic republic of attacks last week on two oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman. Mr Shanahan on Monday announced the deployment of 1,000 US troops to the Middle East to counter ""hostile behaviour"" by Iranian forces.  He added that the US does ""not seek conflict with Iran"" and the action had been taken to ""ensure the safety and welfare of our military personnel working throughout the region to protect our national interests"". Mr Trump on Tuesday said the US was ""very well set"" when it came to Iran, adding: ""We'll see what happens."" Speaking on the senate floor earlier, Mr Schumer criticised the administration's lack of transparency on Iran, saying the White House ""has an obligation to explain to the American people exactly what is happening and why"" as US troops are once again sent to the Middle East. ""The president has yet to articulate a strategy about American involvement in the region,"" Mr Schumer said. ""All we have heard is the secretary of state, our chief diplomat, rattling the sabres of war."""
Hawkish,Jordan Peele to produce Bobbitt film,2024-09-25,2018-04-06,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-43667337,"Jordan Peele, Oscar-winning director of horror hit Get Out, has confirmed his next project - a documentary series about Lorena Bobbitt. Bobbitt made headlines around the world in 1993 when she cut off her husband John's penis in a frenzied attack. She later claimed she was the victim of domestic abuse and was found not guilty at trial due to temporary insanity. Peele said the four-part series, which he will executive produce, would give Bobbitt ""a platform to tell her truth"". ""When we hear the name Bobbitt we think of one of the most sensational incidents to ever be catapulted into a full blown media spectacle,"" he said in a statement. The Amazon production, he continued, would allow Lorena, now 47, to ""engage in a critical conversation about gender dynamics, abuse and her demand for justice"". ""This is Lorena's story and we're honoured to help her tell it,"" said Peele, who won an Oscar last month for writing Get Out's screenplay. Get Out used the story of a young black man - played by Britain's Daniel Kaluuya - meeting his white girlfriend's parents to comment on race relations. Amazon's Heather Schuster described Peele as ""a captivating voice of social critique"" with whom the company was ""excited"" to collaborate.

Hawkish,Tributes paid to Emmerdale actor Freddie Jones,2024-09-25,2019-07-10,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-48940202,"Tributes have been paid to the British actor Freddie Jones, known to millions as Sandy Thomas in Emmerdale, following his death at the age of 91. His agent Lesley Duff said he died on 9 July after a short illness. She remembered Jones - the father of fellow actor Toby - as ""a much loved and admired actor, known for his triumphs in theatre, film and TV."" His many feature films include the David Lynch films Dune, Wild at Heart and The Elephant Man. In the latter he played Bytes, the circus ringmaster who cruelly exploits the physically deformed John Merrick. He also appeared in such horror films as Frankenstein Must be Destroyed and The Satanic Rites of Dracula as well as 1983 sci-fi Krull. Jones was most recently known for playing Woolpack regular Sandy in Emmerdale, a role he played for 13 years. He made his final appearance on the ITV soap last year after saying he could no longer justify staying. ""The company generously offered me another 12 months,"" he told the Radio Times. ""But I just thought, 'I have no idea what I'm going to do in another bloody year!'"" Katherine Dow Blyton - Harriet Finch in Emmerdale - said she felt ""so lucky"" to have worked with him. Mark Charnock, aka Marlon Dingle, said Jones was ""an amazing man"" who ""would light up the set with his wit and charm"". ""People like Freddie don't come along very often and everyone at Emmerdale knew what it meant to have him in our cast."" Charlotte Bellamy, who plays Sandy's daughter-in-law Laurel, said she spent her time working with him ""in awe of his professionalism, humour and his zest for life"". The programme posted its own tribute, remembering Jones as ""one of the show's most brilliant actors and favourite human beings"". Jones started out as a laboratory assistant before turning his love of amateur theatre into a professional career. After working in repertory theatre and television, he made his film debut in Peter Brook's Marat/Sade in 1967. Jones was married for more than 50 years to actress Jennie Heslewood, with whom he had three sons. Both Toby and Caspar followed him into the acting profession, while Rupert became a director. In 2009 Freddie and Toby Jones appeared together on The Film Programme to discuss the art of being a character actor. Speaking to broadcaster Matthew Sweet, Jones senior said the secret of making an impression was ""not leaving it on the page, but lifting it up and flying it a bit"". He also revealed he had initially turned down The Elephant Man because he found it ""over-larded with mawkish sentimentality"". ""It didn't need it,"" he said of the film's script, which went on to be nominated for an Oscar and a Bafta. ""The man [John Merrick] was a living tragedy.""

Hawkish,I'm worried about the NHS - Hawking,2024-09-25,2017-08-18,By Nick Triggle,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-40967309,"Stephen Hawking has said he is worried about the future of the NHS, in a speech critical of government policy and Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt. The Cambridge University scientist, who publicly backed Labour in the election, accused Mr Hunt of ""cherry-picking"" evidence to support his policies. The 75-year-old also said he was concerned about the involvement of the private sector in the NHS in England. But Mr Hunt said some of Mr Hawking's comments were ""pernicious"". A statement released by the Department of Health after the text of the speech was given to the BBC in advance said extra money was being invested in the NHS and it had recently been ranked as a top-performing health system. Prof Hawking, who has had motor neurone disease for most of his adult life that has impaired his movement and ability to speak, delivered the speech at a conference at the Royal Society of Medicine in London, organised to air concerns about the future of the NHS. The author of A Brief History of Time, who is a Labour supporter, said he had been motivated to speak because of the role the health service has played in his life, saying if it was not for the NHS he ""wouldn't be here today"". In the speech, Prof Hawking listed a number of occasions on which the NHS was there for him. This included an episode in 1985 when he caught pneumonia in Switzerland.  Doctors there suggested his ventilator be turned off to end his life, but his wife refused and he was flown back to Addenbrooke's hospital in Cambridge where he received treatment and recovered. Fourteen years after that, he had pioneering throat reconstruction surgery in London after his condition worsened and he was struggling to eat and breathe. ""I have had a lot of experience of the NHS and the care I received has enabled me to live my life as I want and to contribute to major advances in our understanding of the universe,"" he said, referring to his theories on black holes and the origin of the Universe. His speech then listed some of the developments in the NHS that concerned him, including the move toward what he called a ""US-style insurance system"". He said he believed there had been an increase in private provision of care, including the use of agency staff, that was leading to profit being extracted from the health service.  ""The more profit is extracted from the system, the more private monopolies grow and the more expensive healthcare becomes. The NHS must be preserved from commercial interests and protected from those who want to privatise it,"" he said. He said that a publicly provided, publicly run system was the ""most efficient"" and so those who say we cannot afford the NHS are wrong.  ""We cannot afford not to have the NHS,"" he added. His speech also mentioned Mr Hunt by name. In a section about the move towards a seven-day NHS, Prof Hawking said that while he would like there to be more services available at weekends, the government has failed to carry out ""proper due diligence"", particularly with regard to whether there would be enough staff. He quoted from a letter he put his name to last year explaining how Mr Hunt ""cherry-picked"" research to put his case.  The health secretary initially said on Twitter that Mr Hawking was a ""brilliant physicist but wrong on the lack of a weekend effect"" in the NHS. He also said the the study into mortality rates associated with weekend NHS services was ""the most comprehensive ever"".  But hours later he posted two further tweets, in which he said Mr Hawking's concerns, about the development in the UK of the type of insurance system seen in the United States, were a ""pernicious falsehood"". He also said the Conservatives had provided the NHS with more money and medical staff than ever before. The Department of Health responded to Mr Hawking's comments by pointing out that the numbers of staff working in the NHS were increasing and it ""makes no apology"" for tackling the weekend effect. The statement pointed out that only about 8% of NHS funding goes to the private sector. It also said that ""despite being busy"", the NHS had been ranked as the ""best, safest and most affordable healthcare system out of 11 wealthy nations"" in a recent study by the Commonwealth Fund. ""The government is fully committed to a world-class NHS, free at the point of use now and in the future - that's why we're backing it with an extra £8bn of investment over the next five years,"" the statement said."
Hawkish,"Lily Allen on demons, divorce and laughter",2024-09-25,2018-06-07,By Mark Savage,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-44384531,"""I actually thought my label would drop me, but they didn't."" Lily Allen laughs. She laughs a lot.  All those acerbic, combative comments you see on her Twitter feed? Imagine them with an almighty guffaw at the end - because that's probably how they were written. Not that she's one to shy away from a fight. Her most recent Twitter clash was with Piers Morgan, who called her ""reprehensible"" for wearing a machine-gun necklace. ""I'll stop wearing the necklace,"" she shot back, ""when you apologise for hacking the phones of dead children."" When Morgan pointed out ""that was another newspaper"", Allen reminded him of how he got sacked from the Mirror for publishing hoax photos of the British military. Later that day, Allen's upcoming appearance on Good Morning Britain was cancelled. So what's the shortest amount of time that's elapsed between her sending a tweet and her publicist phoning in a panic? ""I don't think anyone's ever called me up like that,"" she says.  ""The people who work with me know me well enough to realise that if they call up and tell me not to do something, I'm going to do more of it."" So she tweets about Grenfell, the Calais refugee crisis, Brexit… whatever's on her mind. Allen has a restless personality, and Twitter keeps her occupied. ""That's me on holiday: Refreshing Twitter, laying into some racists,"" she says, laughing again. However, laughter is in short supply on Allen's new album. Called No Shame, it was written over four years, as Allen dealt with the depression stemming from her divorce from Sam Cooper and a terrifying intrusion from a stalker, who broke into her flat while she was sleeping, pulled off her duvet and threatened her. It is a heartbreakingly lonely record. ""I'm at my worst when I'm alone /Can't take the peace,"" she sings, numbed, on the R&B ballad Everything To Feel Something. ""Nothing really moves me any more."" ""I was definitely isolated,"" she says of the last four years.  ""When me and Sam got together, I very much attached myself to his life. His friends became my friends; his family became my family. So when that stopped, I felt at loss.  ""My friends outside of the relationship were, like, my 'showbiz friends' and I didn't want to be in the spotlight at that point. ""Then when the stalker thing happened, I just shut down emotionally in every way. I didn't feel like I could talk to anyone about what I was going through. I just kind of sat at home being sad."" Never one to self-censor, Allen poured all of the heartache into her music.  On What You Waiting For, she takes responsibility for her part in the marriage breaking down. ""Don't know why I was untrue,"" she sings. ""I ran at the first sign of trouble."" Apples finds her reminiscing about the early days of their relationship, until the reality of divorce punctures the daydream.  ""I'm just like my mummy and my daddy,"" sighs the singer, whose parents Keith Allen and Alison Owen separated when she was four.  ""I guess the apple doesn't fall far from the tree."" ""It was devastating,"" she recalls. ""Ethel, my eldest, was four when me and Sam broke up.  It really felt like history was repeating itself and everything I'd worked so hard to [avoid], ended up happening."" The first song Allen wrote for the album was Family Man, which came about pre-divorce. But even then, clouds were gathering. ""I'd just finished an American tour and I should have been wanting to run back to the Cotswolds to be with my family - but I didn't,"" she recalls. Instead, she rented a house in Santa Monica and threw herself into writing sessions - afraid of what might be waiting for her back at home. ""My kids were pining for me [but] I was actually scared of them rejecting me.  ""There'd been moments on the tour where I'd gone home for a few days and if one of them had fallen over, they'd go straight to daddy or to my mum - and that was painful because I obviously wanted them to come to me and feel comforted by me.  ""Because I'd been away for such a long stretch of time, I was convinced they wouldn't even know me so I was like, 'I'll keep working. I'll just be away.'"" Those concerns also inspired the album's most affecting song, Three, which is written from the perspective of her daughter, who's feeling neglected when her mum goes on tour, or is otherwise unavailable. ""You say you love me / Then you walk right out the door,"" she sings. ""Please don't go / Stay here with me / It's not my fault / I'm only three."" In other hands it could be twee and mawkish, but Allen is too dextrous a writer to fall into that trap.   She won't take the compliment (""I'm glad you liked the lyrics - but clever? I don't know about that"") and insists her songs are all created in the heat of the moment.  So there's seriously no preparation? No draft lyrics hidden in her phone? ""It's the same thing as homework when I was at school - I just didn't do it. ""But also if I have a preconceived idea, it automatically feels forced before I've even done it. It's the cringe factor thing."" The star's not a fan of her own voice, either, and refuses to be in the studio when her vocals are mixed - despite attaining a Grade 8 in singing when she was at school. ""Back then, I could sight-read music,"" she recalls. ""I was in a chamber choir, they'd shove a songbook in front of you and it'd just come out.  ""But it was all arias and cantatas - classical stuff. I definitely don't use it any more."" Instead, she uses writing as a way to ""square things off and process"" her feelings - and the tail end of No Shame sees her emerging from the darkness of the last four years. She sings about her new love, grime artist Meridian Dan, on the Kanye-esque Pushing Up Daisies; and challenges the patriarchy on the upbeat, defiant Cake. Allen believes the music's #MeToo moment is yet to come; and says the industry is also failing artists who struggle with mental health issues. ""Mental health and the MeToo thing aren't unrelated,"" says the star, who recently told the i Newspaper she'd suffered abuse in the industry. ""I think there are lots of things being buried and lots of people covering their ears and hoping this whole conversation will go away."" And what of her own record label? They may have decided to keep her… but Allen's relationship with the music industry's gatekeepers has never been simple. She criticises the way No Shame has been promoted, saying she'd have preferred to release the whole album at once, rather than teasing tracks over a period of months. ""It's meant to be listened to as a collection of songs,"" she says. ""It's not singles.  ""If I'd wanted to make radio hits, I would have gone and worked with Greg Kurstin again, or Diplo, or whoever it is that makes radio hits these days."" Her argument is vindicated by the fact that none of those pre-release singles has cracked the Top 40. It's a somewhat hollow victory but Allen, who was signed to a five-album deal in 2005 for the princely sum of £25,000, doesn't seem too concerned. ""Whether this album is a success or not is immaterial to me: I'm still not going to make any money,"" she says. ""But I'm still going to make music and, in a way, that's what I'm most excited about: Getting the next album done and being out of my deal. Because then I can really just start throwing things against the wall."" And Lily Allen throws her head back and laughs. Lily Allen's album is out now.

Hawkish,Putin meets generals as missiles pound Ukraine,2024-09-25,2022-12-17,By Matt Murphy,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-64013052,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has met his military chiefs on the same day his forces launched another wave of missiles at Ukraine's infrastructure.  Mr Putin spent most of Friday at the headquarters of the ""special military operation"" discussing ideas for what Russia's next move should be. It comes as some Ukrainian military officials claimed Russia was planning an offensive, perhaps early next year.  Russian attacks on Ukraine's power grid have plunged millions into darkness. Footage from Friday's meeting showed Mr Putin flanked by Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and Armed Forces Chief Valeriy Gerasimov.  ""We will listen to the commanders in each operational direction, and I would like to hear your proposals on our immediate and medium-term actions,"" the Kremlin leader was seen telling military officials on state TV.  Gen Gerasimov's presence ends rumours circulating online that he had been dismissed from his position. The 67-year-old has been the target of intensive criticism from hawkish commentators, who have accused him of being too cautious.  Air Force general Sergei Surovikin - who was appointed as Russia's commander in Ukraine in October - was also present at the meeting, photos released by state media showed.  Ukrainian forces have made a series of major advances in recent months, including retaking Kherson - the only regional capital captured by Russian forces so far.  And the collapse of Moscow's forces in eastern Ukraine earlier this year saw military bosses come in for sustained criticism from pro-Kremlin media figures.  The meeting followed claims by the commander of Ukraine's military, Gen Valerii Zaluzhnyi, that Moscow could seek to launch a new offensive in early 2023. He warned that Russia was preparing around 200,000 troops for the attack.  ""I have no doubt they will have another go at Kyiv,"" he added. ""I know how many combat units I have right now, how many combat units I have to create by the end of the year - and, most importantly, not to touch them in any way now. No matter how hard it is."" He added that the attack could originate ""in the direction of Kyiv"" and may be launched from Belarus. In February, Russian troops advanced towards the Ukrainian capital Kyiv after crossing the border from Belarus.  While the country's leader Alexander Lukashenko has repeatedly denied that his forces will join in the invasion, thousands of Russian troops are currently in the country taking part in what Moscow's defence ministry called ""intensive combat training"". Mr Putin will visit his Belarusian counterpart in Minsk on Monday.  But analysts have questioned Russia's ability to launch a new offensive on the Ukrainian capital, and White House spokesperson John Kirby said that US intelligence officials ""aren't seeing any indication that there's an imminent move on Kyiv"". Senior US defence officials told Reuters news agency that Russia had been forced to use decades-old ammunition with high failure rates as it burns through its supplies.  They added that ""the rate of fire that Russia has been using its artillery and rocket ammunition"" could see them run out of reliable munitions by early 2023.  Meanwhile, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Saturday that power had been restored to nearly six million people after the latest wave of Russian strikes to hit the country's energy grid.  Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said the city's metro system had restarted and the water supply had been restored.  He also posted photos on Telegram of a large Christmas tree that has been adapted to meet the constraints of a wartime winter. The tree will be lit with energy-saving bulbs run off a generator, he said.  Power has also been restored in the country's second city of Kharkiv, authorities said, after it was left without electricity for hours following Friday's wave of strikes that targeted energy stations across the country. Russia has launched more than 1,000 missiles and Iranian-made attack drones since the wave of strikes on power infrastructure began on 10 October. International leaders - including French President Emmanuel Macron - have said the strikes amount to a war crime. The UK's Ministry of Defence says there had been an ""uptick"" in Russia's campaign of long-range strikes against Ukraine's critical infrastructure in recent days."
Hawkish,Devon rail line closed by sea flooding,2024-09-25,2018-11-09,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-46156825,"A railway line has been closed after high tides washed over a sea wall in Devon and flooded the track. Network Rail has advised train operators Crosscountry and Great Western Railway the sea wall at Dawlish will not be passable for the rest of the day. Train services are not operating between Newton Abbot and Exeter St Davids. A 50mph speed restriction is also in place between Taunton and Plymouth. Crosscountry said it had been advised services could not resume ""until sea levels reduce and the railway line can be inspected"". In 2014 storms caused a section of the Dawlish sea wall to collapse, leaving the rail track to Cornwall suspended in mid-air. And in October flooding opened a 6ft hole under the line, halting services through Devon and Cornwall. Great Western Railway and Crosscountry are accepting each others tickets on their rail and bus replacement services for the rest of the day at no extra charge."
Hawkish,US paper's London crime appeal backfires,2024-09-25,2018-12-13,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-46557035,"An appeal by The New York Times asking readers to share experiences of petty crime in London backfired - when it was hijacked by sarcastic Brits. The esteemed US organ had said it wanted to hear about the Metropolitan Police response to ""minor property crimes"" such as burglary. Instead, it was deluged with thousands of comedy replies on Twitter, including complaints about accidental eye contact on the Tube and badly made tea. It has yet to respond. The Times posted its earnest appeal for London-based tales of woe amid what it called a ""surge in violent crime"" in the capital, telling users it would select the best for publication. However, its social media feeds saw a surge of a different kind, as a deluge of tongue-in-cheek ripostes rolled in and Londoners lapped up the chance to have a laugh at the expense of the paper (and themselves). The unspoken laws of using the London Underground featured heavily among the responses. ""Someone made eye contact with me on the tube once. The culprit is still at large, despite a massive police operation,"" wrote ralasdair. Actor Stephen McGann went one step further, and said his antagonist had even smiled after meeting his gaze - a London Underground faux-pas of the highest magnitude. While Tom Parker Bowles reserved his ire for someone - probably a tourist - who stood on the ""left-hand side of the down escalators at Shepherd's Bush"". Hurried commuter ChazpLDN chipped in: ""A charlatan didn't have his Oyster card ready this morning before getting to the front of the underground queue. Audible tutting ensued."" Others took the opportunity to grass up fellow Brits for their dodgy tea-making practices. ""While visiting an acquaintance who lives in Shepherd's Bush, she offered to make me a cup of tea. I said yes and she put the milk in first,"" @quicunquevult said. Elsewhere, there was ferocious satire of British manners. The Soho Theatre tweeted a scandalous tale of two audience members who once tried to sit in the same seat. Neither apologised, it said. ""It was mayhem, we had to cancel the show."" While Matt Walsh expressed ""horror"" at his neighbours, who ""left their bins out for two days after they were emptied"". The paper was seeking input for a piece by its London-based reporter Ceylan Yeginsu, who said her apartment had been burgled. It is yet to be seen how many of the responses will make it into the final piece."

Hawkish,Dawlish coastal rail route gets further £32m,2024-09-25,2022-04-01,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-60951150,"A further £32m of government funding has been pledged to the Dawlish coastal rail route. It will be used to install new netting and fencing along the rail link, future-proofing the line following the storms in 2014, the government said. Three phases of work have already been carried out to prevent debris reaching the railway. The sea wall has also been rebuilt along the Marine Parade and further cliff protection measures added.  In 2014 the railway was damaged beyond use for six weeks after storms. Following this, the South West Rail Resilience Programme (SWRRP) was launched and since then £155m of funding has been pledged for the South West in total, to ensure that communities will not be disconnected from the rail network for long periods of time. Rail Minister, Wendy Morton said: ""Devon's iconic sea wall, and the picturesque towns surrounding it, are jewels in the British crown, and we're committed to protecting this vital line and the communities it serves. ""Through our wider £155m investment, we're also working to boost connectivity and support the thriving local economy and tourism."" The total investment aims to level-up connections between communities in the South West, the government said.

Hawkish,Trump adviser Gorka out of White House,2024-09-25,2017-08-26,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-41059672,"US President Donald Trump's hawkish deputy national security adviser, Sebastian Gorka, has left the White House, it has been confirmed.    The latest White House departure came a week after his ally, ultra-conservative White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, was dismissed. It is unclear whether Mr Gorka was also sacked or quit of his own accord. He was quoted as writing in a letter that some in the White House were seeking to undermine Mr Trump.   ""[G]iven recent events, it is clear to me that forces that do not support the MAGA [Make America Great Again] promise are - for now - ascendant within the White House,"" he reportedly wrote in the letter, printed on conservative news site the Federalist.  ""As a result, the best and most effective way I can support you, Mr. President, is from outside the People's House."" However, unnamed White House officials told US media he had been forced out. ""Sebastian Gorka did not resign, but I can confirm he no longer works at the White House,"" a source told Reuters news agency.  An unnamed official was quoted by the New York Times as saying the president's chief of staff, John  Kelly, had ""telegraphed his lack of interest in keeping Mr. Gorka during internal discussions over the last week"". Steve Bannon, chief strategist - 18 August Anthony Scaramucci, communications director - 31 July Reince Priebus, chief of staff - 28 July Sean Spicer, press secretary - 21 July Mike Dubke, communications director, 30 May Michael Flynn, national security adviser - 14 February This photo sums up White House turmoil Mr Gorka worked for Mr Bannon before they both joined the Trump administration: He was national security editor at Mr Bannon's Breitbart news website, often writing about the threat posed by Islamist militants. Mr Bannon, sacked after a review by chief of staff Kelly, likewise pledged to remain loyal to President Trump.   In the letter attributed to him, Mr Gorka tells the president: ""Regrettably, outside of yourself, the individuals who most embodied and represented the policies that will 'Make America Great Again,' have been internally countered, systematically removed, or undermined in recent months.  ""This was made patently obvious as I read the text of your speech on Afghanistan this week… The fact that those who drafted and approved the speech removed any mention of Radical Islam or radical Islamic terrorism proves that a crucial element of your presidential campaign has been lost."" On Monday, Mr Trump ruled out withdrawing US troops from the country.  A US citizen who was born in the UK to Hungarian parents, Mr Gorka studied political science in Budapest and is the author of a best-selling book, Defeating Jihad: The Winnable War.    Like President Trump himself, he rails against the mainstream media, accusing the BBC and others of spreading fake news. "

The ECB is expected to leave interest rates on hold at 1% for the 22nd consecutive month. Bank lending is still sluggish and the sovereign debt crisis far from over but it is rising inflation in the Eurozone that will give President Jean-Claude Trichet his biggest headache in deciding whether it is time to raise rates.

Torbay Council and track operator Network Rail said replacing the Torbay Road bridge in Paignton had been delayed because engineers were trying not to disrupt BT cables on site. They said the cables meant the installation of beams to support the road surface would take longer. Roads either side of the bridge were to remain closed, with existing diversions remaining in place, they added. Local access for residents living near ""the life-expired bridge"" was to be maintained, they said. Once the beams were safely in place, engineers were then to build the new bridge and reinstate the highway by 23 May, project bosses said. Work was also under way to open a footpath for pedestrians and cyclists on Sunday 8 May, they added. Scott Pillinger, from Network Rail, apologised for the ""disappointing"" news. He said: ""Unfortunately, the complex nature of the bridge replacement means that we've had to extend the work to ensure the BT cables keep working and that no-one is cut off from these services."" Torbay Council said it had met with Network Rail last week and there would be a site meeting this week with it and the council's highways team to look at a diversion through Wheatridge Road.

Hawkish,How damaged are Lib Dems by fees?,2024-09-25,2010-12-09,Ross Hawkins,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-11964668,"This video can not be played Vince Cable says he is proud of being part of the government and taking tough decisions This has not been easy. Very difficult choices have been made.  That was how the Business Secretary Vince Cable described the process of drawing up reforms to higher education funding. Twenty one Lib Dem MPs rebelled, two of them unpaid ministerial aides - Jenny Willott and Mike Crockart - who both resigned. That reduced the Lib Dem ""payroll vote"" of MPs with jobs as ministers and aides to 21. Eight abstained or were absent. Six Conservatives rebelled. Two abstained, including the Tory ministerial aide Lee Scott who resigned. While the vote was tighter than many anticipated it represented only the second largest rebellion in this parliament. Thirty seven Conservatives rebelled in a vote on the EU budget. At issue for many was a pledge made by all Lib Dem candidates during the election to vote against any rise in fees. Many at Westminster wondered just why Nick Clegg and Vince Cable signed up to that, and allowed their candidates to do the same.  Their plan to cope with the consequences of the pledge failed. It would have seen all Lib Dems - backbenchers and ministers alike - abstain. The aim was to hold the party together. The reality was it risked exposing them to the derision of their opponents.  Mr Cable always supported his own policy. But his suggestion that he might abstain followed by the announcement he would vote for the plans provided a saga he could have lived without. As they debated how to deal with the quandary over the past few weeks, some Lib Dems MPs looked nervously at their colleagues.  As long as senior MPs like former leaders Menzies Campbell and Charles Kennedy were expected to vote against, they were not prepared to simply abstain for fear of looking bad by comparison.  This is not the end of the affair.  Ministers who have been frustrated their efforts to explain the details of the policy have been drowned out by protests and talk of Commons rebellion will hope they can now get their message heard. They believe once people have absorbed the details of the package they will be better disposed towards the policy, and agree it is more progressive than the current system. But while the spectacle of charging police horses, fires, and sporadic violence outside Parliament will distract many from what happened on the green benches of the House of Commons, protest groups will not fail to take note and issue very public reminders of how individual Liberal Democrats voted. The political reality is different. Lib Dems will go into the next election saying different things to voters in their constituencies. Those who voted against will surely remind people, those who supported the policy or abstained will be called on to justify their positions. Vince Cable's policy won the day. The question on which many Liberal Democrats will ponder is what has that victory cost their party? The different tribes of Lib Dems Coalition sees off fees rebellion"

Hawkish,Hawking treasures auctioned for £1.8m,2024-09-25,2018-11-08,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-46144363,"Personal effects of Stephen Hawking, including a signed copy of his 1965 PhD thesis, have raised more than £1.8m at auction. A total of 22 items owned by the Cambridge physicist, who died in March, were auctioned by Christie's. The copy of his thesis titled Properties of Expanding Universes - one of only five - was sold for £584,750 An early wheelchair raised £296,750 for charity and a script for his appearance on The Simpsons sold for £6,250. Christie's said before the nine-day online auction that the items represented the ""ultimate triumph of scientific brilliance over adversity"". The history-making PhD thesis is signed twice by Prof Hawking and was inscribed by the scientist in the year he was diagnosed with motor neurone disease. It was expected to fetch £150,000 but interest from across the world saw it reach almost four times that amount. The lots included medals and awards which sold for a total of £296,750, while Prof Hawking's own scientific papers and library of the works of other famous scientists such as Isaac Newton, Charles Darwin and Albert Einstein, went for sums in the tens of thousands of pounds. Prof Hawking's book, A Brief History of Time, which he signed with a thumbprint in 1988, sold for £68,750, way above the £3,000 guide price. In total the auction raised £1,824,375. The physicist's daughter, Lucy, said Christie's had been helping the family ""manage our beloved father's unique and precious collection of personal and professional belongings"". Proceeds from the sale of the red leather wheelchair will go to the Stephen Hawking Foundation and the Motor Neurone Disease Association. Sophie Hopkins, specialist in manuscripts and archives at Christie's, said much of the collection was ""incredibly iconic""."
Hawkish,Disruption continues as thaw begins,2024-09-25,2018-03-04,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-43275976,"Icy roads and snow are continuing to cause disruption in parts of the the UK but forecasters say temperatures in many areas have risen. Warnings of snow remain in Scotland and ice warnings are in place for north-east England and Northern Ireland.   Many rail services are still affected while two flood warnings are in place. It comes as Scotland's government is considering action against employers accused of docking the wages of staff who were stranded in the snow. Meanwhile, many rural communities in south-west England which had been cut off by poor conditions can now be reached. People in London and the south east of England are being urged to only use water when it is ""essential"" after supplies were hit following the severe weather. In a statement, South East Water and Thames Water said they are providing bottled water to customers after the network suffered multiple bursts and leaks. They urged people to take short showers rather than baths and only run washing machines and dishwashers with a full load, adding: ""This will make a real difference."" Elsewhere, the villages of Lynmouth and Lynton in Devon had their water supply cut off, and roads into the village were impassable due to snow drift. On Sunday evening Devon County Council said the roads to cut-off communities were now clear. Across the country, the NHS said it ""urgently"" needs blood donors to help rebuild stocks after the bad weather led to fewer donations. The UK's economic growth is also likely to take a short-term hit, experts have warned, predicting a ""disaster"" for the high street as people staying at home turned to online shopping. Scottish Transport Minister Humza Yousaf said he had been contacted by workers who were facing disciplinary action or reduced wages for missing work - despite heeding warnings from police not to travel. He told the BBC's Sunday Politics Scotland programme that it was not acceptable and ministers would be looking at the legal position. The Met Office currently has two active yellow warnings in place, covering large areas of the UK.  One, warning of snow and ice, is in place until Monday night across a large area of central and eastern Scotland. Snow showers are expected to continue, the warning says, and there could be icy stretches on untreated surfaces. A second warning for ice in parts of north-east England and Northern Ireland is in force until 11:00 GMT on Monday. The Met Office has also issued a third yellow warning of snow and ice for Tuesday covering northern Scotland. However, temperatures have been rising across England on Sunday.  Two flood warnings - which were reduced from 16 on Sunday - have been issued for coastal parts of south-west and north-east England and are because of high tides, rather than thawing snow.  But in Devon there is a lower-scale flood alert - meaning flooding is possible, rather than expected - on the rivers Clyst and Culm due to snow melt.  The Environment Agency, which had over 30 live flood alerts on Sunday, has warned of a potential surge in water levels. On Saturday the Dawlish rail line, also in Devon, was closed as a result of flooding, but was later reopened. Met Office forecaster Becky Mitchell said there would be a reduced risk of snow across much of southern England and Wales. ""The main point is it's gradually turning milder so we are seeing an end to widespread cold conditions from this weekend onwards."" National Rail has been advising passengers to check their service before travelling while many operators are running to a reduced timetable. On Saturday, Network Rail urged people in the north-east of England and the East Midlands to only travel if ""absolutely necessary"". Virgin Trains East Coast also resumed services between Newcastle and Scotland but advised customers not to travel unless it was essential. Great Western Railway advised passengers not to travel unless the journey is ""unavoidable"" while most rail companies urged people to check before travelling. Meanwhile, an independent investigation will be launched after passengers stuck on four stranded Southeastern trains in Lewisham, south London, ""forced open"" the carriage doors and walked along the tracks. A plan is being put together for a clean-up operation after Holyhead Marina, in Anglesey, north Wales, was battered by Storm Emma. The weather conditions over the past few days damaged a large number of vessels berthed in the marina. In Scotland, government ministers for volunteers to help in clearing up local roads and pavements, and checking on vulnerable people.  Meanwhile in Norwich, an elderly man - described as a ""Good Samaritan"" by his family - died of a suspected heart attack while trying to rescue a motorist stuck in the snow. Airports have been re-opening and train routes resuming, but some operators have warned of reduced or altered timetables. Many airports have now reopened and flights are resuming but some issues still remain and passengers are being advised to check with their airlines. How has the cold weather affected you?

Hawkish,Trump says his choice for Pentagon chief is out,2024-09-25,2019-06-18,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-48665798,"US President Donald Trump has announced his choice for defence secretary has withdrawn, shaking up the Pentagon at a time of rising Middle East tensions. He tweeted that Patrick Shanahan has pulled out of consideration ""so that he can devote more time to his family"". Mr Shanahan, who will be replaced by Army Secretary Mark Esper, had not yet been nominated for the cabinet post.  It comes as Mr Shanahan publicly addressed allegations of domestic violence. Mr Trump told reporters Mr Shanahan submitted his withdrawal on Tuesday morning. ""I didn't ask him to withdraw, but he walked in this morning and said it was going to be a rough time for him,"" Mr Trump said, adding that he first heard of the ""unfortunate"" allegations on Monday. Earlier on Tuesday, USA Today reported the FBI was investigating a 2010 incident in which Mr Shanahan and his ex-wife accused each other of assault. Minutes after Mr Trump's announcement, the Washington Post published an interview with Mr Shanahan in which he discussed a 2011 incident when his son, then 17, reportedly beat his mother with a baseball bat, fracturing her skull. In a statement announcing his resignation, Mr Shanahan called it ""unfortunate that a painful and deeply personal family situation from long ago is being dredged up and painted in an incomplete and therefore misleading way"". He said he did not want his three children ""to relive a traumatic chapter in our family's life and reopen wounds we have worked years to heal"". Mr Shanahan added: ""I would welcome the opportunity to be secretary of defense, but not at the expense of being a good father."" On Monday, he told the Washington Post that he regretted a legal memo he penned shortly after the alleged attack on his ex-wife. He wrote that the ""use of a baseball bat in self-defence will likely be viewed as an imbalance of force"" and that ""Will's mother harassed him for nearly three hours before the incident"". Before joining the Trump White House, Mr Shanahan had worked as an executive at Boeing, the US aerospace company which holds many US defence department contracts.  He took over six months ago after the resignation of former Defence Secretary James Mattis.  Patrick Shanahan's decision will extend what is already the longest period of time the US has been without a confirmed secretary of defence.  Under his watch, the Pentagon has begun a build-up of troops in the Middle East in response to tensions with Iran. That will play out as planned, executed by the chain of military command, but still without the political weight of a senior cabinet defence official to guide developing policy and argue the Pentagon's corner at the White House.  Mr Shanahan's critics grumbled that he had ceded too much authority to the White House, that it was the hawkish National Security Advisor John Bolton who was driving policy.  His successor as acting chief of the Pentagon is the Army Secretary Mark Esper. A military analyst, Brigadier General Mark Kimmitt, told the BBC that Mr Esper was a West Point classmate of the Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, and may share the hardline views of Mr Pompeo and Mr Bolton.  Whatever the case, the administration has made clear that President Trump does not want a war in the Middle East, and the troop deployments so far have been relatively small, aimed at protecting US forces and sending a message of deterrence to Iran. Mr Shanahan's tenure saw the longest ever period that the US has been without a permanent secretary of defence. Mark Esper, the current Army secretary, is due to take over in an acting capacity until a new Pentagon chief is nominated.  He was Mr Trump's third choice for the role of Army secretary, after the president's first two nominees - Wall Street billionaire Vincent Viola and Tennessee state Senator Mark Green - withdrew following scrutiny over business ties and controversial comments, respectively. Mr Esper, a 56-year-old Harvard graduate and retired Army infantry officer who served during the US war with Iraq, has been Army secretary since 2017. He also previously worked as the former vice president of government relations at Raytheon, one of the world's largest arms manufacturers. Mr Trump had previously voiced his intention to nominate Mr Shanahan to the post, leading to many questions about who his next choice will be. The defence secretary must be confirmed by the US Senate. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell told reporters on Tuesday Mr Esper was ""a good choice for acting"" secretary, but that it would be ""better to have a confirmed secretary of defence"". His Democratic counterpart Chuck Schumer meanwhile said it was ""appalling"" to have no confirmed defence secretary at this time. ""They have so many empty positions, rotating-revolving doors in the most sensitive of security positions."" The Republican chairman of the Armed Services Committee concurred, saying in a statement: ""For the sake of our national security, we need a confirmed Secretary of Defence - not just an acting. I hope we can get to that point as quickly as possible."" The announcement comes amid renewed tensions between the US and Iran after Washington accused the Islamic republic of attacks last week on two oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman. Mr Shanahan on Monday announced the deployment of 1,000 US troops to the Middle East to counter ""hostile behaviour"" by Iranian forces.  He added that the US does ""not seek conflict with Iran"" and the action had been taken to ""ensure the safety and welfare of our military personnel working throughout the region to protect our national interests"". Mr Trump on Tuesday said the US was ""very well set"" when it came to Iran, adding: ""We'll see what happens."" Speaking on the senate floor earlier, Mr Schumer criticised the administration's lack of transparency on Iran, saying the White House ""has an obligation to explain to the American people exactly what is happening and why"" as US troops are once again sent to the Middle East. ""The president has yet to articulate a strategy about American involvement in the region,"" Mr Schumer said. ""All we have heard is the secretary of state, our chief diplomat, rattling the sabres of war."""
Hawkish,City square named after slave trader to be renamed,2024-09-25,2020-06-09,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-52983430,"A public square in Plymouth named after a 16th Century slave trader is to be renamed, the city council has said. Sir John Hawkins Square is named after the Elizabethan sailor who is described in the Encyclopaedia Britannica as ""the first English slave trader"". It comes after anti-racism protesters tore down a statue of slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol on Sunday. Plymouth City Council leader Tudor Evans said the city needed to acknowledge ""some aspects of its past"". In a statement made in the council chambers, he said the city had an ""incredible maritime history"". Mr Evans said Plymouth ""cannot change its history, nor does it seek to"", but could use it as ""a reminder of the atrocities"". He also said the Labour-led council's thoughts were with the family and friends of George Floyd, who died last month after a white police officer in Minneapolis knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. Mr Floyd's death has sparked worldwide protests. ""As a council, we have already signalled that we stand in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement,"" Mr Evans said. ""This terrible event in the US illustrates how deeply discrimination and oppression both past and present are felt, and it has highlighted once again that Plymouth needs to continue to acknowledge some aspects of its own past."" Hawkins and his cousin, Sir Francis Drake, made voyages in the 1560s to kidnap people from Africa, carrying slaves from Guinea in West Africa to the Spanish West Indies. A petition to change the name of the square has been signed by nearly 3,000 people since Sunday. Another petition has called for a seafront statue of Drake in Plymouth to be taken down. Mr Evans said the statue of Drake - a former Plymouth mayor - on the Hoe was listed, but the council would ""aim to ensure existing monuments"" were ""accompanied by a narrative referring to their role in the slave trade""."

Lee Pollard and Marc Allen were originally sentenced at Exeter Crown Court in November to 15 months in prison, suspended for 24 months. One of the victim's mothers criticised the outcome. The Court of Appeal has since quashed the original sentences and replaced them with immediate prison terms.  Pollard, 26, of Saxmundham, Suffolk, has been jailed for two years, nine months and Allen, 26, of Torquay, Devon, has been given three years and six months. More news from Devon Pollard and Allen, who were convicted of sexual activity with a child after trial, both denied knowing the girls were underage. The offences took place while the girls were under the influence of alcohol and drugs at a party in Dawlish, Devon. In his sentencing, Judge Graham Cottle said the sexual activity was consensual and the girls were drunk when the men arrived. But their case was referred to the attorney general's office under the unduly lenient sentence scheme after one of the girl's mothers criticised the outcome. Solicitor General, Robert Buckland QC MP, said: ""Despite knowing that the girls were only 14 years old Pollard and Allen engaged them in sexual activity and provided them both with alcohol and drugs.  ""They have no excuse for their behaviour.  ""I hope that the increased sentences will bring some comfort to the girls' families."""
Hawkish,Hawkins quits as Nuneaton Borough owner,2024-09-25,2019-02-12,BBC Sport,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/47215646,"Nicky Eaden (left) was Nuneaton manager when new owner Nick Hawkins arrived on 2 November Nuneaton Borough owner Nick Hawkins has left the financially-challenged National League North club - after just three months in charge. The former non-league footballer took over at Liberty Way on 2 November. But, having been 21st when he arrived, they are now bottom, 15 points from safety with 13 games left and in danger of relegation to the seventh tier. With debts believed to be about £100,000, the club are looking to find 10 local investors at £10,000 per head. Boro, founder members of the Alliance Premier League in 1979, the original fifth division, had been under threat of going out of business for the second time in just over 10 years when Hawkins took over. Former Nottingham Forest trainee Hawkins, who runs a refurbishment company, came in to rescue them. But a statement issued on Tuesday said that he had ""taken the club as far as he could"" and that the ""future of the club would be best served in the hands of people from Nuneaton"". Port Vale owner Norman Smurthwaite also owns Nuneaton's Liberty Way ground, which he bought in June 2018 That statement continued:, external ""The shares in Borough Leisure Ltd, the parent company of the club, will be held in trust by manager Jimmy Ginnelly until new shareholders can be found. ""The club is completing a prospectus for interested parties and will be aiming to find 10 backers, who will take 10% of the shares each, for a rolling payment of £10,000 each season. ""The finer details will be available, upon request, to all interested parties. ""He (Hawkins) will not be listed as a creditor and does not hold any director loans to be repaid."" Hawkins was due to appear on BBC Coventry & Warwickshire at 18:00 GMT. Boro, who reformed as Nuneaton Town as a phoenix club when they first went bust in 2008, were allowed to revert to their name of Nuneaton Borough in 2018. But they have so far looked unlikely to get back to their most fondly remembered days at their old Manor Park home. As Nuneaton Town, they did briefly get back to the fifth tier in 2012, within four years of their reformation, spending three seasons there before relegation under Liam Daish in 2015. Kevin Wilson led them to sixth in National League North a year later, just missing out on the play-offs by a point. But after finishing 12th and 13th in successive seasons, this term they have won just three times in 29 league games under Nicky Eaden and then Ginnelly.

Kevin Gale, 54, was sentenced in January 2019 to be detained indefinitely in a secure hospital. He was deemed unfit to plead at the time, but was returned to Exeter Crown Court after his condition improved to make a plea. A judge said he remained a danger and would only be released with the approval of the justice secretary. The court heard Gale attacked new father Lee Turner, 39, on the evening of 3 August 2018 at a Tesco car park in Barnstaple, Devon, after he thought Mr Turner had given him a ""nasty look"". He stabbed him four times in the back with a 3.5in (9cm) knife. Mr Turner's dying words were ""Why me? What have I done?"", the court heard. Gale, previously of Rackfield Court, Barnstaple, but now of Langdon Hospital, Dawlish, admitted manslaughter and was sent back to Langdon by Judge Peter Johnson. He told him: ""I am satisfied from the medical reports that you still represent a significant risk.  ""It is plain that you are dangerous and that is going to be a lifelong position."" He said Gale had withdrawn from treatment and medication at the time of the killing. ""This sentence achieves the objective of rehabilitation while protecting the public in a fair and proportionate way,"" said the judge. DCI Lee Nattrass said: ""I would like to pay tribute to the family of Mr Turner for their quiet dignity throughout the case and hope that following this conclusion they can look towards the future.""

Earlier, fans had broken into a spontaneous rendition of Happy Birthday for the former Beatle, after he paused to say hello at the start of his set, ""For me?"" he asked, temporarily stopped in his tracks, Saturday's headline performance was one of the most-anticipated Glastonbury sets in years, with diehard fans staking out a front-row place more than 12 hours before the star was due to play. By the time he took to the stage at 21:30BST, the crowd stretched as far as the eye could see, creating what could be the festival's biggest audience since Dolly Parton in 2014. They were rewarded with a marathon two hour, 50 minute set that spanned his six-decade career. He opened with The Beatles' classic Can't Buy Me Love (itself 58 years old) and continued with the Wings' hit Junior's Farm - a cheeky nod to the Eavis family, who host Glastonbury on their Somerset farm each year. ""Oh, man it's so good to be here. We were supposed to be doing this three years ago,"" said McCartney, referring to his Covid-cancelled performance in 2020. ""But here we are. We've got some old songs for you, we've got some new songs and we've got some in-betweeners... and I got a feeling we're going to have a great time."" The setlist featured some of rock's most seminal songs, including Love Me Do and Lady Madonna; Wings classics like Band On The Run; and more recent solo material like the rambunctious Come On To Me. McCartney dedicated the Sinatra-style ballad My Valentine to his wife Nancy Shevell, and played Something on a ukulele given to him by its songwriter, George Harrison. Later, he duetted with the late John Lennon, whose vocals for I've Got A Feeling had been isolated from The Beatles rooftop concert in 1969.  ""That is so special for me,"" said McCartney. ""I know it's virtual, but there I am singing with John again. We're back together."" In total, he played 36 songs, their deep-grained familiarity resulting in some awe-inspiring moments of audience participation: ""See how they run"", or ""you got to give the other fella hell"" and, of course, ""na na na na na na naaaaa..., Hey Jude"" - a refrain that rang around the field for a full four minutes and 40 seconds. Other choices felt more personal, like In Spite Of All The Danger by the Quarrymen, his pre-Beatles band with Lennon and Harrison alongside John Lowe and Colin Hanton. The star acknowledged that some of the lesser-known tracks would throw casual fans.  ""We know the songs you like,"" he said, ""'cause when we play a Beatles song the place lights up with phones like the galaxy. And when we play something new, its like a black hole. But we don't care. We're going to play them anyway."" Still, the last half hour prompted enough phone lights to be seen from space: Get Back, I Saw Her Standing There, Band On The Run, Hey Jude, Helter Skelter and Live And Let Die (punctuated by an insane amount of fireworks). Grohl and Springsteen joined him again for the final song, an extended guitar jam to The End, the penultimate track on Abbey Road, before McCartney left to rapturous applause. For anyone else, it would have been a career-defining show - but when you're responsible for shaping the entire sound, style and trajectory of rock music, the bar is set a little higher.  It's probably still in his top 10, though. Saturday's Glastonbury line-up also included performances from Noel Gallagher, Ghetts, Yungblud and US rapper Megan Thee Stallion. Pop star Olivia Rodrigo drew an immense crowd to her early evening set at The Other Stage, with the audience apparently comprising every teenager at the festival. ""I've never seen so many people in my life,"" she exclaimed. ""I'm so nervous."" But that didn't last long. The audience sang along so forcefully to her signature hit Drivers License that Rodrigo stopped singing and conducted their performance from behind her beautiful mirrorball baby grand piano. Her all-female band added some stadium-sized heft to the ballad, without losing sight of its core emotion - creating one of the weekend's biggest highlights so far. Also impressive were LA sister act Haim, who prowled the Pyramid Stage like three musical Cleopatras, playing the heart out of songs like Now I'm In It, The Steps and Gasoline. During their set, bassist and singer Este Haim recalled the band's Glastonbury debut 10 years ago, when she had passed out on stage due to type 1 diabetes. There was no such issue this time as the band - watched by Stella McCartney, Jude Apatow, Melanie C and Kate Hudson - powered through their percussive, riff-laden singles.  Este explained why after they came off stage, ""My sisters made sure I ate this morning,"" she told BBC News.  ""I ordered her breakfast,"" added her younger sibling Danielle. ""Don't you love sisters?"" Este chipped in, ""The joys and the trials and the tribulations."" On The Other Stage, former Glastonbury headliners Skunk Anansie gave one of the day's loudest and most raucous performances.  Frontwoman Skin sported an impressive, inflatable punk hairdo, which stayed intact even after she jumped into the audience. Less fortunate were alt-pop band Easy Life, whose frontman Murray Matravers was dropped onto his head after attempting to crowdsurf at the Pyramid Stage. ""I was surprised, they dropped me pretty hard"" he told the BBC afterwards. ""But rest assured, it's not my first time. ""It was fine. I prefer it more when it's like that because it adds to the drama and the chaos."" Megan Thee Stallion promised and delivered ""a good-ass time"" on The Other Stage, where she was programmed against McCartney's set. Flanked by dancers, she writhed and twerked and worked the crowd into a frenzy with the pulsing bass of hits like WAP and Body. Like many US performers this weekend, she also brought up the US Supreme Court decision to overturn the constitutional right to abortion. ""You know I wouldn't be me if I didn't say something about these stupid ass men,"" the rapper declared.  ""Texas really embarrassing me right now, y'all. The hot girls and hot boys do not support this shit. My body, my [expletive] choice!""  More from Glastonbury Other highlights of the second day included rock upstart Yungblud joining Squeeze songwriter Chris Difford on the acoustic stage for a surprise rendition of Up The Junction. ""This is definitely one of my Desert Island Discs,"" said the singer, who plays his own set on the John Peel stage later. Elsewhere, rapper AJ Tracey made an impassioned speech about the Grenfell Tower disaster; and climate activist Greta Thunberg, addressed festival-goers on the need for action to prevent climate catastrophe. The festival wraps up on Sunday with sets from Pet Shop Boys, Lorde, Charli XCX, Elbow and headliner Kendrick Lamar. Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

Hawkish,Five things Trump's new security chief believes,2024-09-25,2018-03-23,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-43512175,"John Bolton, a hawkish conservative who rose to prominence in the George W Bush administration, will be the new National Security Adviser to President Donald Trump. A firm defender of American power and a confrontational advocate for wielding that strength abroad, Mr Bolton has never shied away from making his strong views known - whether from a government perch, in the pages of newspapers or from a Fox News pulpit. Here are five things he believes.  Mr Bolton's views on North Korea will draw intense scrutiny as he joins the White House, given a looming summit between President Trump and Kim Jong-un expected to take place by May. The incoming National Security Adviser has made it clear that he believes that North Korea and its nuclear programme pose an ""imminent threat"" to the US, dismissing those who would argue that Washington still has time for diplomacy. ""Given the gaps in US intelligence about North Korea, we should not wait until the very last minute,"" he wrote in the Wall Street Journal in February of possible pre-emptive action. ""It is perfectly legitimate for the United States to respond to the current ""necessity"" posed by North Korea's nuclear weapons by striking first."" Donald Trump is reported to have got rid of his secretary of state Rex Tillerson due to their opposing views on the Iran nuclear deal, which the US president has been deeply critical of. In John Bolton, he will find someone whose views are much more aligned with his.  Mr Bolton has lambasted Barack Obama for agreeing the 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran, writing last year that the text of the agreement ""created huge loopholes, and Iran is now driving its missile and nuclear programs straight through them"". In March 2015, a few months before the deal was agreed, he argued in the New York Times that only military action would suffice.  ""Time is terribly short, but a strike can still succeed,"" he said, advocating Israeli action specifically. ""Such action should be combined with vigorous American support for Iran's opposition, aimed at regime change in Tehran."" ""There is no United Nations,"" Mr Bolton said in a 1994 speech. ""There is an international community that occasionally can be led by the only real power left in the world, and that's the United States, when it suits our interests and when we can get others to go along."" That speech was made more than a decade before he was nominated by the George W Bush administration to be US ambassador to the UN - but Mr Bolton's scepticism of a global body accountable to no one sovereign nation is deeply held. The Economist called him ""the most controversial ambassador ever sent by America to the United Nations"", but he also won praise in some quarters, for fiercely pushing for reform of the international institution.  Just a few weeks ago, the president was calling the US-led invasion in 2003, ""the single worst decision ever made"". Around the same time, John Bolton, who backed it strongly, was refusing to condemn it. ""When you say the overthrow of Saddam Hussein was a mistake, it's simplistic,"" he is reported to have said in a Fox News appearance. In 2016, when he was mulling a bid for the Republican presidential nomination, Mr Bolton was less equivocal. ""If you knew everything you do today, of course you'd make different choices, but I'd still overthrow Saddam Hussein, who was a threat to peace and stability in the region,""  the Washington Post quoted him as saying. Mr Bolton has described Russian interference in the 2016 US election as a ""true act of war, and one Washington will never tolerate"". In July 2017, when President Trump met President Putin and the Russian leader denied Russian meddling, Mr Bolton wrote that he was ""lying with the benefit of the best KGB training"". More recently, following the poisoning of ex-spy Sergei Skripial in the UK - an attack blamed on Russia - Mr Bolton said the West should respond with a ""very strong answer""."

Hawkish,What does Europe make of Boris Johnson's resignation?,2024-09-25,2022-07-07,By Katya Adler,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-62081384,"Is the European Union rubbing its hands with glee at Boris Johnson's downfall? Yes, but also no.  When asked by journalists on Thursday if any extra bottles of champagne had been ordered in response to news of his resignation, an EU spokesman drily responded: ""We have a very limited consumption of alcoholic beverages in the (European) Commission."" This is a presumed dig at Mr Johnson, who recently admitted there was ""a problem with alcohol"" in UK political circles. He was also accused of tolerating and attending boozy gatherings at Downing Street during the strict Covid-19 lockdown. It was one of the many scandals that have now resulted in him being politically forced from office. Sneers and smirks are all over the European press. Mr Johnson is not beloved in the EU. That's less down to the EU dislike of Brexit itself, which certainly exists. But European antipathy towards Johnson is mainly the result of his perceived handling of the UK's exit from the bloc vis-à-vis Brussels.  A polite word for how European politicians regard that would be duplicitous. EU leaders accuse the PM of blustering his way through Brexit and failing to be honest with the British people about its true implications. Rather than negotiating and keeping his word on post-Brexit agreements with Brussels, he's viewed by EU politicians as constantly shifting and changing. More preoccupied with playing to the political gallery back home, than fulfilling international obligations or acting consistently in (what the EU assumes to be) the best interests of the UK. The Johnson government Bill, currently making its way through the UK Parliament, to unilaterally rewrite the international post-Brexit treaty on Northern Ireland, has perturbed even the most phlegmatic of EU politicians, like the German chancellor.  While the French never shy from attacking the UK over Brexit, it's new for Berlin to be as outspokenly critical. A week ago, Germany's foreign minister made a barely-veiled jab at Mr Johnson: ""London is unilaterally breaking agreements... and it is doing so for predictable motives of its own,"" Annelena Baerbock said. ""We in the EU cannot accept that."" 'Borexit' screamed Germany's biggest tabloid, Bild, on Thursday. It also chose to write an English headline: ""Bye Bye Boris"". While Denmark's leading tabloid Ekstrabladet mocked Mr Johnson's election-winning pledge to Get Brexit Done with its header: ""Now he is done."" It was after Mr Johnson's involvement in Brexit negotiations, that I noticed even staunch allies of the UK, like Denmark and also the Netherlands, showing clear signs of impatience. In particular, over the post-Brexit deal on Northern Ireland. Relations with the neighbouring Irish Republic worsened as well. They became ""strained and challenged"" according to Irish prime minister, Taoiseach Micheál Martin. But he noted on Thursday that Mr Johnson's departure could be an opportunity for a ""reset"". Also sounding optimistic, was the EU's often-lecturing former Brexit negotiator, Frenchman Michel Barnier. He tweeted on Thursday that this may be the beginning of a new chapter for the EU and UK. ""More respectful of commitments made, in particular regarding peace & stability in Northern Ireland, more friendly, more constructive…,"" he wrote. ""Dream On!"" say most EU diplomats I've been chatting to.  They regard the mass resignations of Conservative ministers around Boris Johnson as self-serving attempts to save their career, they tell me, rather than signs of disagreement with his policies, Brexit-related or otherwise. ""This Johnson resignation just means more uncertainty for us Europeans. More UK inward-looking obsession with its own domestic dramas, rather than looking outwards towards partners abroad,"" grumbled one particularly fed-up EU diplomat who spent years working on Brexit. ""And all this, with war back here on our continent,"" he added. ""The UK needs to get a grip."" Talking about the war in Ukraine, Boris Johnson's attitude towards Russia is one aspect of his premiership that - not only Kyiv - but EU and Nato members in Eastern and Central Europe will miss very much. Back in December, even before the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine, Poland's prime minister - Mateusz Morawiecki - told me Mr Johnson clearly understood the Russian threat, unlike many other leaders in the West.  Central European diplomats were often unwilling to criticise Mr Johnson in public over Brexit because, they said privately, he was such a close ally when it came to security matters (in this context, they meant Russia). But even they believe this to be a UK stance, rather than a hawkish attitude peculiar to Boris Johnson. Summing up the EU mix of fascination and Schadenfreude at Boris Johnson's demise, as well as trepidation at what might come next, one senior figure told me, rather tongue-in-cheek: ""I'm keeping one hand in my bag of popcorn, and the other on my nervous heart."""
Hawkish,Where's Europe's leadership in Russia's war?,2024-09-25,2022-06-22,By Katya Adler,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61904360,"Ukrainians are fighting and dying, while Lithuania has just been directly threatened by Russia.  Germans are talking up energy rationing ahead of winter and the UN is warning of a global food crisis because of Russia's Black Sea blockade, impeding Ukraine's crucial grain exports. We're slap bang in the middle of a European security crisis - fast becoming a global one. And EU leadership is noticeably lacking. Over the next week alone, there's an EU summit in Brussels, a meeting of the G7 world's richest nations in Germany and a huge Nato defence alliance summit in Madrid. But where is that convincing European figure, able to speak on behalf of all the bloc's leaders? Angela Merkel, Germany's famous former chancellor, was far from perfect. For starters, Russia's dominance and leverage over EU energy supplies were things she was at least partially responsible for.  But she was a good crisis manager with a canny ability to knock (EU leaders') heads together when necessary to find a way forward. Think of the Greek debt crisis or the tail end of the migrant crisis, for example.  And now? Olaf Scholz, her successor as head of the EU's richest nation, has failed spectacularly to take the lead in the crisis over Ukraine. He has implemented huge change at home, pledging to modernise and invest in Germany's military for the first time since the end of the Second World War. Considering long-standing sensitivities back home, that is no mean feat.  But look at his dismal popularity ratings in Germany or ask his colleagues in Europe: Mr Scholz has not grabbed the moment.  Instead, he has given the impression, since Russia began its invasion, of being very much on the back foot - when it comes to weapons deliveries to Ukraine, to name but one example.  And what of France, the EU's other traditional leading country? Emmanuel Macron cherished the hope, when Angela Merkel exited politics stage right last autumn, that the crown of ""de facto"" EU leader would then be his.  But even before his drubbing in last weekend's parliamentary elections in France, Mr Macron was not a trusted figure in Brussels. Many (particularly those geographically closer to Russia, such as Poland and the Baltic countries) suspect him of being too soft on the Kremlin.  Hackles were raised recently when he spoke of the need not to humiliate Russian President Vladimir Putin in order to maintain the possibility of a diplomatic solution to the conflict in Ukraine. They, the countries with shared geography and a history with Russia, are ""new"" EU leading powers, emerging as a direct result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  Poland's voice, along with the three Baltic states, has been getting increasingly loud in Brussels - and within the Nato defence alliance too.  They feel vindicated after years of warning the West not to ""sleepwalk"" into a security crisis with the Kremlin and their viewpoints are now being heard with more respect.  In this cacophony of EU voices on Ukraine, we can't omit Hungary. Its freshly re-elected and even more self-confident Prime Minister, Victor Orban, has played a prominent role as a thorn in the side of the EU in the current crisis.  He held up, and succeeded in watering down, the most recent sanctions package, which included a strategically important phased embargo on Russian oil.  Sanctions, like all foreign policy decisions in the EU, need to be agreed unanimously amongst the 27 member countries. And despite the severity of the current crisis, no other European leader was able to persuade Budapest to step in line with the rest. This is not to suggest EU is falling apart over Ukraine. At this week's Brussels summit, EU leaders plan to announce a joint decision to offer Ukraine candidacy status (a largely symbolic move, allowing the country to start the long process of applying for EU membership).  EU leaders will also repeat their pledge to help Ukraine economically and militarily. But the longer Moscow's military onslaught continues, the harder it is becoming to maintain unity of purpose inside the EU and the wider Western coalition. There are splits, for example, over what Ukraine's war aims should be.  Western powers agree Russia must be seen to have failed in Ukraine. But what does that mean in practice?  Officially, of course, allies say it's up to Ukraine to decide its own military objectives. But Western weapons deliveries (how much and what types of weapons) will be key in influencing what action the Ukrainian military can take. Again, countries physically closer to Russia (the Baltics, Poland and much of former communist central Europe too) are more ""hawkish"" in their attitudes.  Estonia's prime minister told me that if Ukraine were forced to make territorial concessions in order to reach a ceasefire, far from appeasing Moscow, it would mean the Kremlin would come back for more. There's a feeling that Russia must be taught a lesson.  These EU countries feel far more aligned in their thinking with the UK, where Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Foreign Secretary Liz Truss have been very outspoken about Russia, than with traditional EU powers Germany, France and Italy. Berlin, Paris and Rome, by contrast, are concentrating on an end to hostilities in Ukraine. Not at any price, of course. The support for Ukraine and its military is genuine.  But many leaders in Western Europe have domestic opinion polls on their mind. Voters worry about the conflict in Ukraine spreading and taking on a nuclear dimension.  Rising food and fuel prices, resulting from the war, are cause for concern too. Leaders in Western Europe also fret about the potential for a new migrant crisis, if people in the Middle East and Africa end up fleeing hunger provoked by Russia preventing sea exports of Ukrainian grain. The US is trying to straddle these contrasting views, hoping to keep a Western coalition together. Its long-term view is that we're in a new Cold War. And the US needs Europe to counter China with Russia by its side (as long as it suits those powers to work that way). Washington has been keen to encourage support in Asia too. Japan and South Korea have been invited as observers to the big Nato summit in Madrid next week, as have Australia and New Zealand. An alliance of Western-style democracies is how it's portrayed. And the EU is very much part of this alliance. However, its dream of becoming a key political, as well as economic, player will come to little if the bloc continues to muddle through, lacking decisive leadership."
Hawkish,Europe fights to maintain solidarity in Ukraine war,2024-09-25,2023-02-20,By Katya Adler,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-64637091,"Joe Biden's surprise visit to Ukraine on Monday is a striking show of solidarity - an intentionally powerful message to Moscow - as Kyiv prepares to mark the grim and bloody one-year anniversary of Russia's invasion. Ukraine's government was understandably thrilled to see the US president but - as a professional Europe-watcher - one comment stood out for me in particular. Deputy Foreign Minister Andriy Melnyk celebrated what he described as ""the presence of our important, main partner."" Shouldn't that be Europe? Vladimir Putin's aggressive ambition is a threat to European security first and foremost. His invasion of Ukraine has brought conventional warfare back to this continent on a scale not seen since World War Two. His actions have shattered the sense of peace and relative security most of us were used to. For the first time since the Cold War, the possibility of a nuclear attack is being discussed as a real possibility - however remote. But Europe - in and outside the EU - is a sum of many and diverse parts. Russia's invasion has been a clear reminder to Europeans - even France's President Macron, the normally outspoken advocate of Europe's ""strategic autonomy"" - that, in terms of defence - the continent can't go it alone. The money, the military and weaponry, the united resolve isn't there compared to the US (and even there, some tiny political fractures are beginning to show). That said, the Kremlin underestimated Europeans a year ago. It bet on them being weak and wholly divided, with each country looking out only for its short-term benefits (like stable energy prices). And the United States being distracted by China. Vladimir Putin underestimated leaders' resolve to stand by Ukraine and their version of European stability. Russia's invasion of Ukraine changed Europe. Countries have come together - some slower, or more reluctantly than others - but still:  with unprecedented sanctions against Russia. Western allies' initial red lines have been repeatedly broken as they've clubbed together to send increasingly powerful weaponry to help Ukraine. As the war now approaches its second year, that unity - however imperfect - still holds. Though flickers of public dissent are appearing, for a number of reasons. Take European big power Germany. The Markus church in Berlin's Steglitz neighbourhood was packed when I visited recently. Refugees sat side-by-side with German locals as the hauntingly beautiful voices of a Ukrainian mother and daughter singing traditional songs floated out into the freezing night. Though Europe's biggest economy has conspicuously failed to play a leading role in the Ukraine crisis, Germans call the war their ""watershed moment"". They opened their arms to around a million refugees and transformed post-war defence policies to help Kyiv. Along with other European allies, Germany's leaders agreed to send heavy weapons, missile launchers and most recently its prestigious Leopard 2 tanks to help Ukraine fight off Russia's invading forces. But the sentiment of solidarity is slipping a bit. And not only in Germany. In stark contrast to the proclamations of Europe's political leaders, 48% of the public want a quick end to hostilities, even if that means Ukraine having to hand over some of its territory to Russia.  That was the finding of an end-of-2022 survey published by research group Euroskopia, based on questions put to a total of 9,000 people in nine EU countries. This doesn't mean almost one in every two Europeans is preparing to turn their back on Ukraine. As the BBC's Europe editor, I travel regularly around the continent. Wherever I go, people tell me they want the suffering there to stop. But as the war grinds bloodily on, views differ sharply over how much they want their country to still be involved, at what cost to them, their family or their businesses (think about spiralling energy costs) or the risk some analysts talk about of the war ""escalating"" beyond Ukraine, perhaps even involving nuclear attacks, and also to what extent they think Russia should be pushed back or punished. War-weariness is certainly something that Ukrainians are increasingly having to contend with - whether they are refugees looking for lodgings or politicians in Kyiv trying to drum up more military support. ""One month, two months, three months… I was with a German family for eight months!"" Nina from Kharkiv told me, as I sat with her, towards the back of the Berlin church. ""They were like real family. Wonderful. And they didn't actually ask me to leave. But I knew it was not good. Guests are great but not for so long. We don't know when this war will end.""  Donations for refugees have plummeted an eye-watering 95% since the start of the conflict, according to church chaplain Sven Grebenstein. More than fatigue with the Ukraine war, he thinks Germans have been distracted by the impact of the cost-of-living crisis, linked to the conflict. ""[Germans] were falling over themselves to help 12 months ago. They were generous with their time and their money. But then they saw their bills - gas, electricity and food - shoot up. They started being more careful with money they might need for themselves."" Italy, like Germany, used to be hugely reliant on Russian gas, before the EU slapped sanctions on Moscow following its invasion of Ukraine. The energy crisis hit hard. Half of Italians don't want to send any more weapons to Ukraine, according to opinion polls. Only 26% say they support more sanctions against Russia, if they'd make life more expensive. The same study suggests the percentage in France is 27%. This is a world away from the strongly pro-Nato, pro-military aid stance taken by Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni or President Macron. You can't help wondering if that gap between leaders and so many voters is sustainable. Suspicion of the US and Nato and an openness to the Russian narrative is something you often come across in Italy.  Murano, near Venice, is famous for the eye-catching, centuries-old artisanal skill of glass blowing. To create stunning, mouth-moulded vases, stools, bowls and even chandeliers, the glass needs to be molten. Furnaces are kept at a constant temperature of 1200-1400C.  The industry has been decimated by spiralling energy bills. But when I visited the Wave Murano Glass factory, I found many workers unwilling to blame Moscow.  Young Gabriele told me he didn't want to compare his family's suffering to that of civilians in Ukraine but, he insisted, the war had claimed victims all over the place. The cost-of-living crisis is very real for him and his elderly parents living on a basic state pension. He wasn't an expert on politics, on who's right and who's wrong but, he said, the war needed to stop. Factory founder Roberto Beltrami told me Italian attitudes were also affected by the fact that so many businesses had traditionally strong links to Russia. Moscow is well aware of this. Italy and Germany are big targets of Russian disinformation campaigns. Travel 2,000km to the north-east and, in the Baltic states, you find a completely different European picture. Losing business and investment here is in no way viewed as an obstacle to a tough line against Moscow and public opinion is overwhelmingly in favour of strong support of Ukraine. Tiny Estonia spends more than 1% of its GDP on military aid to Kyiv.   The Baltics are viewed as some of Europe's most ""hawkish"", or hardline nations when it comes to dealing with Russia. Poland and the UK have a similar profile, with the Netherlands not far off. Estonian Defence Minister Hanno Pevkur told me Russia's invasion on 24 February 2022 resonated here in particular, as it coincided with Estonia's independence day. Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania were occupied for almost 50 years before the collapse of the Soviet Union. Geographical neighbours of Russia, they've lived in permanent fear of being invaded again. Members of the EU and Nato, they're relieved other Western countries now see Russia as a strategic threat to all of Europe, rather than dismissing as a ""regional issue"" the Kremlin's designs on Ukraine and potentially reasserting its influence over other neighbours. Ambassador Christoph Heusgen, who chaired the weekend's annual Munich Security Conference, used to be a key adviser to German ex-chancellor Angela Merkel. She's now blamed by many for having harnessed her country far too closely to Russia.  When I asked him if he now felt he had been short-sighted, he insisted Germany's relationship with Russia was hugely complex. You need only remember the 20 million people slaughtered by the Nazis on lands then belonging to the former Soviet Union. But he conceded that the perspective of Western European leaders on Russia had now definitely changed. ""They recognise this is an attack on Europe. This is an overall attack on the European security architecture,"" he told me. ""I personally believe, and I think many do, that if Putin would be able to conquer Ukraine, he wouldn't stop there. He would continue to... reinvigorate and re-establish the Soviet Union in all those territories that he believes Russia lost. Moldova is talked about. But I think also he has put his eyes on the Baltic countries."" It's for this reason the EU is now turning its attention, though critics argue not enough, to Moldova and Georgia. Even to Armenia and Azerbaijan. And it's why the Baltics describe themselves as Europe's front door. They've long called on the West to bolster them in order to protect the continent from an aggressively ambitious Russia. In the snowy wilds of the dense pine forests outside Tallinn, the Estonian capital, I saw for myself how Nato had paid attention. Its presence in the region has been massively increased. A huge military exercise was under way, complete with tanks, Chinook helicopters and trench warfare. The multinational troops I spoke to - from France, the UK, Denmark and of course Estonia - were clear why they were there. ""I'm proud to defend Europe,"" Julien, a young French lieutenant, said smilingly. ""We are one,"" declared Bernadita, a military planning officer from Copenhagen. ""And an attack against one of us is an attack against all.""  But public disengagement we're seeing in pockets of Europe must give pause for thought.  And after the conflict finally ends? Never mind a divided public, there's no unity even among Europe's leaders as to how to deal with Russia. Isolate or try to re-integrate, based on the premise that the future security of Europe cannot be meaningfully discussed without Moscow somehow being included? These questions are looming but as yet, unanswered."

Hawkish,Grieving father joins commentator's challenge,2024-09-25,2023-06-20,By Steve Knibbs,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-gloucestershire-65961045,"The father of a nine-year-old boy who died unexpectedly has joined a sports commentator on the final stint of his trip from John O'Groats to Land's End. Olympic broadcaster and snooker announcer Rob Walker, 48, from Gloucestershire, is covering more than 1,000 miles in a charity challenge. On Monday, he was joined by Paul Hawkins, who lost his son George at Christmas. Mr Hawkins said Mr Walker was ""an inspiration"". ""It's a privilege to come along and be able to help him,"" he added as he joined him for Monday's leg - running from Gloucester to Clevedon, in North Somerset. ""It has been a difficult time this year and Rob has been a huge help.  ""I think it's been a sort of bonding experience, as awful as it has been, (and) Rob's been a true friend throughout."" He revealed that Mr Walker read George's eulogy at his funeral and it was ""the least"" he could do to help him. Mr Walker - who was also supported by BBC Sport presenter Jill Douglas in Gloucester - has dubbed his challenge The Absent Friends Tour and is raising funds for two charities. During the challenge, he has handed out four bottles of champagne every day - one for each friend - so people along the way can toast their lost friends with his. The commentator, who will finish his challenge on Friday, lost Robin Thomas to a heart attack at the age of 48 in October 2021, followed by university friend Martyn Settle two months later aged just 45. Another of Mr Walker's friend's, Stephen Isles, who had lived with a brain tumour for 10 years, died at the age of 53 in May 2022. The three deaths happened with eight months of each other and inspired Mr Walker to raise money for charity. While he was preparing for his challenge George died. Mr Walker has set up a fundraising page for The Brain Tumour Charity and Jessie May Children's Hospice at Home. He has already hit his £25,000 fundraising target but is still urging people to donate. Sport promoter Barry Hearn has agreed to double every donation that specifically goes to the hospice, he added. As he nears the finish line, Mr Walker said it ""starts to kind of hit home"" what the challenge is all about. ""When your mates are going through difficult times we have to be there,"" he said.

Hawkish,Wales back Hawkins among three Exeter signings,2024-09-25,2023-04-03,BBC Sport,https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-union/65164384,"Hawkins played in four of Wales' matches during the Six Nations campaign this year Exeter have signed Wales back Joe Hawkins on a ""long-term deal"" from United Rugby Championship side Ospreys for the 2023-24 season.  The highly rated 20-year-old centre has been capped five times since making his international debut last November. Yet the move means Hawkins falls short of the eligibility change recently brought in by the Welsh Rugby Union.  Those playing outside of Wales are now required to have 25 caps to represent their country. Barring any caveats, that would make Hawkins ineligible for the Rugby World Cup in France later this year. Exeter have also signed forward Ethan Roots from Ospreys and former Newcastle Falcons and Wasps fly-half Will Haydon-Wood from French Pro D2 side Massy Esonne for next season. New Zealand-born back-rower Roots, 25, joined the Welsh side in 2021 from Crusaders and has made 14 appearances for the team this season, while Hayden-Wood moved to Massy Esonne after Wasps were suspended from the Premiership last October. Hawkins, who graduated through the Ospreys academy and made the first of his 28 appearances for the club aged 18, said he was ""really excited"" by his switch to Sandy Park. ""Over the years the Chiefs have been known for bringing through youngsters and giving them their chance on the biggest stages,"" he told the club website., external ""I want to be part of that and to try and take the club onwards and upwards."" Hawkins will become part of a growing Welsh contingent of players at Exeter, alongside Oli Burrows, Dafydd Jenkins, Dan John and Christ Tshiunza, all of whom he has played with before.  In February, Exeter director of rugby Rob Baxter said that there was ""no truth"" in the rumours that the club were interested in signing Hawkins. However, following the announcement Baxter said he was a player that they have had a ""close eye on for some time"". ""We're delighted to have Joe signed on for next season and beyond,"" he added.  ""He was someone I spotted when we were looking at footage of Daf and a few of the other Welsh Under-20s. ""We do have players moving on at the end of this season, so it was important that we looked at the areas we needed to fill and that we brought in the right players. ""Joe, I think, ticks pretty much every box that we look for in a player and I've no doubt he's going to be a great addition to the squad.""

Hawkish,Who's in Putin's inner circle and running the war?,2024-09-25,2022-03-03,By Paul Kirby,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-60573261,"Vladimir Putin has often cut a solitary figure as Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine drags on, but his position is bolstered by a deeply loyal entourage that has hardly changed in years. As commander in chief, ultimate responsibility for the invasion rests with him, but he is reliant on an inner circle, many of whom began their careers in Russia's security services.  Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin was once a close and powerful ally, but never part of that circle. So who does have the president's ear at this defining moment of the war?  For months, two men have been in Prigozhin's crosshairs, Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and the head of the armed forces, Valery Gerasimov. He has accused both of responsibility for the deaths of tens of thousands of Russians in the war in Ukraine. What was a bitter and long-running feud has turned into a national crisis. If anyone has the president's ear, it is his defence minister, a long-time confidant who has in the past gone with him on hunting and fishing trips to Siberia and was once viewed as a potential successor. He has dutifully toed the Putin line, first that Russia was demilitarising Ukraine and then that it was the ""collective West"" that had launched the war, not Russia. Sometimes you wonder how much of President Putin's ear he is able to reach. This extraordinary photo was taken three days into the invasion in February 2022. Barely had Russia's military campaign begun and it was struggling with unexpected Ukrainian resistance and low military morale. ""Shoigu was supposed to be marching to Kyiv; he's minister of defence and was supposed to win it,"" said Vera Mironova, a specialist in armed conflict.  And yet he is still playing a vital role in the war, although Prigozhin accuses him of lying to the president about the reality on the ground in Ukraine. He was credited with the military seizure of Crimea in 2014. He was also in charge of the GRU military intelligence agency, accused of two nerve agent poisonings - the deadly 2018 attack in Salisbury in the UK and the near-fatal attack on opposition leader Alexei Navalny in Siberia in 2020. The picture looks even worse as a close-up. ""It looks like a funeral,"" says Ms Mironova. It may look awkward, but Russian security expert and writer Andrei Soldatov has suggested the defence minister is the most influential voice the president hears. ""Shoigu is not only in charge of the military, he's also partly in charge of ideology - and in Russia, ideology is mostly about history and he's in control of the narrative.""  As chief of staff, it was his job to invade Ukraine and complete the job fast - and by that standard, he was found wanting.  But there is a reason he is the longest-serving chief of staff since the Soviet era. Vladimir Putin clearly has faith in him. He has played a major role in Russian military campaigns ever since he commanded an army in the Chechen War of 1999, and he was at the forefront of military planning for Ukraine too, overseeing pre-war military drills in Belarus. Described as an ""unsmiling, craggy bruiser"" by Russia specialist Mark Galeotti, Gen Gerasimov also played a key role in the military campaign to annexe Crimea. Initially there was talk of him being sidelined, because of the stuttering start to the invasion of Ukraine and reports of poor morale among the troops. He failed to appear in the annual Moscow military parade in May 2022. And yet in January this year, he was appointed commander of forces in Ukraine, replacing Gen Sergei Surovikin, who is now his deputy. ""Putin cannot control every road and every battalion, and that is his role,"" said Andrei Soldatov.  ""Patrushev is the most hawkish hawk, thinking the West has been out to get Russia for years,"" says Ben Noble, associate professor of Russian politics at University College London.  He is one of three Putin loyalists who have served with him ever since the 1970s in St Petersburg, when Russia's second city was still known as Leningrad.  The other two stalwarts are security service chief Alexander Bortnikov and foreign intelligence head Sergei Naryshkin. All the president's inner circle are known as siloviki, or enforcers, but this trio are closer still. Few hold as much influence over the president as Nikolai Patrushev. Not only did he work with him in the old KGB during the communist era, he replaced him as head of its successor organisation, the FSB, from 1999 to 2008.  It was during a bizarre meeting of Russia's security council, three days before the invasion, that Mr Patrushev pushed his view that the US's ""concrete goal"" was the break-up of Russia. He has since accused the US of preparing ""biological war"", and Washington and London of leading the West in the hope of defeating Russia. When the Kakhovka dam was blown up in Russian-occupied southern Ukraine in a suspected Russian attack, he blamed Ukraine, backed up by the US, UK and their Nato allies. ""He's the one who has the chief battle cry, and there's a sense in which Putin has moved towards his more extreme position,"" says Ben Noble. Kremlin watchers say the president trusts information he receives from the security services more than any other source, and Alexander Bortnikov is seen as being part of the Putin inner sanctum. Another old hand from the Leningrad KGB, he took over the leadership of its replacement FSB when Nikolai Patrushev moved on.   The FSB has considerable influence over other law enforcement services and even has its own special forces. He's important, but he's not there to challenge the Russian leader or give advice in the same way as others, believes Andrei Soldatov. Completing the trio of old Leningrad spooks, Sergei Naryshkin has remained alongside the president for much of his career. That has not stopped President Putin giving him a televised dressing-down when he fluffed his lines on being asked for his assessment of the situation before the war.  The lengthy session was edited, so the Kremlin had clearly decided to show his discomfort in front of a big television audience. ""Putin loves playing games with his inner circle, making [Naryshkin] look a fool,"" said Andrei Soldatov. Sergei Naryshkin has long shadowed the president, in St Petersburg in the 1990s, then in Mr Putin's office in 2004 and eventually becoming speaker of parliament. But he also heads the Russian Historical Society and has proved important in providing the president with ideological grounds for his actions. He once denied in an interview with BBC Russia Editor Steve Rosenberg that Russia had carried out poisonings and cyber-attacks or had interfered in other countries' elections. For 19 years, he has been Russia's most senior diplomat, presenting Russia's case to the world, even if he is not considered to have a big role in decision-making.  Sergei Lavrov, 73, is yet more proof that Vladimir Putin heavily relies on figures from his past. He is unlikely to have cared that most of the UN human rights council walked out as he tried to defend Russia's invasion days after it began. Although a Putin loyalist from the start, he is not thought to have any role in decision-making on Ukraine. His task is to shore up support for Russia in Africa, Latin America and elsewhere, promoting his country as a decoloniser.  He has taken Russia's war rhetoric to extremes in an attempt to paint Ukraine as a ""Nazi regime"". The fact that Ukraine's president was Jewish meant nothing, he argued. ""I could be wrong, but Hitler also had Jewish blood.""  He was wrong, and offensively so.  A rare female face in the Putin entourage, she oversaw the upper house's vote to rubber-stamp the deployment of Russian forces abroad, paving the way for invasion. Valentina Matviyenko is another Putin loyalist from St Petersburg who helped steer through the annexation of Crimea in 2014 as well. But she is not considered to be a primary decision-maker. That said, few people can say with complete certainty who is calling the shots and taking the big decisions.  A former bodyguard of the president, he now runs Russia's national guard, Rosgvardia, formed by President Putin in 2016 as a kind of personal army in the style of a Roman empire-like praetorian guard. By choosing his own personal security guard to front it, he made sure of its loyalty, and Viktor Zolotov boosted its numbers to a reported 400,000. Although he has no military background, the national guard has been given a broad array of tasks to control occupied areas of Ukraine behind the front line and is said to have sustained heavy losses. The UK's defence intelligence said that Russia's security forces ""and especially the national guard"" would be key to how the Prigozhin crisis would play out. Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin has the unenviable task of rescuing the economy, but has little say over the war. Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin and the head of Rosneft state oil giant, Igor Sechin, are also close to the president, according to political analyst Yevgeny Minchenko. Billionaire brothers Boris and Arkady Rotenberg, who were childhood friends of the president, have long been close confidants too. In 2020, Forbes magazine named them as the richest family in Russia.

Hawkish,"Pink, Queen and Alanis honour Taylor Hawkins in LA",2024-09-25,2022-09-28,By Mark Savage,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-63058731,"Musicians including Pink, Queen and Def Leppard have paid tribute to Foo Fighters drummer Taylor Hawkins at a memorial concert in Los Angeles. They joined the star's former bandmates in Foo Fighters and Chevy Metal to play the songs he loved, as fans celebrated his memory. Foos frontman Dave Grohl said the show honoured the fact that ""this many people connected through one person"". Other star guests included Miley Cyrus, Rush, Cars and Mötley Crüe. Alanis Morissette - for whom Hawkins played drums before he joined Foo Fighters - gave a fierce performance of You Oughta Know; while comedian Dave Chapelle unexpectedly covered Radiohead's Creep. Pink made several appearances during the concert, joining Heart's Nancy Wilson to duet on Barracuda, before tackling Queen's Somebody To Love - a song that Hawkins often covered in concert himself - and teaming up with Foo Fighters to sing The Pretender at the show's finale. British rock band Def Leppard recalled that they had first encountered Hawkins when he was a ""20-year-old kid"" working in a guitar shop in LA. ""About five years later we did Top Of The Pops in England [and] this kid walks into the dressing room. He was playing drums for Alanis Morissette,"" recalled singer Joe Elliot. ""That was Taylor Hawkins, so in memory of. Let's do some proper songs for Taylor.""  The band played Rock Of Ages before being joined briefly by pop star Miley Cyrus for an expansive version of Photograph. ""It's like a revolving door of rock heroes tonight,"" said Grohl halfway through the concert, which also saw performances from Skid Row's Sebastian Bach, Black Sabbath's Geezer Butler and Metallica's Lars Ulrich. One of the most moving moments came when the surviving members of Nirvana, Grohl and Krist Novoselic, teamed up with fellow grunge musicians Matt Cameron and Kim Thayil of Soundgarden - who lost their lead singer Chris Cornell five years ago. Together, they played haunting versions of The Day I Tried to Live and Black Hole Sun, with vocals from Taylor Momsen of the Pretty Reckless. Rush, who are also mourning the loss of their drummer Neil Peart, played Working Man with assistance from Red Hot Chili Pepper Chad Smith and YYZ with Danny Carey of Tool. And Wolfgang Van Halen delivered flawless renditions of his father's fretwork on covers of pop-metal classics Panama and Hot For Teacher. The concert came less than a month after a previous tribute show at Wembley Stadium in London, which saw Foo Fighters joined by Sir Paul McCartney, Liam Gallagher and Supergrass. As at that concert, Hawkins' children played a key role, with his teenage son Shane stepping behind the drum kit for a blistering rendition of the Foo Fighters' hits My Hero and I'll Stick Around. Hawkins' other children Everleigh and Annabel, also appeared on stage with their mother, Alison, after Queen's Brian May played Love Of My Life - a song that Alison had requested specially. Earlier, the show had opened with Grohl's daughter Violet giving a low-key, moving performance of Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah. Six hours later, Foo Fighters closed the show with Everlong. ""This one's for Taylor,"" Grohl told the audience at LA's Kia Forum. ""We love you."" Hawkins drummed with Foo Fighters from 1997 until his death in March of this year, aged 50. No cause of death was announced, although a toxicology report showed traces of 10 substances in his body, including opioids, marijuana and anti-depressants. Investigators did not say whether the mix of drugs was a factor. Proceeds from both the London and Los Angeles tribute concerts will go to the charities Music Support and MusiCares.

Nandi Bushell, from Ipswich, joined the band onstage and took Hawkins' place on the drum stool for Learn To Fly. Hawkins died earlier this year while the band were in South America.  Nandi said: ""It was amazing to play Wembley, but at the same time it was really sad."" She was one of many musicians to fill Hawkins' seat on Saturday in London, including Blink-182's Travis Barker, Foo Fighters' bandleader Dave Grohl and Hawkins' 16-year-old son, Shane. The young drummer, who goes to school in Ipswich, went viral after challenging Dave Grohl to a drum battle during lockdown. Grohl introduced her as ""one of the most badass drummers I've ever met in my life"". She met Hawkins last year, and performed the song at Wembley with a set of drumsticks he had given her.  Speaking on BBC Breakfast on Monday, she said: ""It was an incredible experience and so fun and exciting, but it was a tragedy that Taylor died because he was an amazing musician,"" she said. ""He was really warm and friendly and it's such a tragedy he died because he was just the nicest person.  ""It was so much fun. He was a role model ever since I was eight years old because I absolutely love the Foo Fighters. ""He was an amazing drummer."" Justin Hawkins from Lowestoft band The Darkness was at Wembley alongside Wolfgang Van Halen and Grohl to sing Van Halen's Hot For Teacher. And the frontman also joined Queen to sing Under Pressure, which featured Darkness drummer Rufus Taylor, who is the son of Queen drummer Roger Taylor. Eurovision runner-up Sam Ryder, from Maldon in Essex, also performed during the Queen section. He sang Somebody To Love - 30 years after George Michael sang it at the old Wembley for the 1992 Freddie Mercury tribute concert. Ryder praised the audience for their participation - writing ""when the crowd understands the assignment"" on an Instagram post. ""What a beautiful and moving celebration of such a wonderful human. Thank you for everything, Taylor,"" he wrote, ahead of announcing the release date for his debut album. Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

Hawkish,The Shape of Water leads Oscar nominations,2024-09-25,2018-01-23,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-42790624,"The nominations for the 90th Academy Awards have been announced, with The Shape of Water leading the field. Guillermo del Toro's fantasy romance received 13 nominations, including best picture. World War Two drama Dunkirk follows with eight nominations, while Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri received seven. British stars shortlisted include Gary Oldman, Sally Hawkins and a pair of Daniels - Day-Lewis and Kaluuya.  Greta Gerwig has landed a best director nomination for Lady Bird, one of nine films shortlisted for the best picture award. Others include Steven Spielberg's The Post, gay romance Call Me By Your Name and Winston Churchill drama Darkest Hour. Oldman's performance as Churchill has already won the British actor a Golden Globe and a Screen Actors Guild award. To win the Oscar, though, he will have to beat three-time best actor winner Sir Daniel Day-Lewis, nominated again for Phantom Thread. Meryl Streep's best actress nomination for newspaper drama The Post is her 17th for best actress and her 21st overall. The three-time Oscar winner said she was ""honoured beyond measure"" to be recognised for ""a film that stands in defence of press freedom and inclusion of women's voices in the movement of history"". Frances McDormand is tipped to be this year's winner for her role as a grieving mother in Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri. Two of McDormand's co-stars, Woody Harrelson and Sam Rockwell, go head to head in the best supporting actor category. The Shape of Water has also fared well in the acting categories, with nominations for Richard Jenkins and Octavia Spencer alongside Hawkins' best actress nod. Del Toro's film narrowly missed out on tying with the previous nomination record of 14, obtained by the films All About Eve, Titanic and La La Land. Diversity continues to be a hot topic in Hollywood, which has been rocked this year by sexual harassment scandals, concerns over gender pay equality and the role of women both in front of and behind the camera. These topics appear to have had an impact on this year's nominations, which are largely free of embarrassing exclusions and the kind of all-white line-ups that led to the #OscarsSoWhite campaign on social media. Greta Gerwig's nomination in the best director category will placate those who expressed displeasure at the Golden Globes' all-male directing nominees, even if she is only the fifth woman in history to be afforded that honour. And while there are no non-white performers up for best actress or best supporting actor, there are two black males up for best actor - Denzel Washington and Britain's Daniel Kaluuya - and another two shortlisted for best supporting actress. Jordan Peele's best director nomination for Get Out is also significant, given he is only the fifth black film-maker to be considered for the award. ""Right now I'm just thinking about everyone who bought a ticket and told someone else to,"" Peele tweeted in response to his film's four nominations. ""You did this."" Eight of this year's female acting contenders are aged over 40, while Christopher Plummer becomes the oldest man to be nominated for best supporting actor for All the Money in the World. Plummer, 88, took over the role of J Paul Getty in Sir Ridley Scott's film after the director decided to erase Kevin Spacey's performance as the US billionaire. At 89, meanwhile, Belgian director Agnes Varda - whose film Faces Places is up for best documentary feature - is believed to be the oldest Oscar nominee ever. Varda is a week older than fellow 89-year-old James Ivory, who has been nominated for writing Call Me By Your Name's screenplay. The Academy has recently strived to broaden the ethnic, age and gender make-up of its membership, which may have filtered through to this year's nominations. Yet the Academy still has a long way to go, as a comparison between male and female nominees in some of the key categories attests. Notable firsts include Rachel Morrison's best cinematography nomination for Mudbound, Netflix's drama about racial tension in Mississippi. Morrison, whose other credits include the forthcoming Black Panther, is the first woman ever to receive a nomination in this category. Mudbound's Mary J Blige also makes history by getting nominations for best supporting actress and best song in the same year. The nine-time Grammy winner co-wrote Mighty River for the film, which is also recognised for its adapted screenplay. Among those to miss out this year include James Franco, who had been tipped by some to get a best actor nod for The Disaster Artist. The US actor recently became the subject of sexual harassment allegations which may have hurt his chances of an Oscar nomination. London-born Martin McDonagh, Three Billboards' writer-director, is also a surprise omission from the best director line-up. Surprise nominees include Britain's Lesley Manville, up for playing Day-Lewis's sister in fashion-based period piece Phantom Thread. Paul Thomas Anderson's film, also up for best picture, best director and two other awards, did much better than many had expected. The nominations were announced in Los Angeles by British actor Andy Serkis and Girls Trip actress Tiffany Haddish. Jimmy Kimmel will return to host this year's ceremony, to be held on 4 March at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood. Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

Hawkish,Fans investigate #WhoBitBeyonce,2024-09-25,2018-03-27,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-43552605,"Beyonce fans are turning into amateur detectives after learning that she was apparently bitten on the face at a party. Actress Tiffany Haddish revealed details about the bizarre incident in an interview with GQ, but left the culprit unnamed. Two actresses have already had to deny being guilty following media speculation. Now fans are using #WhoBitBeyonce to track down the person responsible. Tiffany, who stars in Girls Trip, said she met Beyonce at a party in December last year. ""There was this actress there that's just, like, doing the mostest,"" she told GQ. ""She bit Beyonce in the face... So Beyonce stormed away, went up to Jay Z, and was like, 'Jay! Come here!' - and snatched him. ""They went to the back of the room. I was like, 'What just happened?'"" Beyonce's representatives told GQ they don't know anything about the incident with the actress, who Tiffany has not named. But that hasn't stopped the Beyhive from speculating wildly.  And celebrities have been wading in on the action too. Model Chrissy Teigen says she has her suspicions. Which led to a real rollercoaster ride.  Eventually, it appears, she discovered who it was.  The party took place after a Jay Z show on 22 December in Inglewood, California, according to Tiffany.  That bit of information led to The Cut drawing up a shortlist of potential suspects based on who they say was there.  Rihanna, James Franco, French Montana and Diddy were all supposedly there - and were all written off as innocent by the magazine. Tiffany said the culprit was an actress, leading to former 90210 star Sara Foster being mentioned.  Sara made it pretty clear it wasn't her.  Meanwhile Sanaa Lathan, star of Love & Basketball, has been the victim of bee emoji attacks - with the Beyhive posting them all over her Instagram.  She too says she's not the biter.  It looks like the speculation will continue. But in the meantime fans are having lots of fun with the memes. Beyonce and Jay Z recently announced their On The Run II tour, which comes to the UK later this year.  Follow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.

Hawkish,Couple receive £2.8m payout over stillborn baby,2024-09-25,2021-12-06,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-59541766,"A couple whose child died in the womb after mistakes by maternity staff have received a £2.8m settlement. Sarah Hawkins was in labour for six days before Harriet was stillborn at Nottingham City Hospital in April 2016.  It is believed to be the largest payout for a stillbirth clinical negligence case. A Nottingham University Hospitals (NUH) NHS Trust spokesperson said it had now introduced enhanced training on foetal monitoring. Mrs Hawkins was nearly 41 weeks' pregnant when Harriet was delivered, almost nine hours after dying. Hospital bosses initially found ""no obvious fault"" and the couple were told their child had died of an infection. Refusing to accept this the parents launched their own investigation. An external inquiry identified 13 failings in care. A Root Cause Analysis Investigation Report published in 2018 concluded the death was ""almost certainly preventable"". The report said errors included a delay in applying appropriate foetal monitoring, the important omission of information on an antenatal advice sheet and a failure to follow the Risk Management Policy for maternity. It also found failures to record or pass on information correctly, failure to follow correct guidelines and delays in administering the correct treatment. At the time, both parents both worked for Nottingham University Hospitals (NUH) NHS trust but due to the trauma of Harriet's death, neither felt able to return. Following the report's publication, the hospital trust apologised and said major changes would be made. Mrs Hawkins said: ""I couldn't grieve when [the trust] chose to say Harriet's death was caused by an infection, rather than their own failures.  ""We had to keep Harriet's body in the mortuary for two years so we could keep her as 'evidence'.  ""Time after time families are contacting us, and every single time I get contacted my heart sinks."" Mr Hawkins said: ""We have had to fight to be heard. We are, at long last, heard.  ""As too are many other families, yet sadly because there has been no proper accountability for such a long time now, there are many more yet to come forwards."" A spokesperson for NUH said: ""We would like to reiterate our sincere apologies to Mr and Mrs Hawkins for failures in the care around the delivery of baby Harriet.  ""Our Maternity Improvement Programme has introduced a number of improvements including better training and monitoring with renewed focus on the recruitment and retention of midwives and maternity teams to ensure that we offer the best services possible to every family in our care."" An investigation by Channel 4 News and the Independent earlier this year reported 46 babies had suffered brain damage and 19 were stillborn in Nottingham since 2010. The BBC found there have been at least seven preventable deaths of babies between 2015 and 2020. Both maternity services run by NUH have been rated as inadequate by the Care Quality Commission (CQC). Through a freedom of information request, BBC News learned there have been 34 maternity investigations following adverse incidents at NUH since 2018.  Janet Baker, from Switalskis Solicitors, which represented Mr and Mrs Hawkins, said: ""£2.8m is the highest damages award in a stillbirth case, with legal fees for both sides the total cost to the NHS is likely to be over £3.5m. ""I believe that this is a cost which was unnecessary and could have been avoided if NUH had acknowledged responsibility for Harriet's death straight away and had been open with Sarah and Jack.""

Hawkish,Drugs gang 'brought misery' to communities,2024-09-25,2020-02-04,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-51355785,"A gang member who police said brought ""misery"" to communities in south Devon has been jailed for 25 years for drugs and sex offences. James Brooks, 41, of Dawlish, was a member of a gang who got ""large sums of money"" from cocaine and cannabis. He was one of 13 gang members sentenced at Bristol Crown Court following offences committed during 2018/2019. Judge Michael Longman said the town ""changed for the better"" after the arrests.  Brooks, of Park Road, received the longest sentence of the 13 men, being handed 12 years for drugs offences, and 13 years for aiding and abetting 13 counts of rape. Devon and Cornwall Police said the group ""exerted significant influence and control within Dawlish and Teignmouth"" and ""used violence and coercive tactics to maintain a criminal empire valued at £1m"". Det Ch Insp Nick Wilden said some members had been a blight on communities for 10 years.   Officers seized a variety of weapons during their investigation, including firearms, knives and knuckledusters.  Seized mobile phone footage also showed them assaulting people over drug debts, police added. Sentencing after a four-month trial, Judge Longman said the men had ""made an unwelcome mark on the town to detriment of law-abiding individuals"".  He added there was ""no doubt"" Brooks was the ""prime mover of these conspiracies"".   Prosecutors also paid tribute to the courage of three rape victims who gave evidence against men who exploited them.   One man in the town, who wanted to remain anonymous because of fear of reprisals, told the BBC that there had been a ""definite atmosphere of fear"". He said: ""There was a seething undercurrent of, 'We don't want this here, but we don't know what to do about it'. ""It's [now] like a blight has been lifted."" As well as Brooks, those jailed included:  The 13th man: Lewis Williams, 20, of Springwood Avenue, Garston, Liverpool, was given a two-year sentence, suspended for two years, for conspiracy to supply cannabis and possession of Class A drugs with intent to supply."

Hawkish,Two gulls shot dead in 'senseless' airgun attack,2024-09-25,2022-06-18,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-somerset-61852243,"Two herring gulls have died following an airgun attack which the RSPCA has described as ""completely senseless"". The injured birds were discovered in the gardens of two properties in Friarn Avenue in Bridgwater.  One was already dead while the second was so badly injured it had to be put to sleep to prevent further suffering. RSPCA animal rescue officer, Alison Sparks, said: ""It beggars belief that people are callously targeting animals in this way."" X-rays taken at the RSPCA's West Hatch Wildlife Centre in Taunton confirmed that both of the birds had been shot with an airgun, with pellets clearly visible on the scans.    One of the birds was shot in the wing, while the other had a wound to the upper chest area. Gulls, their eggs and their nests, are protected by law and it is illegal to intentionally kill, take or injure them, except under licence. Ms Sparkes, who attended on Monday night, said: ""Both birds appear to have been deliberately shot and sustained horrible injuries as a result.  ""Sadly, completely senseless attacks like this are not an uncommon occurrence for RSPCA officers. Finding animals who have been subjected to cruelty like this is upsetting. ""It's very worrying that people are taking pot-shots at birds like this in a residential area, and I would urge anyone with information to contact the RSPCA.""  Last year the RSPCA received 454 calls about animals being shot, injured or killed with air guns, although the charity believes these numbers do not show the full extent of the problem. The charity said it wants to see stricter regulations around owning an air weapon in both England and Wales. Follow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Hawkish,China's love for the late Stephen Hawking,2024-09-25,2018-03-14,By Tessa Wong,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-43395650,"As the world mourns Prof Stephen Hawking, who has died aged 76, there has been a particular outpouring of emotion in China, where the visionary physicist was revered by scientists, students, the state and even boy band stars.  ""He will roam across the universe and its galaxies, and in the end will again become its brightest star,"" said one commenter on the Chinese microblogging network Weibo.  Another said: ""He belongs to the stars, and has returned home now."" Many people in China grew up reading Prof Hawking's seminal book A Brief History of Time - the circulation of the Chinese-language edition is reportedly second only to that of the English.  His 2006 visit to China was covered with breathless excitement, with state media comparing his appeal to that of Tom Cruise. And when he joined Weibo in 2016 - saying hello to ""my friends in China"" - he was met with a rapturous response, amassing millions of followers within hours. Prof Hawking was, of course, beloved around the world, but the adulation and respect he has always commanded in China is perhaps in another universe altogether. Scholars and academics have traditionally been held in high regard in Chinese culture, which also prizes a hard-striving and disciplined work ethic. Having overcome great odds in his life, he was seen as having these qualities in spades. ""We all admire his creativity and his spirit of research, despite the extreme difficulty of his physical situation,"" Tsinghua University professor Shing-tung Yau told the BBC.  Prof Yau, who helped to arrange Prof Hawking's visits to China, added: ""He was very friendly and was willing to explain physics to laymen. His smile attracted the attention of everybody... the Chinese are grateful for his generosity in spending time in China."" Prof Hawking also came along at a time when modern China began accelerating its scientific and space ambitions. Thus, a role model ideal for the Chinese state to champion emerged.  ""Hawking has near-superstar status in China, and the Chinese government preaches that scientific prowess is crucial to the country's future power,"" reads one report carried by state media in 2006. It also helped that he was generally not critical of China - at first - and was happy to play to the crowd.   ""I like Chinese culture, Chinese food and above all Chinese women. They are beautiful,"" he told his audience at an appearance during his last trip, while also praising the Chinese for being ""very clever"", ""hardworking"" and having ""achieved a lot in science and technology"". More recently, he delighted younger Chinese when he interacted online with another Weibo star. Wang Junkai, the lead singer of popular boy band TFBoys, had in November asked Hawking a question about interstellar migration, and Prof Hawking praised him for asking an ""excellent question"".  After news of his death emerged Wang posted on social media: ""You will forever belong to the universe and the stars. I will etch your teachings on my heart."" But in his later years Prof Hawking had some criticism, most notably for one of his greatest concerns - artificial intelligence. In a video appearance in Beijing last year, he warned China of the rise of powerful AI, saying ""we should do all we can to ensure that its [AI's] future development benefits us and our environment"". China is now one of the world's leaders in investing, developing and using AI technology, such as using facial recognition to catch criminals - and to keep a close eye on the population. But he also genuinely believed in China, particularly its younger generations and their power to change the world, and sometimes addressed them directly on Weibo.  In 2016 he wrote a special message of encouragement to Chinese students taking the important gaokao college entrance exam, telling them to ""be fearless"".  In his response to Wang, he praised China's millennials for being curious and thinking about the future. ""My hope is that as you pursue science and other ideas, this curiosity and confidence will continue,"" he wrote. And in one of his last posts on Weibo, he thanked his millions of followers. ""It has been an illuminating experience being able to communicate with all of you here. ""I look forward to seeing what the talent and inquisitiveness of the Chinese people achieves in the realms of science and space."" His obvious affection for China has perhaps intensified the sense of loss among young Chinese. Among the moving tributes written by a netizen and highlighted by state media was this: ""Born in the ordinary dust, returned to the stars above. ""I encountered this person when I was in secondary school. He told me of mankind's indestructible and legendary perseverance. He also unveiled to me the mysterious secrets of the universe's black holes. I listened to his prophecies, I accepted science's revelations. ""This person has disappeared from our blue Earth, he has gone to explore the universe he so yearned to see. Have a smooth journey, Stephen Hawking."" ""I'm scared,"" said another. ""[I've] Suddenly lost a sense of security about Earth."" Additional reporting by Lily Lee and Lulu Luo"
Hawkish,Ammonia attack street robbers jailed,2024-09-25,2017-10-13,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-41614278,"Three men who attacked a shopkeeper with undiluted ammonia, leaving him blind in one eye, have been jailed. Neil Warner, 59, was taking more than £5,000 in cash to the post office in Dawlish, Devon, when he was attacked. Rikki Ward, 28, and Paul Rowntree, 37, were sentenced at Exeter Crown Court to more than 11 years each for robbery and causing grievous bodily harm with intent. Getaway driver Ross Morton, 29, got three years for assisting an offender. Ward and Rowntree lay in wait and attacked Mr Warner as he carried the weekend takings from the Costcutter store in the town. Ward squirted industrial strength ammonia in his eyes while Rowntree grabbed the money. Mr Warner only escaped total blindness because a nearby optician washed some of the liquid away. Morton then drove the masked robbers to Torquay where they spent £300 in a sport shop. Ward, of Chatham Road, Sunderland, admitted robbery and causing grievous bodily harm with intent and was jailed for 11 years and three months. Rowntree, of Oswald Street, Sunderland, but who was staying at Exeter Road, Dawlish, denied the charges but was convicted of the same offences and jailed for 15 years. Morton, of Gatehouse Close, Dawlish, but originally from Sunderland, was found guilty of assisting an offender and jailed for three years. Judge Geoffrey Mercer told Ward and Rowntree: ""Apart from the excruciating pain, he has effectively lost the sight of his right eye and the effect on his life has been vast, it has changed his life forever. ""You are both dangerous offenders.""  After the case Det Insp Mike Jones from Devon and Cornwall Police, said: ""I can only hope that the sentences that these men receive goes some way to helping him (Mr Warner) recover from this attack."""
Hawkish,Exe Estuary Trail section to close for repairs,2024-09-25,2023-07-29,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-66336353,"Part of a popular cycling and walking route around a Devon estuary will be shut for three months.  The boardwalk section, connecting Lympstone and Exmouth on the Exe Estuary Trail, needed urgent repairs, said Devon County Council. The timber Courtlands section was to be replaced after rotting with a durable fibre-reinforced material, it said. The closure would start in late September and it would let users know about diversions, it added. Pedestrians would be able to use the footpath on Exeter Road, but a spokesperson for the council said cyclists would need to cross over Exeter Road and ""follow the slightly longer route which avoids cycling on the main busy road"". They added: ""A temporary crossing will be located next to the petrol station to provide an additional safe crossing for this route."" The Exe Estuary Trail was completed by the council in 2014 and offers a 16-mile (26km), virtually traffic-free route around the estuary from Dawlish to Exmouth, said the Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS).  According to the Exe Estuary Management Partnership, it is used by more than 200,000 people each year. Follow BBC News South West on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

Hawkish,Vet dresses as giant mouse to calm dog,2024-09-25,2018-12-14,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-46564424,"A vet has dressed up as a giant mouse in order to examine a nervous rescue dog. Rupert the Dalmatian needed specialist orthopaedic surgery at Davies Veterinary Specialists in Hitchin but growled when vets tried to touch him. To calm his nerves, vet Mike Farrell donned a mouse onesie sent by his owner to comfort him which allowed Rupert to be ""examined safely"".  Rupert is now recovering from surgery to treat a cruciate ligament rupture. Sonya Schiff from London said she adopted him from The Dogs Trust a couple of years ago and it took a year for him to bond with her due to some ""serious guarding issues and aggression"". Rupert also had separation anxiety if she left him and he was also occasionally lame and very protective about his legs. The dog was diagnosed with hip dysplasia and cruciate ligament problems and referred to orthopaedic specialist Mr Farrell for surgery.  ""I was really worried about him going into hospital and thought he might benefit from having the scent and sense of me with him,"" Ms Schiff said. ""I thought the mouse romper suit, which I often wear at home to relax in would make a reassuring bed for him in the kennels.""  Mr Farrell said the veterinary surgery did not usually allow bedding from home but in this case they thought ""it had the potential to help Rupert a lot"". However, when the dog growled at him when he was wearing his normal clothes he decided to go a step further and put on the giant mouse outfit.  Dog behaviourist Monika Kafno said: ""A dog's bedding or favourite toy brought into unfamiliar environment will have a calming and settling effect as it will be a scent associated with comfort and home life."""
Hawkish,Sea wall to secure line 'for 100 years',2024-09-25,2019-05-31,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-48472901,"Work is beginning on a £30m scheme to protect a coastal railway line that washed into the sea five years ago. A new 25ft (7.5m) high sea wall is being built at Dawlish, Devon after the line collapsed during storms on 4 February 2014. The track which links Devon and Cornwall with the rest of the country was left dangling in the air after waves gouged out holes in the defences. Network Rail aims to ""secure the future of the line for the next 100 years"". Here is all you need to know about the Dawlish sea wall improvement scheme, from the Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS). Phase one starts on 1 June with site preparation work. Work on the concrete foundations starts on Monday and will last until 14 July when there will be a break until 9 September to avoid disruption during the summer. The scheduled finish date is 23 January 2020. To raise the height of the sea wall from 5m (16ft) to 7.5m. The walkway will also be raised and widened to 4m (13ft) from 3.1m (10ft), with a safety barrier. To protect the line from closure and to reduce flooding of the track by 90%. Network Rail points to forecasts of a sea level rise of 0.8m (3ft) in the next 100 years.  Western route managing director Mark Langman, said: ""world leading engineers"" had designed the plans to ""ensure the railway line is more resilient to extreme weather and rising sea levels for generations to come"". The main construction of the sea wall will begin. Pre-cast concrete panels will be installed, track drainage put in and existing promenade sections will be demolished with pre-cast concrete units installed. Surfacing work will take place on the promenade with lighting and seating. New concrete panels will clad the existing wall and this will be filled in with concrete. Ramps will connect the new raised promenade to the existing walkway levels at Colonnade underbridge and Boat Cove. Round the clock. Typically work will start five hours before and finish five hours after low tide. Work will be carried out six days a week, but these days will be selected to maximise spring tide working. For the duration of the work, there will be no car parking spaces available in Marine Parade, with the parking bays suspended. This will enable them to be used by construction staff to enable the delivery of vital materials. The parking suspension on Marine Parade will begin on 3 June. Where possible, ""as much access to the beach in front of Marine Parade will be retained for public use"" says Network Rail. During phase one, public access to Boat Cove will be maintained via the footbridge over the railway line, with a pedestrian walkway installed from the footbridge through Boat Cove to Coryton Cove."
Hawkish,Ipswich Town 1-0 Crewe Alexandra,2024-09-25,2020-10-31,BBC Sport,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/54671143,"Oli Hawkins' first goal for Ipswich was enough to beat Crewe and move the Tractor Boys into second place in League One. The 6ft 5in striker, who signed from Portsmouth on a free transfer in the summer, headed home Alan Judge's superb cross after 62 minutes to seal the three points at Portman Road. Crewe enjoyed an excellent first half but were unable to beat Town goalkeeper Tomas Holy, who made several outstanding saves to deny the visitors. Alex started the game brightly and Holy was called into an early save from Luke Offord's header after Harry Pickering whipped in a dangerous free-kick from the left. The visitors tested Holy again after 13 minutes when Owen Dale's fierce strike from the right was parried away by the Town keeper. The Czech goalkeeper then produced a miraculous stop to deny the Railwaymen after half an hour when he blocked Tom Lowery's effort from point-blank range following Dale's cut-back. Ipswich improved after the break and Stephen Ward's cross after 56 minutes found Hawkins but the striker's header was smothered by Will Jaaskelainen. But Hawkins did find the net for Ipswich six minutes later when he headed home Judge's teasing delivery from the left. Holy made another smart save to deny Offord after 68 minutes, and Ipswich withstood some late pressure to secure the win. Report supplied by PA Media League One official site"
Hawkish,Clean-up operation under way after Devon flash floods,2024-09-25,2023-09-18,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-66842486,"A clean-up operation is under way after torrential rain flooded homes, roads and businesses in Devon.  Roads were submerged and fire crews had to help people to safety in Kenton near Exeter on Sunday.  In Somerset, Butlin's resort in Minehead has been closed due to flood damage. Yellow rain warnings are in place for parts of north-west England and Wales for Tuesday and Wednesday. On Sunday, Exeter Airport was forced to close when the terminal flooded. The airport has since reopened. Exeter was one of the wettest places in the country on Sunday with 63.8mm of rain recorded, said the Met Office. In Somerset, a number of businesses were flooded and many roads were closed in Minehead. Part of the car park at IKEA in Exeter was flooded after the heavy rain but the store remained open. There were also reports of flooding at the South Devon School of Gymnastics in Paignton and the Passage House Inn in Topsham. The rain led to widespread road closures and bus and train cancellations. People in one south Devon village came together to rescue an elderly woman who was trapped in an upstairs bedroom in her home following the floods. Some 50 villagers helped 95-year-old Betty Baldwin when the ground floor of her home in Harberton, near Totnes, flooded in the early hours. Neighbour Jonathan Bean climbed through a window to come to Ms Baldwin's aid. Ms Baldwin said she was woken up in the middle of the night by the sound of ""an awful lot of water, like the sea"". The pensioner went to her window and shouted out: ""I can't get out! I can't get out! I'm just so frightened.  ""Help me please!"" Mr Bean told BBC Radio Devon the water came up over his knees when he entered Ms Baldwin's home at about 02:50 BST . He said the furniture was floating everywhere and he had to wade through it to try to comfort Ms Baldwin.  He said: ""She was distressed, very distressed."" The pensioner, who will be 96 in two weeks, waited in bed until she could be moved to the safety of a neighbour's house. It is a massive clean-up - there is mud and mess everywhere. On Saturday night and Sunday there were torrents of water coming down with 20 homes flooded, some with water and mud up to chest height. There were 1,000 lightning strikes across the region on Sunday, and about one month's rain fell in just six hours. Betty was trapped upstairs late on Saturday night and the water was about 2ft 6ins (76cm) high. She is now staying with friends in the village, but is in high spirits and hopes the authorities will find her somewhere she can move to in the next few days. An Environment Agency spokesperson said: ""On Sunday, following a period of intense heavy rainfall, flood water on the Yeolands Stream exceeded the capacity of third party-owned culverts in Harbertonford and spilled into the overland flow route, which is maintained by the Environment Agency.  ""The system was overwhelmed and around eight properties were flooded. Our operations teams were out overnight clearing the overland flow route.  ""Agency community information officers were also on site conducting reconnaissance and engaging with the local community."" Harbertonford is about 1.7 miles (2.7km) south of Harberton. Torrential rain and lighting also hit communities and businesses in Dawlish, Torquay, Topsham and Exeter. In Kenton the primary school was closed on Monday as it was also affected by the flooding.

Hawkish,Iran 'choosing dangerous path' over tanker seizure,2024-09-25,2019-07-20,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-49054586,"Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has expressed his ""extreme disappointment"" in a phone call with his Iranian counterpart following the seizure of a British-flagged tanker in the Gulf. It comes after Mr Hunt warned Iran may be choosing a ""dangerous path"" of ""illegal and destabilising"" behaviour. The Stena Impero's owners have been unable to contact the ship, which was surrounded in the Strait of Hormuz. Iran said the vessel was ""violating international maritime rules"". In the call, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif told Mr Hunt the ship must now go through a legal process, according to the Iranian news agency ISNA. A second British-owned Liberian-flagged tanker, the MV Mesdar, was also boarded by armed guards but was released on Friday. The Stena Impero was seized by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard on Friday in a key waterway in the Gulf. The tanker was surrounded by four vessels and a helicopter before heading into Iranian waters, Mr Hunt said. ""We are not looking at military options,"" he said. ""We are looking at a diplomatic way to resolve this situation."" A senior Iranian diplomat was summoned to the Foreign Office in London following the ship's seizure. Mr Hunt confirmed he had spoken to his Iranian counterpart on Saturday afternoon. He said he expressed ""extreme disappointment that having assured me last Saturday Iran wanted to de-escalate the situation they have behaved in the opposite way."" He also tweeted: ""Yesterday's action in Gulf shows worrying signs Iran may be choosing a dangerous path of illegal and destabilising behaviour after Gibraltar's legal detention of oil bound for Syria."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has also demanded the release of the tanker and its crew, urging all sides to ""show restraint"". He added in a tweet: ""Trump tearing up the Iran nuclear deal has fuelled confrontation."" Another emergency Cobra committee meeting is due to be held later. Iran's state-run IRNA news agency said the tanker was seized after it collided with a fishing boat and failed to respond to calls from the smaller craft. The vessel's owners said it was fully complying with regulations and was in international waters when it was approached. Stena Bulk said the 23 crew members, who are Indian, Russian, Latvian and Filipino, were in good health. It said it was preparing a formal request to visit those onboard the seized ship. A UK government spokeswoman told the BBC: ""We have advised UK shipping to stay out of the area for an interim period."" Iran's foreign minister Javad Zarif tweeted that the UK ""must cease being an accessory to #EconomicTerrorism of the US"". He said it was Iran that guarantees the security of the Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz.  ""Unlike the piracy in the Strait of Gibraltar, our action in the Persian Gulf is to uphold international maritime rules,"" he said. Abbasali Kadkhodaei, spokesman of the state watchdog the Guardian Council, said on Twitter that ""the law of retaliation is a recognised concept in international law"" shortly after the ship's seizure was announced. The latest developments come amid a deterioration in relations between Iran and the UK and US. Tensions between the US and Iran have risen sharply since April, when the US tightened sanctions it had reimposed on Iran after unilaterally withdrawing from a 2015 nuclear deal. The US blamed Iran for attacks on tankers in the world's key shipping area since May. Tehran denies all the accusations. On Friday, the US claimed to have destroyed an Iranian drone in the Gulf. Unlike the US, the UK government remains committed to the landmark nuclear deal, which curbs Iran's nuclear activities in return for the lifting of sanctions tensions. However, the UK infuriated Iran after its Royal Marines helped seize an Iranian tanker off Gibraltar earlier this month. On Friday, Gibraltar granted a 30-day extension to allow authorities to continue detaining the tanker, which was suspected of carrying oil to Syria in breach of EU sanctions. In retaliation for the seizure of Grace 1, Iran threatened to seize a British oil tanker. A week later, Iranian boats attempted to impede a British oil tanker in the region before being warned off by a Royal Navy ship, according to the Ministry of Defence. Iran denied any attempted seizure. Since then, the threat level to British shipping in Iranian waters in the Gulf has remained at ""critical"". A White House National Security Council spokesman said the latest incident was the second time in just over a week the UK had been ""the target of escalatory violence"" by Iran.  US President Donald Trump has responded to the developments by saying he would talk to the UK. And US Central Command said it was developing a multinational maritime effort in response to the situation. The US military said it wanted to promote maritime stability, ensure safe passage, and de-escalate tensions in international waters throughout the Arabian Gulf, Strait of Hormuz, the Bab el-Mandeb Strait and the Gulf of Oman. France and Germany called on the Iranian authorities to quickly release the Stena Impero. Germany's foreign ministry condemned the ""unjustifiable intrusion"" on shipping through the route, adding that the seizure ""further exacerbates an already strained situation"". The French foreign ministry warned that the ship's seizure ""harms the needed de-escalation of tensions"" in the region. Also calling for the release of the ship, the European Union's foreign affairs office, which represents 28 member states, expressed ""deep concern"" and urged for ""restraint to avoid further tensions"". The first thing to remember is that this specific row between Tehran and London is only one aspect of an already highly volatile situation in the Gulf. The Trump administration's decision to walk away from the international nuclear deal with Iran and to re-apply sanctions is having a hugely damaging impact on the Iranian economy. Iran is pushing back. Given the highly fragile and volatile situation in the Gulf, together with the desperate need to bolster the flagging Iran nuclear deal, was it sensible to detain the vessel carrying Iranian oil off Gibraltar? Ships must fly the flag of a nation state, explains Richard Meade, managing editor of maritime intelligence publication Lloyd's List. They must be registered in a country, but that doesn't have to be the same country as its owners, or have any relation to the cargo, he says. But there must be some link to the UK. ""But how you define UK is relative,"" Mr Meade says. The Stena Impero is Swedish-owned and those on board are Indian, Russian, Latvian and Filipino. But it's the UK flag that is important symbolically, he says. ""Historically speaking it means that the UK owes protection to the vessel."" ""The UK has political responsibilities to anything that is flagged. And that's why it's much more serious than if there just happened to be a British captain on board."" He emphasises that while it was a political issue, the impact on trade in the region had so far been minimal. But he warns that if the international community began viewing the Strait of Hormuz as a dangerous place to be, that could create a ""very different"" scenario. The defence, intelligence and diplomatic figures attending the government's Cobra crisis meetings over Iran are facing a tricky dilemma. Clearly, British-flagged or owned shipping in the Gulf needs protecting but the Royal Navy does not have enough surface ships to do the job alone. So this would have to be part of a multinational force like the proposed Operation Sentinel being discussed by US Central Command. The US Navy has plenty of ships in the Gulf - its powerful 5th Fleet is headquartered in Bahrain - but here lies the problem. Britain and its EU partners are not on the same page as Washington when it comes to the wider policy of dealing with Iran. The US has pulled out of the nuclear deal, while Europe is trying to keep it alive. So there is a reluctance by some on this side of the Atlantic to be identified too closely with a hawkish US posture towards Iran or take any actions that may be interpreted as escalating an already volatile situation.

Hawkish,Oscars: From Hollyoaks to Hollywood,2024-09-25,2018-03-05,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-43287786,"For ex-Hollyoaks stars Rachel Shenton and Chris Overton, the fairytale is just beginning. Having picked up the Oscar for best live action short film, a LOT of doors are about to open for the pair. Rachel acted in, and was the creative force behind, The Silent Child while Chris, her fiance, directed it. But they're not the only Hollyoaks stars who've gone on to bigger and better things. As fans of the soap will know, Rachel played Mitzeee Minniver in the Channel 4 soap while Chris played the role of cage fighter Liam McAllister. And while they're getting the headlines right now, they're following in some pretty big Hollyoaks footsteps. Nathalie played the role of Sasha Valentine from 2006 to 2010 before moving on to HBO smash Game of Thrones as Missandai. She's evolved into one of the drama's biggest characters, as right hand woman to Daenerys Targaryen, and Nathalie has also had roles in The Maze Runner film series as well as Furious 7. Ricky originally found fame in an advert for Reebok back in 2000 before moving on to play Calvin Valentine (Sasha's brother btw) in the Chester-based soap for five years. Not only did he step into the sequined world of Strictly Come Dancing (2009) to come a very respectable second, he's since scored a major role in American Gods. Made by US cable network Starz, the show - based on author Neil Gaiman's fantasy novel - has just been commissioned for a second series. Ok, we're stretching this one a bit but the current king of US Saturday night TV had a guest spot on Hollyoaks back in 2000. He played school caretaker Wayne but has since described his brief time on the show as ""hell on earth"". Since then he's won Tony Awards, an OBE and taken over the world with The Late, Late Show and, of course, Carpool Karaoke. Warren Brown helped cut his acting teeth on Hollyoaks playing the sinister Andy Holt. Not only did the character commit a series of rapes but he got involved with kidnap and drugs too. Warren though has gone from strength to strength since his time on the show in the mid-2000s. Playing DS Justin Ripley in Luther, as well as major roles in a number of dramas (Inside Men, Homefront and Good Cop) has confirmed his status as a major TV star.

Hawkish,Farmer jailed for 'hair-trap' death,2024-09-25,2018-11-06,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-46111935,"A farmer who caused the death of a young woman by failing to replace a £75 cover on the drive shaft of a milling machine has been jailed. Lauren Scott, 20, died after her hair and clothes got caught in the machine at Springfield Farm near Dawlish, Devon, in March last year. Neil Carpenter, 45, was found guilty of manslaughter by gross negligence. Sentencing him to four-and-a-half years, Judge Mr Justice Dingemans said Carpenter lied about what happened. The court heard the milling machine was powered by a power takeoff (PTO) - a drive shaft attached to a tractor. They were told PTOs should have a plastic cover, costing £75, but in this case the tubing had been broken and dented, leaving parts of the rotating shaft uncovered. See more news from Devon Mr Justice Dingemans said it was clear that Carpenter, who denied allowing Miss Scott to use the machine, had started operating the PTO and mill and that Miss Scott had taken over ""in her normal helpful way"". He said: ""I accept your remorse is genuine and that you attempted to assist Miss Scott after this dreadful entanglement. ""No sentence I pass will reflect the loss suffered.""  He added Carpenter had ""not processed"" the risk posed by the broken PTO and that his decision not to replace it was not motivated by cost saving. The traffic warden and part-time farmer previously admitted two breaches of health and safety regulations by failing to ensure Miss Scott's safety on that day, 4 March 2017, and in relation to two other volunteers in 2015. He was sentenced to 10 months to be served concurrently for those offences. After Carpenter was found guilty, Miss Scott's family said: ""The presence of a £75 PTO cover would have ensured Lauren to still be with us today. ""Let this ruling be a message to every person working within the agriculture industry.  ""Your health and safety in the workplace matters."""

Hawkish,Hawking rings etched with landowner's name found,2024-09-25,2023-04-16,By Katy Prickett,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-norfolk-65276638,"Two 17th Century silver hawking rings unearthed by metal detectorists have been linked to a Norfolk gentry family, research has revealed. One was engraved with the name John Rychers and the second John Riches. They were found at Swannington, where the Richers family lived. Historian Helen Geake said it was not unusual in this era for someone to ""style their name in different ways"". The finds date to just before falconry ""died out as a popular pursuit"". The Richers lived at Swannington Hall from the 15th Century onwards and would have used the hawking rings, known as vervels, to identify ownership of the birds if they were found dead or flew off. Dr Geake, who is the Norfolk finds liaison officer, said: ""While the Richers aren't at the top echelons of society, hawking seems to have been an affordable way of showing off that you're part of the gentry."" A ""tiny, tiny"" 17th Century silver hawking whistle with a Norwich maker's mark has also been found by a detectorist at Hockering, about eight miles (13km) away. Dr Geake said: ""I can imagine the owner having it on a little chain attached to his outfit and then whistling in his hawk to get it back."" She said the finds were evidence of how extensive aristocratic hawking was just before it ""died out as a popular pursuit and the sport almost, but not quite, disappeared"". The massive increase in firearms during the English Civil Wars, between 1642 and 1651, helped bring about its end. It was much easier to shoot game for the kitchen than train a hawk for the purpose. All three items, which were discovered in 2021 and 2022, have been declared treasure by a coroner and Norwich Castle Museum hopes to acquire them.

Hawkish,Rhodes evacuation 'like something from a film',2024-09-25,2023-07-25,By Alex Green,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-66300544,"A woman from Devon who is in Rhodes with her family said being evacuated from their hotel was ""terrifying"". Amy Walker and her family, from Dawlish, left their hotel late on Saturday, joining thousands ""scrambling"" to get on to boats. Ms Walker, her mother, and her two children - aged one and 10 - are due to fly to Bristol later. About 19,000 people have been evacuated from the Greek island since Tuesday. Speaking to BBC Radio Devon, Ms Walker said: ""We watched the smoke from the fires... all day on Saturday. ""You know, it was a real concern, I'd packed my bag by lunch time, I wanted to go but we were advised to stay in the hotel where there was food and electricity. ""We were reassured everything was OK, and the situation just got worse."" Ms Walker said of leaving the hotel: ""It was terrifying, it was like something out of a film. ""Everyone was scrambling and then we had to just ditch our luggage on the road, and walk down to the beach where there was thousands of people in the dark."" She said: ""People were scrambling to get on boats, like small RIBs that the locals had put on, at this point there was no government boats there. ""I just had to like take a minute, and we sat back, and I said 'I can't get on one of those boats, they look like they're about to sink', and we sat there for half an hour, 45 minutes before we mustered up the courage to go and get on one - more boats had come, some Navy RIBs."" Ms Walker said while trying to board one of the RIBs, a woman tried to push her from the ladder. ""She tried to push me off the ladder of the naval boat and I'd got a baby in a carrier strapped to me, she wanted to get on that ladder herself, and she was trying to do anything to get on it and save herself,"" she said.  Ms Walker said she and her family managed to get on to one of the Navy RIBs safely, which took them to a ferry further out to sea. She said they were taken to the city of Rhodes and she was grateful to have been taken in by a Greek family, and that she and her family were ""being looked after"".

Hawkish,Thousands sign Hawking condolence books,2024-09-25,2018-03-24,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-43504939,"Thousands of people from around the world have signed condolence books in the wake of the death of renowned theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking. Prof Hawking, who had motor neurone disease, died on 14 March, aged 76, at his home in Cambridge. Condolence books at Gonville & Caius College have been signed by more than 2,780 people, with more than 600 people paying tribute in an online version. College master Prof Sir Alan Fersht said it was ""moved"" by the response. Hawking had been a fellow at Gonville & Caius, part of the University of Cambridge, for more than 50 years. The college said that after Prof Hawking's death so many people wanted to sign the original condolence book they had to bring in three more.  They will be bound together and presented to his family at a later date, it added. ""All of us at Gonville & Caius have been much moved by the extraordinary response to Stephen's death,"" said Prof Fersht. ""We're glad we have also offered the chance to send messages via a virtual condolence book, prompting messages from China, India, Malaysia, Australia and more.  ""It has been an honour for the college to be a focus for tributes to Stephen."" A private funeral service will take place at Great St Mary's, the University Church on 31 March, Prof Hawking's family said. His ashes will be interred at Westminster Abbey later this year."
Hawkish,Why Merkel may help fund Europe's virus recovery,2024-09-25,2020-05-27,By Jenny Hill,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-52807748,"Last year, in the sumptuous setting of Aachen's historic town hall, Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron signed a treaty. The leaders promised to co-operate more closely and to re-fire the political and economic heart of the EU, sealing the deal with a kiss for the cameras.  How times have changed.  Their attempts to jointly reform, reinvigorate and reinforce the EU against the deep currents of populism and the shock of the UK's departure have, thus far, not amounted to much; the German chancellor apparently reluctant to lend her weight to the French president's imagined agenda for Europe.  But last week they announced another Franco-German plan. There could be no public display of affection this time as, via separate video links, the leaders unveiled their economic recovery proposal for a corona-ravaged Europe. The EU Commission, they said, should borrow €500bn ($545bn; £448bn) from the financial markets to fund the venture.   Unable to stand physically shoulder to shoulder, Mr Macron and Mrs Merkel had, nonetheless, thrashed out a compromise that took many analysts by surprise - not least because it represents a significant shift in position on the part of the German chancellor. The German leader has always resisted the mutualisation of EU debt.  The idea that richer member states should be responsible for the debts and defaults of poorer ones has not played well in Berlin, where the idea of ""coronabonds"", so vociferously demanded by a number of member states, had ministers spluttering into their coffee.  This proposal differs, but still centres on the sharing of debt.  The money, which will be doled out in the form of grants, will sit within - and be repaid out of - the EU budget, with each country shouldering the repayment proportionate to their existing contribution to the pot.  Germany as the biggest net contributor will therefore be liable to pay back more.  Not everyone is happy. Italy says the plan needs to be more ambitious, while four other countries, including Austria, want the aid to be in loans not grants. The head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, will put forward the EU's own proposals on how the recovery fund and a revamped budget might work on Wednesday. Mrs Merkel's apparent change of heart is an indication of her alarm at where the EU might be headed, post-Brexit.  German politicians have been taken aback by the recent level of hostility coming out of Italy and they are spooked by the prospect of populists in Southern European states making gains on the back of the coronavirus crisis.  It was no accident that Mr Macron talked about learning the lessons of the financial crisis when he said Europe's response exacerbated inequality and damaged European sovereignty. Mrs Merkel, edging towards the end of her final term next year, is looking to legacy and has made clear in recent speeches that she's focused on getting the bloc into shape.  Some say that a recent ruling of Germany's constitutional court may have spurred her on. The court has called into question the future of a huge European Central Bank bond-buying stimulus programme. She's also striking while the political iron is hot at home. Her handling of the pandemic has sent her own approval ratings soaring along with those of her party.   And, as Mrs Merkel is fond of repeating, ""Germany only prospers when the EU prospers."" The Franco-German proposal has gone down well with the domestic audience. Public surveys suggest Germans have warmed to the idea.  It helps that, as the Berlin-based German Institute for Economic Research has noted in interviews, Germany wouldn't be directly responsible were another state to go bankrupt, and that this plan does not represent joint liability. There's been remarkably little bite-back politically, with even her hawkish former Finance Minister, Wolfgang Schäuble reportedly giving the plan the thumbs-up.  Coronavirus has changed a great deal here, with politicians recently agreeing to abandon a long-cherished principle of not taking on new debt in order to finance a domestic economic rescue package.  Not that the fully developed plans won't be closely scrutinised. Katja Leikert, the deputy chair of Mrs Merkel's CDU-CSU parliamentary group, welcomed the initiative as ""a significant political gesture to help rebuild political trust on the future of Europe"". But crucially, given that the money would be disbursed as grants to regions and industries deemed to be most affected by the crisis, Ms Leikert says that ""conditionality will also be very important"". She says, for example, that the fund should be used to ""enable future investments... in digitalisation or transformation to a sustainable economy"". And while she notes that among voters she finds ""huge support for European solutions in the time of the crisis"", Ms Leikert adds that this is limited and says ""we have to make sure that increased public spending on the European level will create a European added value"". Europe's so-called ""frugal four"" continue to object to the plan, concerned that it might set a future precedent.  The leaders of Austria, Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands may have heard Mrs Merkel say this was a one-off instrument for extraordinary times but, publicly at least, they don't believe her.  They'll be under huge pressure to fall in, now that the bloc's two weightiest members have agreed on a plan that co-ordinates beautifully - some would say suspiciously so - with the wishes of Ursula von der Leyen.  It was no accident that, before Covid-19's deathly advance across the medieval courtyards and traffic-clogged avenues of Europe, Mrs Merkel and Mr Macron chose to hold that summit in Aachen.  Nearby, in its cathedral, lie the remains of Charlemagne, the warrior king who first united - not always diplomatically - much of what we recognise as Europe today. Having been apparently content to simply invoke an ancient ghost last year, it could be that finally France and Germany are together ready for action."
Hawkish,China media calls on British Museum to return artefacts,2024-09-25,2023-08-28,By Fan Wang,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-66636705,"A call for the British Museum to return Chinese artefacts after the recent alleged theft of about 2,000 items is heating up social media in the country. The demand became the most trending topic on Weibo after an editorial in a state-run nationalist newspaper. In the piece published on Sunday night, Global Times asked the museum to give back all Chinese cultural relics ""free of charge"". The Chinese government has not commented on the issue yet. The BBC has reached out to the British Museum for comment but is yet to hear back. The museum has been under pressure after around 2,000 items were reported ""missing, stolen or damaged"" two weeks ago. A member of staff was sacked when the news first came out. Last week, its director Hartwig Fischer also announced he would step down. In its article, Global Times argued that the world-renowned museum has failed to take good care of ""cultural property belonging to other countries"". ""The huge loopholes in the management and security of cultural objects in the British Museum exposed by this scandal have led to the collapse of a long-standing and widely circulated claim that 'foreign cultural objects are better protected in the British Museum',"" the editorial reads. The British Museum has the biggest collection of Chinese antiquities in the West. According to its website, it has about 23,000 Chinese objects, spanning from the Neolithic age to the present. These include a large range of precious items such as paintings, prints, jade, bronzes and ceramics. One of the most famous is the reproduction of a scroll called ""Admonitions of the Instructress to the Court Ladies"", a masterpiece considered a milestone in Chinese art history.  This is not the first time Chinese netizens have called on the British Museum to return artefacts in recent years amid a rise in nationalist sentiment. But the editorial on the suspected thefts has sparked more conversation this time around. The hashtag  ""The British Museum please return Chinese antiquities"" topped Weibo's search chart until noon local time on Monday. It has been viewed more than half a billion times. ""Return the objects to their original owner,"" a comment liked by more than 32,000 times reads. ""Now that the country is rich and the people are strong, it's time to have our treasures back home,"" another top comment says. While tens of thousands support Global Times' request, some others were not as impressed. ""Why don't you make a trip to the UK for our treasures? Just shouting on Weibo domestically is just playing safe and shameless,"" a post liked by more than 10,000 times says.  The Global Times, known for its hawkish views, has led the charge in publishing English-language editorials attacking the West, particularly in recent years amid China's deteriorating relationship with the West.  It is not clear whether the Chinese government will take any action following the calls. But asking the museum to return artefacts is a sentiment not limited to China.  Following reports that artefacts had been stolen, other countries have also said the British Museum can no longer be trusted with their antiquities. The Greek government, which has been asking for the return of the Parthenon Sculptures, also known as the Elgin Marbles, renewed those calls this week. Greece's Minister of Culture, Lina Mendoni was quoted as saying that the security questions raised by the missing objects ""reinforces the permanent and just demand of our country for the definitive return"" of the Elgin marbles. Nigerian officials have also called on the museum to return the Benin Bronzes taken from the Benin kingdom that now lies within its territory.  Tim Loughton MP, the Conservative chairman of the all party parliamentary group for the museum, has called such demands ""opportunistic"". He told the BBC that other countries should be ""rallying around to help retrieve objects instead of trying to take advantage""."
Hawkish,Hawking's warnings: What he predicted about the future,2024-09-25,2018-03-15,By Paul Rincon,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-43408961,"Stephen Hawking's fame was founded on the research he did on general relativity and black holes. But he often stepped outside his own field of research, using his recognition to highlight what he saw as the great challenges and existential threats for humanity in coming decades. His pronouncements drove headlines in the media, which sometimes proved controversial.  Hawking was clearly troubled that we were putting all our eggs in one basket - that basket being Earth. For decades, Hawking had been calling for humans to begin the process of permanently settling other planets. It made news headlines again and again. Hawking's rationale was that humankind would eventually fall victim to an extinction-level catastrophe - perhaps sooner rather than later. What worried him were so-called low-probability, high impact events - a large asteroid striking our planet is the classic example.  But Hawking perceived a host of other potential threats: artificial intelligence, climate change, GM viruses and nuclear war to name a few. In 2016, he told the BBC: ""Although the chance of a disaster to planet Earth in a given year may be quite low, it adds up over time, and becomes a near certainty in the next thousand or 10,000 years. He was confident that humans would spread out into the cosmos by that time (given the chance), but added: ""We will not establish self-sustaining colonies in space for at least the next hundred years, so we have to be very careful in this period."" Here, Hawking's views dovetailed with those of entrepreneur Elon Musk, another science superstar whose cogitations attract widespread attention. In 2013, Musk told a conference: ""Either we spread Earth to other planets, or we risk going extinct. An extinction event is inevitable and we're increasingly doing ourselves in."" In line with his thoughts on the matter, Hawking also attached his name to a project researching technologies for interstellar travel - the Breakthrough Starshot initiative.  Hawking recognised the great opportunities that arose from advances in artificial intelligence, but also warned about the dangers.  In 2014, he told the BBC that ""the development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race"". Hawking said the primitive forms of artificial intelligence developed so far had already proved very useful; indeed, the tech he used to communicate incorporated a basic form of AI. But Hawking feared the consequences of advanced forms of machine intelligence that could match or surpass humans. Some academics thought the comments drew on outdated science fiction tropes. Others, such as Prof Bradley Love, from UCL, agreed there were risks: ""Clever AI will create tremendous wealth for society, but will leave many people without jobs,"" he told The Conversation. But he added: ""If we are going to worry about the future of humanity we should focus on the real challenges, such as climate change and weapons of mass destruction rather than fanciful killer AI robots.""  The Cambridge physicist regarded global warming as one of the biggest threats to life on the planet. Hawking was particularly fearful of a so-called tipping point, where global warming would become irreversible. He also expressed concern about America's decision to pull out of the Paris Agreement. ""We are close to the tipping point where global warming becomes irreversible. Trump's action could push the Earth over the brink, to become like Venus, with a temperature of 250 degrees, and raining sulphuric acid,"" he told BBC News. The UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) also highlights the potential risk of hitting climate tipping points as temperatures increase - though it also emphasises the gaps in our knowledge. However, Hawking was in plentiful company in regarding global warming as one of the great challenges of centuries to come. There's a whole field of science, known as Seti (The Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence) dedicated to listening for signals from intelligent beings elsewhere in the Universe. But Hawking cautioned against trying to actively hail any alien civilisations that might be out there. In 2010, he told the Discovery Channel that aliens might simply raid Earth for resources and then move on. ""If aliens visit us, the outcome would be much as when Columbus landed in America, which didn't turn out well for the Native Americans,"" he said. ""We only have to look at ourselves to see how intelligent life might develop into something we wouldn't want to meet."" At the time, Seth Shostak, from the Seti Institute in California, told the Guardian: ""This is an unwarranted fear. If they're interested in resources, they have ways of finding rocky planets that don't depend on whether we broadcast or not. They could have found us a billion years ago."" But others saw the logic in Hawking's comments. Ian Stewart, a mathematician at Warwick University, commented: ""Lots of people think that because they would be so wise and knowledgeable, they would be peaceful. I don't think you can assume that."" The media attention gave him an unprecedented platform. But some in the scientific community were occasionally less enthusiastic about the resulting headlines than the journalists who wrote them.  Indeed, I've been asked in the past why the British media seemed to hang on Hawking's every word. Prof Sir Martin Rees, the Astronomer Royal, said: ""He had robust common sense, and was ready to express forceful political opinions.  ""However, a downside of his iconic status was that that his comments attracted exaggerated attention even on topics where he had no special expertise - for instance philosophy, or the dangers from aliens or from intelligent machines."" But many would also argue that, beyond individual statements or headlines, Hawking had a unique ability to connect with the public.  They would say that the ""hype"" this sometimes generated was an inevitable by-product of his household name status. Instead, we should focus on a greater good - his ability to bring science to the attention of people who might otherwise never have given it a second thought. It's testament to his success as a communicator that the mourning for this champion of rational thinking extends far beyond the scientific community. Follow Paul on Twitter."
Hawkish,Rail worker jumped to avoid being hit by train,2024-09-25,2023-05-25,By Charlotte Cox,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-65707650,"A rail track worker jumped from the path of a train travelling at 55mph with just two seconds to spare. A Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) report said prompt use of the horn by the train driver had ""probably avoided a fatal accident"".  The track worker, who jumped into an adjacent line, was uninjured. Both the driver and worker were left ""shaken"" by the near miss near Teignmouth, Devon, the RAIB said.  In a safety report, it concluded ""informal communication"" between the worker and their engineering supervisor had led to ""assumptions"". The ""narrow miss"" near Teignmouth Station in the early hours of 14 February 2023 took place as the worker placed a sign with flashing lights on the track to indicate a work site.  The work was part of a project to build a rockfall shelter during which workers accessed the Great Western Main Line at Teignmouth Boatyard. After rounding a curve at about 55mph (88km/h), the driver spotted the worker and ""immediately sounded the train's warning horn"". The track worker ""jumped into the adjacent line which was also still open to traffic"". ""Less than two seconds later, the marker board was struck by the passing train"", the RAIB said.  The report said the incident occurred despite ""several conversations"" between the worker and his supervisor. But during tasks away from the operational railway, the worker was joined by their supervisor, leading to the assumption it was safe to start track work.  When the worker was later instructed to place the marker boards, the status of the track was not discussed, the RAIB said.  The worker headed to the Dawlish Warren end of the work site and, despite two subsequent phone calls with their supervisor, there was no further discussion on the status of the track. The report indicated the supervisor expected another call from the worker to confirm they could safely access the track, but the worker was ""mistakenly under the impression"" the track had been blocked to trains and did not call again. The report concluded ""informal communication"" between the track worker and supervisor arose due to ""their familiarity with each other, their good working relationship and because they had been applying the same work site arrangements almost every night for several months"".  The report referenced a similar incident in May 2019 in Bedfordshire. A Network Rail spokeswoman said: ""This was a serious incident where a railway worker could have been badly injured, or worse.  ""As a safety critical company, we work hard to prevent this type of incident from happening, but we recognise there is always room for improvement, and lessons will be learnt from this. ""We have already shared the outputs of an internal review, and will also be sharing the findings of the RAIB report with colleagues."" Follow BBC News South West on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

Hawkish,New £7.75m 'city-changing' museum opens,2024-09-25,2018-06-08,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-44300512,"A new £7.75m museum, due to open following a two-year restoration of an historic but underused building, has been described as a ""city-changing"" project. St Albans Museum and Gallery opens to the public later in the city's Grade II* listed Georgian town hall. Set over three floors, it tells the story of the city from the pre-Roman era through to modern times. The council said it had ""breathed new life into the building"". The town hall, built in 1831, which still houses the city's former courtroom and prison cells, has been largely redundant in recent years and was costing the authority about £100,000 a year to maintain. Meanwhile the old Museum of St Albans was attracting limited visitors due to its location on the edge of the town centre. In the restored building, displays tell the story of the district's development from 110,000 BC and feature Roman treasures and evidence of Boudicca's revolt. Visitors will also learn more about St Albans' role in War of the Roses and the city's famous figures such as Sir Francis Bacon, Ryder Cup founder and ex-mayor, Samuel Ryder, Prof Stephen Hawking, Stanley Kubrick and Jim Rodford. There is also space for exhibitions and contemporary art shows. The project received £2.8m from the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) and St Albans Council will provide £3.3m from the redevelopment of the former site for housing. The St Albans Museums and Galleries Trust raised £1.5m and is looking to raise a further £200,000. Councillor Annie Brewster said: ""This is a city-changing project. So many people, in fact over four million a year, walked past our Grade II* listed town hall and court house rarely giving a second thought to its grand past. ""We have created a new chapter, after over half a century of somewhat dormant purposes, we have breathed new life into the building and transformed it for new generations to enjoy."""
Hawkish,Oscars condemns Will Smith slap and launches review,2024-09-25,2022-03-28,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-60908869,"The Oscars film academy has condemned Will Smith for slapping Chris Rock at Sunday's ceremony, and has launched a formal review of the incident. A statement said it would ""explore further action and consequences"" in accordance with California law, and the body's standards of conduct.  Smith slapped Rock in the face on stage after the comic made a joke about the actor's wife, Jada Pinkett Smith. Moments later Smith won his first ever Oscar - for best actor in King Richard. Rock took aim at Pinkett Smith's shaved head, a result of the hair-loss condition alopecia. The incident cast a pall on what should have been Hollywood's biggest celebration and overshadowed others' achievements, one member of the Academy of Motion Pictures, Arts and Sciences - which organises the Oscars ceremony - told the BBC. ""I woke up so bummed out about what Will Smith did,"" said the member. ""To me, he stole the limelight. I don't think that was the place to be so violent. Most people were shocked. There were children there. It was a place to celebrate."" She asked not to be named. Monday's statement from the organisation behind the Oscars said: ""The Academy condemns the actions of Mr Smith at last night's show. We have officially started a formal review around the incident and will explore further action and consequences in accordance with our Bylaws, Standards of Conduct and California law."" Shortly after Sunday night's incident, Smith was seen apparently being comforted by actors Denzel Washington and Tyler Perry. Actor and comedian Tiffany Haddish, who co-starred with Jada Pinkett Smith in the 2017 comedy Girls Trip, described the exchange to People magazine as ""the most beautiful thing I've ever seen"". She said Smith had stood up for his wife. However, many said Smith was wrong to use violence.  Marshall Herskovitz, a film producer, tweeted early on Monday morning: ""I call upon the Academy, of which I am a member, to take disciplinary action against Will Smith. He disgraced our entire community tonight."" Roger Ross Williams, a black member of the Academy's board of governors, told the Hollywood Reporter that the confrontation drove him to tears because ""it reinforces stereotypes about black people and it just hurts me to my core"". Actor Wendell Pierce, whose credits include HBO's The Wire and Treme, said he was hoping for ""a public act of contrition"" from Smith.  But he pointed out that Rock once produced a documentary on how black hairstyles are tied to identity. ""That film showed an appreciation for Jada's, and Black women's, struggle with the disease of alopecia. The joke did not. It insulted and provoked,"" he wrote on Twitter. On social media, some users suggested Smith's actions could have violated the Academy's code of conduct and wondered whether Smith would be asked to return his award for Best Actor, which he collected onstage shortly after slapping Rock. The code states the Academy is ""categorically opposed to any form of abuse, harassment or discrimination"", including members acting ""in a manner that violates standards of decency"". It also reserves the right for the Academy board to suspend or expel those in violation of the code. However, Hollywood insiders like actor Whoopi Goldberg have said it is unlikely Smith will lose his award. ""We're not going to take that Oscar from him,"" she predicted. ""There will be consequences I'm sure, but I don't think that's what they're going to do."" Smith earned the award - his first - for his portrayal of Richard Williams, the father of tennis legends Venus and Serena Williams, in the film King Richard.  In a tearful acceptance speech, he apologised to his fellow nominees - but not to Rock - and said ""love will make you do crazy things"".  His wife has previously described hair loss due to her autoimmune disease as ""terrifying"". She looked unamused when Rock quipped to her: ""Jada, can't wait for GI Jane 2,"" in an apparent reference to her shaved head and a 1997 film in which the titular character sports a buzz cut. Moments later, Smith walked on stage and struck Rock before returning to his seat and shouting: ""Keep my wife's name out of your [expletive] mouth."" Comic Kathy Griffin said the slap sets a dangerous precedent. ""Now we all have to worry about who wants to be the next Will Smith in comedy clubs and theatres,"" she wrote. Rock declined to press charges and has not commented publicly about the slap. In the moments after the altercation, he quipped that it was probably ""the greatest night in the history of television"", before presenting the award for best documentary.

Hawkish,Postcard from 1907 reveals address of suffragette,2024-09-25,2023-03-01,By Dan Martin,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-leicestershire-64803813,"A suffragette is to be commemorated on International Women's Day with a blue plaque on the house where she lived. The plaque will be placed on the former home of Alice Hawkins in Mantle Road, Leicester, on 8 March. Many suffragettes, including Ms Hawkins, refused to provide their addresses to census officials, but a postcard owned by her descendants gave the address. Her great-grandson Peter Barratt said it was a touching gesture. Mr Barratt worked with city councillors and Ismail Dale of Heritage Schools to get the plaque. Pupils from nearby primary and secondary schools will lead its unveiling.  The Hawkins family lived at the property in the early 1900s when Ms Hawkins was campaigning to secure the vote for women. The postcard was sent to her by Leeds suffragette Mary Gawthorpe on 11 June 1907 and provided valuable information on where Ms Hawkins lived. It allowed Mr Barratt and the councillors to confirm the address, with the records office identifying a location for the plaque. Mr Barratt said: ""To see a plaque unveiled on the very house where Alice and family, including our grandfather, lived over 100 years ago will be a very touching moment for myself and all her descendants who will be with me on the day."" The plaque not only commemorates Ms Hawkins, but many of the other local women who campaigned alongside her for equality at the ballot box. Ms Hawkins worked as a machinist at the Equity Shoe factory in Leicester and realised working conditions and pay for women were inferior compared to those of her male colleagues. She began campaigning for equality and joined the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU). After attending her first meeting in February 1907, she joined a march to the House of Commons and was jailed for the first of five times. She was one of several women charged down by mounted police and sent to Holloway prison. The suffragette campaign finally prompted the government to pass the 1918 Representation of the People Act, giving the vote to the first women - although not all women - in Britain. Ms Hawkins died in 1946, aged 83, and was buried in a pauper's grave. Fosse ward councillor Sue Waddington, who has been involved in the campaign, said: ""I am very pleased that the plaque to celebrate Alice's life will be a permanent reminder of her life in Fosse ward and her struggles for votes for women.""

Hawkish,Bolton says US wants to see Brexit happen,2024-09-25,2019-05-31,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-48481309,"The Trump administration wants the UK to follow the 2016 referendum result and leave the European Union, National Security Advisor John Bolton said. Speaking to the UK's Telegraph, Mr Bolton said Brexit was an opportunity for the UK to become a ""strong and independent country"". His remarks came ahead of a UK visit by President Trump, who has previously stated his support for Brexit. Mr Trump was critical of Prime Minister Theresa May's negotiations with the EU. The president's three-day trip, from 3 to 5 June, includes a Buckingham Palace dinner and breakfast with Mrs May, who has hailed the visit as an opportunity for the UK and US ""to strengthen our already close relationship"". Speaking ahead of his visit, President Trump praised the UK Conservative Party leadership contender Boris Johnson, saying he would make ""excellent"" choice. In an interview published on Friday, Mr Bolton - a former ambassador to the UN who is considered one of the more hawkish members of the Trump administration - said the world and the Nato military alliance would benefit from the UK being outside the EU. ""As a separate nation again, Britain's impact on the world has the prospect of being even greater... I think it will help us in Nato in particular to have another strong and independent country that will help Nato to be more effective, and that has to be a plus."" He added: ""The US preference is for Britain to follow the course of what the people asked for and leave the EU. It's a lesson for everyone in the triumph of democracy."" Mr Bolton said the first step towards a closer relationship was for the next prime minister to finish the Brexit process and negotiate a new trade deal with the US. Last week, Mrs May - whose withdrawal agreement with the EU was rejected by the UK Parliament three times - announced that she would quit as Conservative party leader on 7 June but stay in office until a successor was found. ""[Mr Trump] wants to make a deal with Britain that will leave both of us better off, and free Britain from the regulatory constraints it faces with the EU,"" Mr Bolton said. The US president, who has previously said Mrs May had not listened to his advice on how to negotiate a deal with the EU, said the agreement reached by the prime minister sounded ""like a great deal for the EU"". He had also raised fears that, under Mrs May's Brexit deal, the US and the UK would not be able to negotiate a free trade agreement. Mr Trump has said he might meet Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage and Conservative MP Boris Johnson - one of the 11 contenders to replace Mrs May as Conservative leader - during his trip to the UK.  Meanwhile, there are growing signs that President Trump will warn British authorities that the US government is prepared to limit intelligence sharing if the UK allows Chinese technology giant Huawei to build part of its 5G network Washington believes the technology could be used by China to spy, a claim Huawei has denied.   Speaking in Germany, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said: ""The risk that we'll have to change our behaviour in light of the fact that we can't permit private citizen data from the US or national security data from the US to go across networks that we don't have confidence, that we don't view as trusted networks."" The UK, where 5G was launched in six cities on Thursday, is moving towards letting Huawei build certain parts of its network - non-core elements, such as transmission equipment rather than information infrastructure.

Hawkish,Russia replaces commander of Ukraine invasion force,2024-09-25,2023-01-11,By Will Vernon in Moscow and Laura Gozzi in London,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-64235713,"President Vladimir Putin has removed Russia's top commander in Ukraine, just three months after he was installed.  Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov will now lead what Mr Putin terms a ""special military operation"".  Gen Gerasimov replaces Sergei Surovikin who has overseen recent brutal attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure. The reshuffle comes as Russians claim they are making progress in eastern Ukraine after suffering a series of military defeats in recent months.  Russia launched its invasion into Ukraine on 24 February.  Gen Gerasimov, who has been in post since 2012, is the longest-serving Russian chief of general staff of the post-Soviet era. Gen Surovikin - now his deputy - has been dubbed ""General Armageddon"" for his brutal tactics in previous wars, including Russia's operations in Syria and the heavy bombardment of the city of Aleppo in particular. Shortly after he was appointed to lead the operation in October, Russia began its campaign to destroy Ukraine's energy infrastructure, leaving millions of Ukrainian civilians without power or running water for extended periods in the depths of winter. He also oversaw Russia's withdrawal from the southern city of Kherson - a major success for the Ukrainians.  Russia's defence ministry said the decision to replace Gen Surovikin was aimed at organising ""closer contact between different branches of the armed forces and improving the quality and effectiveness of the management of Russian forces"". But the move has been seen by some as a sign that he may have gained too much power.  ""As the unified commander in Ukraine, Surovikin was becoming very powerful, and was likely bypassing [Russian Defence Minister Sergei] Shoigu and Gerasimov when talking to Putin,"" military analyst Rob Lee wrote on Twitter. Some of Russia's hawkish military bloggers, who support the war but frequently criticise the way it is being carried out, have been highly critical of Russia's military leadership, including the new head of the special operation, Gen Gerasimov. Wednesday's announcement comes as fighting continues in Soledar. The fall of Soledar may help Russian troops in their assault on the strategic city of Bakhmut, about 10km (six miles) to the south-west, providing them with a secure artillery position within range of the city.   Soledar also has deep salt mines, which could be used to station troops and store equipment, protected from Ukrainian missiles. Russia's mercenary Wagner Group has taken full credit for ""storming"" it.  On Tuesday night, the group's leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, said his forces were in full control of Soledar. However, on Wednesday the Russian defence ministry released a statement appearing to contradict his claim - or that only Wagner group troops were involved.  This led to Mr Prigozhin repeating the claim on Wednesday evening. In a short statement on Telegram, he boasted that his mercenaries had killed around 500 pro-Ukraine troops. ""The whole city is littered with the corpses of Ukrainian soldiers,"" he wrote.  Ukraine has recently made similar comments about piles of Russian bodies.  There is no independent confirmation. The US-based Maxar Technologies company has published pictures of Soledar from August and early January, showing the scale of destruction during the recent fighting. The apparent differences in Russia's official narrative surrounding the latest events around Soledar hint at divisions in the country's military leadership, particularly between the Wagner Group and the defence ministry.  For his part, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky denied that Soledar had fallen.  ""The terrorist state and its propagandists are trying to pretend"" to have achieved some successes in Soledar, Mr Zelensky said in his nightly address on Wednesday, ""but the fighting continues"". ""We do everything, without stopping for a single day, to strengthen Ukrainian defence. Our potential is growing,"" he added."
Hawkish,Heatwave leaves dozens of gulls with burns,2024-09-25,2018-07-27,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-somerset-44984275,"Dozens of young gulls have had to be treated for burnt feet because of the heatwave, a wildlife centre said. More than 270 birds have been taken to Somerset's Secret World Wildlife Rescue with ""severe"" burns on their feet. The charity said it had been inundated with juvenile gulls - nesting on industrial buildings - that fell off after the roofs became ""scalding hot"". A spokeswoman for the centre said the young birds had been placed in buckets of water to ""cool their feet down"". ""Gulls have been arriving at the centre almost by the hour over the last fortnight,"" the spokeswoman said. More than twice the number of gulls has been admitted to the centre this year compared to last, the charity said. The wildlife centre said the birds were really ""struggling with the weather conditions"". ""Hot surfaces and a lack of shade are causing many of the birds to be brought in with severe sunburn on their feet,"" a spokeswoman said. She said the centre did not want to release the birds while the temperatures remained high."
Hawkish,Why's everyone talking about this outfit?,2024-09-25,2018-03-05,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-43282430,"As always fashion and the Oscars go hand in hand... Here are the outfits trending on social media.  Olympic medallist and figure skater Adam Rippon was one of the first people to arrive on the red carpet in an unconventional outfit. Along with a suit, he was wearing a leather harness designed by the creative director of Moschino, Jeremy Scott. Rippon posted a selfie on Instagram to show off his look - which also included a leather bow tie - prior to arriving on the red carpet. ""Just something casual,"" he wrote as a caption to the picture. It got the thumbs-up from supermodel and fashion icon Tyra Banks, who called the Olympic skater ""fierce"". Rippon, who is the first openly gay US winter Olympian, lit up Twitter with comments about his red carpet look: The bromance between James Ivory, director and screenwriter of Call Me by Your Name and star of the film, Timothee Chalamet continued at tonight's Oscars. Ivory, 89, who is nominated for best adapted screenplay, wore a shirt with lead actor nominee Chalamet's face on it. One of the biggest red carpet moments was 86-year-old Rita Moreno arriving in the same dress she wore when she won her Oscar in 1962 for West Side Story. The 56-year-old dress was made in Manila in the Philippines and included a new neckline but the same black opera gloves.  Tiffany Haddish wore an embroidered cape, headdress and dress called a ""zuria"". The comedian and actress, who is presenting an award tonight, explained what was behind her traditional outfit. ""My father is from Eritrea, and he passed away last year, and he said that if ever I make it here I have to honour my people. So here I am!"" Haddish caused a stir again as a presenter on stage with Maya Rudolph. She changed outfits, wearing an Alexander McQueen dress she wore at the Girls Trip premiere in July and when she hosted Saturday Night Live in November. She joked on the show that she was an ""outfit repeater"" and said the dress would be making another appearance and the comedian kept her word.  Call Me by Your Name stars Timothee Chalamet and Armie Hammer caused a storm when they appeared on the red carpet together. Hammer was too ill to attend Saturday's Independent Spirit Awards and appeared on Chalamet's phone on FaceTime at the ceremony. Fans were extremely pleased to see the pair reunited on the Oscars red carpet.  Unlike the Golden Globes and Baftas, the Oscars were awash with bright colours, with stars making a nod towards the Time's Up movement with pin badges. Tonight's fashion showcased glamorous designs, with pastels and embellishment on the top of the hot list. Elisabeth Moss, Gina Rodriguez, Salma Hayek, Sally Hawkins and Mira Sorvino all reflected this trend, which got the seal of approval on social media.  The Washington Post's Robin Givhan wrote of the colourful fashion choices, ""the solidarity seemed to be more in actions and attitude, with moments such as actress Nicole Kidman dipping into an interview with Sandra Bullock on ABC for a hug and a declaration of affection"". Lady Bird star and leading actress nominee Saoirse Ronan and her sugary-pink Calvin Klein gown was a big hit with fashion writers. Vogue's style editor Edward Barsamian praised the dress for its ""cheerful, optimistic tone"". ""The bow-trimmed gown is poised to sit alongside other memorable Oscar red carpet moments, including Nicole Kidman's mandarin-inspired Galliano for Dior Couture dress in 1997 and Julia Roberts' black and white Valentino stunner from 2001,"" he wrote.  Black Panther's Chadwick Boseman gave a nod to Wakandan fashion in his custom-made Givenchy suit. Despite the film being released too late to receive any nominations at this year's Oscars, it was still the talk of the ceremony. Fellow cast members Lupita Nyong'o and Danai Gurira also created a fashion moment on the red carpet. Marvel's Black Panther also got an honourable mention during the ceremony, with Jimmy Kimmel praising it for its commercial success and ground-breaking content.

Hundreds of people gathered in the city for the private service at the university church, Great St Mary's.

Hawkish,SOS church bells to warn of flood,2024-09-25,2019-02-24,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-47350638,"Villagers in Devon are set to benefit from having the UK's first church bell flood warning system. The 18th Century bells at St Paul's Church in Starcross could now ring out an SOS peal in the event of a flood. They will only be used if the Environment Agency's electronic warning and other forms of communication have failed. Starcross has a long history of tidal flooding, dating back hundreds of years, according to the agency. It gave a grant of £10,000 to have the bells restored, with funds to carry out the work topped up by the community. Churchwarden Tim Miles said: ""We are very excited to welcome the bells back to the church and will sleep soundly knowing they are ready if needed to warn villagers of flooding."" Church bells have a long tradition of being used to warn of hazards and were set to be used in the event of a German invasion during World War Two. Jane Fletcher-Peters, flood resilience officer at the agency, said: ""Starcross is very much a boating community so it made sense that if the church bells were sounded to warn of flood, ringers would adopt an SOS peal familiar to residents."" The agency also started work in January 2018 on a £4 million tidal defence scheme to better protect 660 homes and businesses at Starcross and nearby Cockwood from coastal flooding."
Hawkish,Ron DeSantis says his Ukraine remarks ‘mischaracterised’,2024-09-25,2023-03-23,By Max Matza,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-65047556,"Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has reportedly sought to clear up his description of the Russia-Ukraine war as a ""territorial dispute"", in the wake of a backlash from fellow Republicans. The widely tipped 2024 White House contender said in a TV interview his remarks had been ""mischaracterised"". He also struck a tougher tone on Vladimir Putin, calling the Russian president a ""war criminal"". Recent opinion polls suggest Mr Trump has been gaining over Mr DeSantis. The former president has been launching a sustained attack in recent weeks against his onetime political protege. Mr DeSantis has kept tight-lipped on his rumoured plans to challenge Mr Trump for the Republican White House nomination. Speaking to Piers Morgan Uncensored, the Florida governor was asked about his description earlier this month of the Russia-Ukraine war as a ""territorial dispute"".  ""Well, I think it's been mischaracterised,"" he said, according to a preview of the interview, which airs on Thursday.  The Florida governor - who won a landslide re-election last year - said his comment had referred only to the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine and the occupied Crimean peninsula.  ""There's a lot of ethnic Russians there,"" the 44-year-old continued. ""So, that's some difficult fighting and that's what I was referring to.""  ""It wasn't that I thought Russia had a right to that,"" Mr DeSantis added, calling the notion that Moscow was justified in its attack ""nonsense"". ""If I could snap my fingers, I'd give it back to Ukraine 100%,"" the former congressman and ex-US Navy lawyer continued. His ""territorial dispute"" remark prompted Ukraine to issue the governor an invitation to visit the war-torn country. While the comment seemed to align the Florida governor with Mr Trump, who has opposed US support for Kyiv, it provoked criticism from hawkish Republican senators Marco Rubio and Lindsey Graham, drawing battle lines between the isolationist and establishment wings of the party. On Wednesday, Mr Trump said on his Truth Social platform that Mr DeSantis had ""crashed"" in the polls, dismissing him as an ""average governor"". A Monmouth University opinion poll released on Tuesday indicated Mr Trump had a double-digit lead in the Republican primary contest, reversing Mr DeSantis' recent gains."

Those wishing to honour the theoretical physicist, who died in March aged 76, can apply via a public ballot. Applicants need to give their birth date - which can be any day up to 31 December 2038. Prof Hawking's foundation said the possibility of time travel had not been disproven and could not be excluded. It was London travel blogger IanVisits who noticed that those born from 2019 to 2038 were theoretically permitted to attend the service at Westminster Abbey. He said: ""Professor Hawking once threw a party for time travellers, to see if any would turn up if he posted the invite after the party.  ""None did, but it seems perfect that the memorial website allows people born in the future to attend the service.  ""Look out for time travellers at the Abbey."" After the ""time traveller party"", held in June 2009, Prof Hawking remarked that the fact that no-one turned up was ""experimental evidence that time travel is not possible"". Within 24 hours of the opening of the ballot for the thanksgiving service, to be held on 15 June, about 12,000 people from more than 50 countries had applied for tickets. While all applicants appear to be from the present day, a spokesman for the Stephen Hawking Foundation said: ""We cannot exclude the possibility of time travel as it has not been disproven to our satisfaction. ""All things are possible until proven otherwise. ""But so far we have had applications from all round the world, and we do mean round - there are no flat-Earthers here."" People from as far away as the US, China, Bolivia and the South Pacific have asked to attend the event to celebrate the life of Prof Hawking, who died on 14 March, more than 50 years after he was diagnosed with a rare form of motor neurone disease. Thousands lined the streets of his home city of Cambridge for his funeral on 31 March. The ballot for tickets to his memorial service closes at midnight on 15 May."

Speaking at the nominees luncheon in Los Angeles, Janet Yang said in future the Academy ""must act swiftly, compassionately and decisively"". Smith hit Rock on stage at last year's Academy Awards show after Rock made a joke about Smith's wife. Minutes later, he tearfully accepted an award for Best Actor in King Richard. The Academy was criticised for allowing the show to continue with Will Smith's participation in the wake of the assault. ""What happened on stage was fully unacceptable and the response from our organisation was inadequate,"" Ms Yang said on Monday. ""We learned from this that the Academy must be fully transparent and accountable in our actions, and particularly in times of crisis we must act swiftly and compassionately and decisively for ourselves and for our industry."" She was speaking in Beverly Hills to the room of nominees including Brendan Fraser, Angela Bassett, Tom Cruise and Michelle Yeoh. Following the slap, the Academy launched a review into how the fallout was handled, which resulted in Smith being banned from Academy events for 10 years.  Smith has apologised several times, called his actions ""shocking, painful and inexcusable"", and resigned from the Academy. The slap divided opinions, with some praising Smith for standing up for his wife, while others condemned the violence. On the night, Smith was supported by Tyler Perry and Denzel Washington, and actress Tiffany Haddish called the slap ""the most beautiful thing I've ever seen"". However film producer Marshall Herskovitz called on the Academy to ""take disciplinary action against Will Smith"" because ""he disgraced our entire community tonight."" Actress Mia Farrow said that it was the ""Oscars' ugliest moment"".  Chris Rock did not press charges and publicly spoke out about the slap a few months later, stating that he is ""not a victim""."
Hawkish,Square to be renamed after black footballer,2024-09-25,2020-06-18,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-53095468,"A public square in Plymouth will be renamed after one of the first black football players, the city council has said. It comes after the council agreed to change the name from the 16th Century slave trader Sir John Hawkins. Instead it will commemorate Plymouth Argyle player Jack Leslie, who was the only professional black player in England between 1921 and 1934. Plymouth City Council said it was ""not seeking to rewrite history"". Leslie's name was put forward to the council following anti-racism protests across the country. Council leader Tudor Evans said Leslie deserved to be ""remembered and commemorated in the city that he represented for most of his professional career"". He added: ""We are not seeking to rewrite history and we are not saying that we should forget Hawkins. He was without question an important figure in our national history.  ""We can remember and acknowledge this in a way that tells a fuller story about his life and doesn't commemorate him in way that gives offence."" Jack Leslie scored more than 137 goals for Plymouth Argyle in 401 appearances, and remains the Pilgrims' fourth highest goal-scorer of all time, the city council said. He was set to become the first black player to represent England but was denied the opportunity when selectors were told he was a black man. Councillor Chris Penberthy, cabinet member for Housing and Co-operative Development, said naming the square after him would be ""a wonderful way"" of recognising his role in national football. ""As a city we want to remember him and are very pleased that his family has agreed for the square to be named Jack Leslie Square."" A petition to rename the square after Leslie was signed by more than 500 people. Appeals against the name change will be considered while a Public Health Act Street Renaming Notice is displayed for a month."
Hawkish,A Nato summit for hawks,2024-09-25,2022-06-30,By Frank Gardner,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-62001165,"Historic, transformative, game-changing. Even before this year's Nato summit began, the epithets were rolling in. For this was the first such summit since Russia's fateful invasion of Ukraine on 24 February. Would differences bubble up to the surface? Would some countries push for an early ceasefire in Ukraine? Or would the alliance's more hawkish leaders get their way and see a new, robust posture towards Moscow with Nato's borders reinforced? Most important of all, would Turkey drop its opposition to two key democracies - Finland and Sweden - joining the alliance? That diplomatic breakthrough came early on with the two Nordic nations set to be fast-tracked to membership after their foreign ministers signed a security pact with Turkey. The Kremlin reacted with predictable indignation, branding Nato an aggressive, expansionist organisation with imperialistic ambitions. I asked Jens Stoltenberg, Nato's Secretary General, for his reaction. ""Finland and Sweden,"" he replied, ""are two sovereign democratic nations and they have the right to choose their own path. ""Russia doesn't respect the decisions of free nations and therefore it uses force to try to prevent them from doing what they want. That's one of the reasons why they have invaded Ukraine."" And what, I asked Stoltenberg, would he say to those who suggest that Nato is partly to blame for the war in Ukraine by ""provoking"" a paranoid Kremlin which claims it is being surrounded by a hostile Nato? ""This idea that Nato has some kind of responsibility for the [Ukraine] war is absolutely meaningless,"" retorted the Nato chief. ""Ukraine is a sovereign nation, they have made their decision. We are 30 allies, we have made our decision. None of that is an excuse to invade another country. ""The core of this matter is that President Putin doesn't like a free democratic successful nation on his borders. He therefore wants to re-establish some kind of sphere of influence. That's unacceptable and that's why our allies are providing unprecedented levels of support to Ukraine."" That support materialised into a billion-pound package of UK military aid, including drones and electronic warfare kit, bringing the UK's military assistance to Kyiv to £2.3bn. By midway through the summit the US had announced a package of reinforcements for Europe: two squadrons of F35 stealth bombers to be sent to Britain, two naval destroyers to Spain and thousands of troops to Romania. The UK followed suit, announcing a further 1,000 troops to be allocated for the defence of Estonia, a frontline state on Russia's border with one of its two aircraft carriers allocated - in a time of emergency - to a newly enlarged Nato rapid response force that's set to grow from 40,000 troops to over 300,000. The aim of all this, Nato ministers told me, was to build such a powerful deterrent that President Putin is dissuaded from launching any more land grabs in Europe. But what about an eventual peace deal? Will it ever be possible to make a deal with Russia that ends the war in Ukraine? That can only happen, said the UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, once Russia is pushed out of Ukraine and held accountable for its (alleged) war crimes. Interviewing her in the shadow of the towering, plate-glass skyscraper that houses the UK's embassy in Madrid, I asked her if she still believed that included making Russia give up Crimea, which it annexed in 2014. She wouldn't be drawn. But she said Nato needed to ensure that a Russian invasion of a sovereign nation could never be repeated.  Ms Truss was far from being the only ""hawk"" pushing for a robust stance towards Russia, and to a lesser degree China. In a sunlit Spanish garden in downtown Madrid I interviewed Estonia's Prime Minister Kaja Kallas. Could she, as a neighbour of Russia, I asked, trust in a future peace deal with Moscow? ""I think the West has been misled by Putin,"" she replied. ""He has lied a lot and has not kept the promises that he has given and therefore we shouldn't believe him any more. Plus the mistake that we have done is that the war crimes have not been punished."" If there were any dissenting voices among leaders at this summit, I didn't hear them. But once those leaders have returned home they may find more domestic problems taking priority. So not every ambition announced with such fanfare in Madrid may end up being fulfilled."

Hawkish,US immigration bill teeters on brink,2024-09-25,2018-06-21,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-44559008,"A Republican effort to pass an immigration law is in disarray amid a political battle over migrant children separated from their parents. A compromise bill drafted by moderate and conservative Republicans lacks any votes from Democratic lawmakers and even some Republicans. A vote on the bill, which would fund a border wall while reducing legal migration, has been delayed to Friday. The House rejected a more hardline conservative measure on Thursday. Republicans joined Democrats to vote by 193-231 to scupper the more hawkish bill. President Donald Trump earlier in the day blamed Democrats for the ongoing impasse. At a White House cabinet meeting, he pledged to sign an immigration reform bill if Congress can pass it. ""The lawmakers have to sit down and they have to do something because our country cannot continue to run like this,"" Mr Trump said. The congressional deadlock comes a day after the Republican president moved to roll back his policy of migrant family separations amid outcry over the ""zero tolerance"" policy.  He issued an executive order calling for the children to be kept with their parents, who are being detained on charges of crossing the border illegally. But the fate of hundreds of children already separated by the policy is unclear.  Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington Comprehensive immigration reform in Congress was dead in February, when the Senate failed to pass any of the measures the chamber was considering.  It was dead earlier this month, after an insurgent effort to force a vote on a bipartisan bill in the House failed. It was dead this week, despite outcry over the border crisis caused by the Trump administration's family separation policy.  It was dead on Thursday, as a hardline bill went down to defeat in the House. Its prospects don't look any better for Friday, when the Republican leadership's ""compromise"" proposal probably will meet the same fate. At some point, this Congress has to chisel the headstone and throw flowers on immigration reform's grave. There simply isn't the will - or the willingness to compromise - required to pass legislation before the end of the year. Donald Trump blames Senate rules that he says give the minority Democrats too much power. Democrats blame the president's fixation on a border wall and sweeping changes to legal immigration programmes. Moderate Republicans blame far-right conservatives, and vice versa. Congress has been struggling with immigration reform for decades. With mid-term elections looming, politicians will take the issue to the campaign trail - but it's a struggle with no end in sight.  The House bill still under consideration is a compromise between conservatives and moderate Republicans.  It includes funding for a border wall, along with a pathway to citizenship for the Dreamers - immigrants who illegally entered the US as children. On Thursday, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan said the measure would also fund resources to keep migrant families together while their cases are processed. The second, more conservative bill that was rejected by the House on Thursday excluded the Dreamers clause. Republicans control both congressional chambers and the White House.  But with no Democratic backing for the legislation, White House officials and the Republican leadership have been trying to drum up support among rank-and-file lawmakers. In a rare outburst on the House floor Conservative Republican congressman Mark Meadows slammed the compromise bill as ""not ready for primetime"". The Freedom Caucus chairman was reportedly furious with Mr Ryan for leaving out two provisions from the bill, but the two Republicans later said their absence had been the result of a misunderstanding. Meanwhile, the Senate is working on a narrower compromise bill focusing on the family separations. Republicans hold a narrower majority in the upper chamber, leading Mr Trump question on Thursday ""what is the purpose"" of the House voting on ""good immigration bills"", if they will be struck down by the Senate."
Hawkish,'Vital' daily rail route to restart after 49 years,2024-09-25,2021-03-19,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-56450227,"Daily rail services are to restart between Okehampton and Exeter for the first time in nearly 50 years. December has been pencilled in for the resumption of regular passenger services on the 14 mile (23km) route. Regular services were withdrawn in 1972, although the route has been used on Sundays in the summer since 1997. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps called re-opening the picturesque route a ""milestone moment in our efforts to restore our railways"". Network Rail is working with Great Western Railway to deliver the service with trains running every two hours, seven days a week.  Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak committed more than £40m in the last Budget to restoring the rail service. Funding for the service, which could become hourly in 2022, is part of the Department for Transport's Restoring your Railway initiative, said the Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS). Mel Stride, Conservative MP for Central Devon, said he was ""delighted"" that the ""vital scheme"" was going ahead. Dr Michael Ireland, from campaigners OkeRail said it was ""really important"" for the ""whole of the region out to Holsworthy and Bude"" and was ""incredible news for tourism, for the economy, and for education and leisure"". The move has given increased vigour to backers of a route connecting Okehampton with Tavistock and Plymouth. Devon County Council has submitted two further bids as part of the Restoring Your Railway Fund to the section between Bere Alston and Tavistock, and the section between Tavistock and Okehampton.

Hawkish,MTV VMAs 2018: The 6 must-see moments,2024-09-25,2018-08-21,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-45256712,"Ariana brought her Nonna on stage, Cardi had a message for the doubters, Logic united immigrant families and Millie Bobby Brown was the life and soul of the party. The MTV VMAs were as star-studded as ever, and with so many talents and egos in the room, there were some attention-grabbing moments. Thanks to the Ariana Grande song, we all know by now that God Is A Woman. And her performance of that song gave us one of the performances of the night. It started with Ariana and a cast of female dancers - including a black female bikini-wearing Jesus - sitting at a long table, evoking The Last Supper, Leonardo Da Vinci's painting of Jesus and his disciples. And it finished with Ariana's beloved Nonna, her mother Joan and cousin Lani joining her on stage, hand-in-hand in a show of female unity. That wasn't the only moment where Ariana got people talking. When Nicki Minaj walked up the steps to collect the award for best hip-hop, it was Ariana who stepped out from her front-row seat to save the rapper from tripping on her (see-through) dress. Eagle-eyed fans spotted something else. Beforehand, on the pink carpet, Grande was loved-up with fiance Pete Davidson, who was wearing a home-made bead bracelet bearing the initials AGD - Ariana Grande Davidson. Aww. In her intro to the show, co-host Tiffany Haddish managed to mangle Camila Cabello's name (""Y'all know I can't read that good - I only speak English"") before going on to diss Camila's former Fifth Harmony sisters. ""She's nominated for five VMAs tonight,"" the actress and comedian said. ""I'm super proud of her. So those of you watching at home... Hi Fifth Harmony!"" Cut to Camila furiously shaking her head to make sure the world knew she didn't approve. But Nicki Minaj was there for the girl group. After safely navigating the steps to collect her hip-hop award - and after she gave us a view through her dress - she ticked off Tiffany: ""Don't be coming for Fifth Harmony."" Cardi B had been expected to give her first performance since giving birth last month, but she didn't perform in the end. Instead, she opened the show - unveiling a newly cropped hairstyle - and pretended to breastfeed on stage, holding a bundle of blankets to her chest as she gave a short introduction. Given this ceremony's history of shock, a superstar breastfeeding at an award ceremony would have been truly radical. But Cardi unfurled the blankets to reveal one of the VMA trophies. She later won best new artist and used her acceptance speech to say: ""A couple of months ago a lot of people were saying you're gambling your career, you're about to have a baby, what are you doing? And, you know, I had a baby, I carried a baby, and now I'm still winning awards. ""All the love that my fans, that my friends, that everybody shows me, is genuine, is beautiful, and that's something that God gave me that you can't buy."" Lots of people have taken that last line as a barb at the expense of Nicki Minaj, who recently gave an interview talking about record labels paying for hits. 4. Logic sent a message to Trump The rapper led dozens of immigrant children and teenagers wearing ""We are all human beings"" through the Radio City Music Hall foyer, down the aisles and onto the stage for a performance of his song One Day with Ryan Tedder. A ""US border patrol"" backdrop lifted halfway through to reveal the kids' siblings and parents, and the families were then reunited. It wasn't hard to decipher the symbolism. A press release said Logic's message was ""to protest the Trump Administration's cruel and inhumane family separation policy that tore thousands of children from their parents and continues to keep hundreds apart"". More on the VMAs: Another highlight was Jennifer Lopez's performance of a medley of her greatest hits, including Jenny From The Block, Love Don't Cost A Thing and All I Have. She also brought out the rapper Ja Rule to perform their 2001 hit I'm Real. She was then presented with MTV's annual Vanguard Award, named after Michael Jackson. During her acceptance speech, she turned to her 10-year-old twins, Maximilian David and Emme Maribel, and said they gave her strength to improve. ""The future is even brighter,"" she said. She was also watched on lovingly by boyfriend, baseball star Alex ""A-Rod"" Rodriguez. The person having the most fun wasn't one of the winners. Millie Bobby Brown presented Cardi B with the best new artist trophy. The 14-year-old Stranger Things star also hung out with Bebe Rexha and Ariana Grande... ...as well as double award winner Camila Cabello.

Hawkish,US tech and film 'collaborating' with China - Barr,2024-09-25,2020-07-16,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-53434147,"US Attorney General William Barr has accused Hollywood and US tech firms of ""collaborating"" with the Chinese government to do business there. Companies like Disney routinely agreed to censor films while Google, Yahoo, Microsoft and Apple were ""all too willing"" to work with Beijing, he said. Such actions risked undermining the liberal world order, Mr Barr added.  His intervention is the latest criticism of China by White House and other US officials. Tensions between the US and China have been rising over a host of issues. The US this week removed Hong Kong's preferential trade status, after China brought in a controversial new security law for the territory. President Donald Trump has also criticised China over its handling of the coronavirus pandemic as well as its military build-up in the South China Sea, its treatment of Muslim minorities, and massive trade surpluses. China has rejected all foreign criticism of its actions.  On Friday, in response to the latest allegations, its foreign ministry said US officials had ""lost their minds and gone mad"". Speaking at the Gerald Ford Presidential Museum, he warned that dependence on China for certain goods risked making the US vulnerable and said US firms were giving up secrets and compromising values under Chinese pressure. ""If Disney and other American corporations continue to bow to Beijing, they risk undermining both their own future competitiveness and prosperity, as well as the classical liberal order that has allowed them to thrive,"" he said. The justice department had seen growing numbers of cases where Chinese officials were lobbying US bosses to favour Beijing's policies, he said. He urged US firms to defy Chinese demands, saying: ""If individual companies are afraid to take a stand, there is strength in numbers."" He criticised technology companies, which he said had ""allowed themselves to become pawns of Chinese influence"".  He also alleged - without providing evidence - that the Chinese government was able to access Apple phones while the company had denied similar access to the US government, and that this was emblematic of a ""double standard that has been emerging among American tech companies"". ""Do you think when Apple sells phones in China, that Apple phones in China are impervious to penetration by Chinese authorities? They wouldn't be sold if they were impervious to Chinese authorities,"" he said.  Apple says it does not have a back door into its phones and will not build one. Mr Barr also praised Facebook, Google, Twitter, and LinkedIn for saying they would not comply with requests for user data under Beijing's new security law in Hong Kong. China's actions showed it did not want to join other industrialised economies but rather wanted to replace them entirely, he said.  Beijing sought to exploit the ""power, productivity and ingenuity"" of China's people to ""overthrow the rule-based international system and to make the world safe for dictatorship"". China was engaged in an ""economic blitzkrieg"" to ""seize the commanding heights of the global economy and to surpass the United States as the world's preeminent superpower"", he added. Zhaoyin Feng, BBC Chinese, Washington DC The Trump administration has long argued that China is taking advantage of America in trade. Mr Barr's remarks ramp up the accusation, alleging that China's ultimate goal in doing business with the US is to replace it and to become a world superpower.  ""Win-win in China means China wins twice,"" he said.  Mr Barr's remarks are among a series of hard-hitting speeches by senior US officials on China, including FBI Director Christopher Wray and National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo expected to follow.  All advocating for a tougher stance against Beijing, some of these speeches were delivered in key swing states like Michigan and Arizona.  Two days ago, President Trump voiced a range of grievances against China during a Rose Garden press conference, which quickly turned into an hour-long monologue attacking his Democratic rival Joe Biden. Campaign rhetoric and voices advocating for more hawkish policies towards China have become indistinguishable, as Mr Trump seems determined to make China a key pillar of his re-election strategy.  On Friday, a spokeswoman for China's foreign ministry said the country had no intention of replacing or challenging the US. Hua Chunying also said officials in Washington criticised China to distract from domestic issues.  ""These people, for self-interest and political gain, do not hesitate to hijack domestic public opinion... to the point where they have lost their minds and gone mad,"" she said. And on Thursday, the foreign ministry accused the White House of unfairly targeting China. ""We know that some in the US are oppressing China and bullying China. As an independent sovereign state, China must respond to the bullying practices and we must say no, we must... take reactive moves to it,"" Ms Hua said. She also responded to media reports that the US could ban Chinese Communist Party members from visiting the US, which she said were ""utterly pathetic"" if true. The Communist Party is the country's sole, ruling political party.  About 7% of the population are members of the party - loyal membership is essential for those who want to climb the career ladder - and members include e-commerce giant Alibaba's Jack Ma, telecomm company Huawei's founder Ren Zhengfei and  actress Fan Bingbing. Mr Barr's speech follows similar warnings about the impact of Chinese activity on the US by other US officials. Earlier this month FBI director Christopher Wray said acts of espionage and theft by China's government pose the ""greatest long-term threat"" to the future of the US. He said China had begun targeting Chinese nationals living abroad, coercing their return, and was working to compromise US coronavirus research. ""China is engaged in a whole-of-state effort to become the world's only superpower by any means necessary,"" Mr Wray added."

Hawkish,Dawlish sea wall promenade to open this summer,2024-09-25,2022-02-04,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-60246052,"A new sea wall built after a railway was destroyed in a storm will open its promenade to the public in the summer. The wall protects the track at Dawlish in Devon from the sea after it was ravaged by huge waves eight years ago. Most of Devon and Cornwall was without a railway line to the rest of the country for several weeks after the storm between 4 and 5 February 2014. Network Rail said the £80m scheme was due to be completed in 2023 and would protect the railway for 100 years. Phil Morton, Network Rail project manager, said: ""This is the last push, which will allow us to open up the beach and then the promenade in the summer."" Construction on the Department for Transport-funded project, which includes the larger sea wall and improvements to Dawlish station, started in May 2019. The first section of new sea wall was completed in July 2020 and construction of the 415m (1,362ft) second section began in November 2020. Network Rail said work on the second section was progressing well, with contractors BAM Nuttall successfully installing all 143 concrete wall panels and curved wave returns on top of the panels. Mr Morton said the project would protect the town and railway for 100 years. ""We took a scale model of the wall into a basin - so a bit like a big swimming pool - and we fired loads of waves at it that we expect to get within 100 years,"" he said. ""It's been tested by a couple of recent storm events and it's performed exactly as we expected."" Network Rail said there was still a lot of work to do, including temporarily diverting the Dawlish river water as part of work on a new stilling basin and on rebuilding the seaward platform and resurfacing the landward platform at Dawlish Station. It said a team of engineers would be working around the clock over four consecutive weekends in February to complete this work. Yan Sayles, BAM Nuttall project manager, said there had been a lot of issues during the build including a materials shortage and the pandemic. He said: ""From that point of view we're ahead of where we thought we would be.  ""It's a challenge all the way through to keep momentum and keep the job going... thankfully the people we've got here really did put themselves out to carry on working.""

Officers from Cornwall and the South West Regional Organised Crime Unit (SWROCU) teamed up with Merseyside Police for Operation Medusa. It involved more than 100 officers and staff from different departments, Devon and Cornwall Police said.  Their work was focused on Newquay and Penzance, with warrants executed in Truro and St Austell. Police said they also stopped a vehicle ""with links to drugs supply"" on the M5 near Exeter. Overall, they said there were 31 arrests for a ""range"" of drug-related offences, theft of a vehicle and possession of weapons. The force said vehicles, drugs, cash and bladed weapons were seized.  Work also involved a week of action in February in areas where drug dealing was believed to have been taking place. Police said 53 people were ""safeguarded"" as a result, with more than £50,000 cash, drugs and other property seized.

Hawkish,Australia's big gamble on the US over China,2024-09-25,2021-09-21,By Frances Mao,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-58635393,"By signing the Aukus pact last week, Australia revealed where it stands in the world: It is taking the side of the US over China. It's a definitive move for a country in the Asia-Pacific region, experts say. The security deal with the US (and the UK) gives Australia a huge defence upgrade from the world's most powerful military. But it's a gift with strings attached. And there is debate over whether such a decision - made without public consultation - will play out in Australia's national interests. As China has grown in power, it has begun to challenge US dominance in the Asia-Pacific region. China has built the world's largest navy and has become increasingly assertive over contested areas such as the South China Sea.  Australia had long maintained it didn't have to choose between the two powers, but in recent years its attitude towards Beijing has hardened.   China has been suspected of interfering in Australian politics and of cyber attacks on key institutions.  Tensions were further inflamed last year when Australia called for an investigation into the origins of the coronavirus. A flurry of Chinese sanctions against Australian exports followed.  That was Australia's ""a-ha"" moment, says John Blaxland, an international security professor at the Australian National University. ""What happened was the dawning realisation that all these things that had preceded weren't benign,"" he says. ""We were talking about a country that had become surprisingly hostile."" Australia realised it needed to improve its defences - and quickly. On that front, Aukus is a big coup for the country. The pact will give Australia access to nuclear-powered submarines and long-range missiles from US technology. This ""super-enables an otherwise pedestrian middle-ranking military capability of little consequence beyond its border"", says Prof Blaxland. In the event of conflict, Australia would also for the first time have the ability to strike adversaries from a distance. ""This is about giving the Australian Defence Force a capable edge in a region where the capability of our own defence force when matched against China is going backwards,"" said Richard Maude, a former top Australian security official and now policy director at Asia Society Australia. For the US, it's a pretty big deal to share the crown jewels of its defence technology. But Washington views this ""one off"" trade as a crucial move in wider efforts to keep China at bay, experts say. As China projects naval power into the region, Australia's fleet - albeit small and some way off being completed - will be some form of counter alongside roving US forces, they add. ""We're trying to play catch-up by developing a credible deterrence to reduce prospects of war,"" says Prof Blaxland.  ""Because at the moment our deterrence is simply not credible. China can essentially act against us with a degree of impunity. That is becoming politically intolerable."" Critics argue Australia has given up its strategic ambiguity and made itself a bigger target because of the pact. ""The way in which it was announced rips away any pretence that Australia was not firmly on the side of containing China militarily,"" says Prof Allan Gyngell, president of the Australian Institute of International Affairs. Analysts warn Australia will probably face more economic retaliations from its biggest trading partner. ""The countries were a long way off returning to diplomatic normality and this only exacerbates that,"" says Dr Lai-Ha Chan from the University of Technology, Sydney. Others say Aukus also locks Australia in with the US for generations to come.  In the future, Australia may struggle to retain autonomy over decisions in its best interests. It will be reliant on foreign nuclear technology. ""We can't operate the submarines ourselves. So in effect we are ceding some of our sovereignty to the US, and maybe Britain,"" Prof Gyngell says. ""It will become therefore impossible for the major strike capacity of the Australian navy to operate without a US veto."" He says it also returns Australia to being ""a smaller partner in the Anglosphere"", despite it making noises in recent times about centring itself in Asia. ""We're hanging out again with the people we're comfortable with, ditching efforts to build closer relations with others in our region,"" Prof Gyngell says. ""That is a problem."" Mr Maude also highlights the risk where South-East Asia will ""increasingly feel that Australia regards security of the region as something that can only be managed by other major Western powers."" It's already caused some backlash within the Asean group of 10 South-East Asian nations. Indonesia has cancelled a meeting with Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison, and Malaysia has warned the pact is a ""catalyst for a nuclear arms race"". Analyst James Chin, from the University of Tasmania, says that Aukus ""reinforces the idea that the opinions of the Asean members matter little when it comes to the superpowers and how they operate in the region."" That said, some analysts say many smaller Asian nations are happy for the US, UK and Australia to make bold moves. ""In private, the pundits will tell you: 'We think you Australians are clod-hopping, ham-fisted and culturally insensitive but we don't dislike what you're actually doing. We just dislike how you're doing it - we'd like you to talk to us before you do it so we feel more included and appreciated,'"" says Prof Blaxland. Most experts say Australia has mishandled its diplomacy around Aukus. It also gravely offended France in reneging on the previous submarine deal. That's a poor sign, experts say, because international relations is as much about diplomacy - as it is about military pacts. It is in Australia's interests - and other democracies - for the US to maintain its dominance in the region, analysts say.  But scholars are fundamentally divided on the best way to achieve that. Some say a more cautious approach is needed; more hawkish voices say China won't respond to anything but a show of force. One thing seems certain - we're headed for a period of greater tension. ""We're used to East Asia being a place of calm in a world. That's no longer going to be true,"" says Prof Gyngell. ""So foreign policy and defence is going to impinge more on the lives of ordinary Australians than it has in past decades. Things are coming closer to home."""
Hawkish,Bolton says US wants to see Brexit happen,2024-09-25,2019-05-31,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-48481309,"The Trump administration wants the UK to follow the 2016 referendum result and leave the European Union, National Security Advisor John Bolton said. Speaking to the UK's Telegraph, Mr Bolton said Brexit was an opportunity for the UK to become a ""strong and independent country"". His remarks came ahead of a UK visit by President Trump, who has previously stated his support for Brexit. Mr Trump was critical of Prime Minister Theresa May's negotiations with the EU. The president's three-day trip, from 3 to 5 June, includes a Buckingham Palace dinner and breakfast with Mrs May, who has hailed the visit as an opportunity for the UK and US ""to strengthen our already close relationship"". Speaking ahead of his visit, President Trump praised the UK Conservative Party leadership contender Boris Johnson, saying he would make ""excellent"" choice. In an interview published on Friday, Mr Bolton - a former ambassador to the UN who is considered one of the more hawkish members of the Trump administration - said the world and the Nato military alliance would benefit from the UK being outside the EU. ""As a separate nation again, Britain's impact on the world has the prospect of being even greater... I think it will help us in Nato in particular to have another strong and independent country that will help Nato to be more effective, and that has to be a plus."" He added: ""The US preference is for Britain to follow the course of what the people asked for and leave the EU. It's a lesson for everyone in the triumph of democracy."" Mr Bolton said the first step towards a closer relationship was for the next prime minister to finish the Brexit process and negotiate a new trade deal with the US. Last week, Mrs May - whose withdrawal agreement with the EU was rejected by the UK Parliament three times - announced that she would quit as Conservative party leader on 7 June but stay in office until a successor was found. ""[Mr Trump] wants to make a deal with Britain that will leave both of us better off, and free Britain from the regulatory constraints it faces with the EU,"" Mr Bolton said. The US president, who has previously said Mrs May had not listened to his advice on how to negotiate a deal with the EU, said the agreement reached by the prime minister sounded ""like a great deal for the EU"". He had also raised fears that, under Mrs May's Brexit deal, the US and the UK would not be able to negotiate a free trade agreement. Mr Trump has said he might meet Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage and Conservative MP Boris Johnson - one of the 11 contenders to replace Mrs May as Conservative leader - during his trip to the UK.  Meanwhile, there are growing signs that President Trump will warn British authorities that the US government is prepared to limit intelligence sharing if the UK allows Chinese technology giant Huawei to build part of its 5G network Washington believes the technology could be used by China to spy, a claim Huawei has denied.   Speaking in Germany, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said: ""The risk that we'll have to change our behaviour in light of the fact that we can't permit private citizen data from the US or national security data from the US to go across networks that we don't have confidence, that we don't view as trusted networks."" The UK, where 5G was launched in six cities on Thursday, is moving towards letting Huawei build certain parts of its network - non-core elements, such as transmission equipment rather than information infrastructure.

Hawkish,Rina Sawayama: I've been blessed by ABBA!,2024-09-25,2022-09-01,By Mark Savage,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-62729302,"Rina Sawayama was at a crucial career point when she started writing her second album last year. Her self-titled debut, a mind-bending cacophony of nu-metal, production line pop and 90s R&B, had become a critical smash during lockdown, and she suddenly found herself in the company of artists she idolised. Elton John asked the singer to re-record her LGBTQ anthem Chosen Family as a duet; Lady Gaga invited her to sing on a remix of her Chromatica track Free Woman; and Charli XCX signed her up for a collaborative single, Beg For You. The Line Of Best Fit named Sawayama the best album of 2020. The New York Times put it second, and the Guardian voted it third. So fans were understandably confused when the record failed to get a nomination for the Mercury Prize. It transpired that it didn't qualify. The singer, who moved from Japan to the UK at the age of five, didn't hold a British passport, so she was ruled ineligible.  Initially, she didn't want to speak up. ""Part of me that worried that I was going to get blacklisted from the music industry,"" she says. But when she did, it caused a huge noise. The hashtag #SawayamaIsBritish started trending and the BPI - which organises both the Mercury and the Brit Awards - agreed to change their criteria. A couple of months later, Sawayama was nominated for her first ever Brit, in the Rising Star category. So when the singer hit the studio in the middle of 2021, she had a lot to prove.  She also had a song, This Hell - a sardonic takedown of homophobia - that she knew could be her comeback.  There was only one problem. The guitar riff sounded a lot like the chorus to ABBA's Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight). Abba are notoriously protective of their copyright, so when Sawayama realised the similarity, she ""freaked out"". ""Then I contacted my publishers, and they freaked out, too,"" she says. ""They were like, 'ABBA are absolutely going to say no to this, and you have to change it.'""  In a panic, the singer re-recorded the song with an alternate (but inferior) guitar hook. ""But then I was like, 'You know what? This is crazy. I'm sure I can figure this out.'  ""So I called up Elton John and I said, 'Elton, do you know Benny or Bjorn from Abba?'"" Of course, he did.  Through a contact at Universal Music, Elton sent the song to Sweden, accompanied by a handwritten letter from Sawayama herself. ""I said: 'Look, I love your music. I'm happy to split the publishing. I'm so sorry, I didn't mean this to happen.'"" Days later, Benny Andersson replied, saying the riff had been approved: ""No problem. Absolutely fine. All the best."" ""So that song,"" Sawayama beams, ""has the blessing of ABBA!"" She might come endorsed by pop royalty but, in person, Sawayama is gratifyingly low-key.  We chat backstage at the Latitude festival, where her dressing room contains a single white sofa, one small mirror and kit bag containing her stage outfit. She makes herself a paper cup of green tea from a communal urn and settles in for a chat.  It's our third interview but, thanks to Covid, the first time we've met in person. So what was it like becoming a pop star in the middle of a pandemic? ""Absolutely surreal,"" she says. ""I lived in perpetual confusion and a bit of guilt, because things were going well work-wise, but I knew that wasn't the experience for most of the world."" In a strange way, lockdown lit a rocket under her career. Sawayama was singing about family trauma, alienation and depression at a time when many people were locked up with their families, or living alone with no prospect of escape. ""I think people were ready to get deep with their emotions, because who else were you going to talk to?"" she says. Her follow-up is no less exposing.  Called Hold The Girl, ""it's about looking back on your childhood as an adult"" and, in Sawayama's case, revisiting some deeply unpleasant memories. ""I grew up with immigrant parents who were fighting and separating,"" she says, ""and I was often caught between my mum and my dad, who would bad-talk each other to me"". After her parents split, Sawayama and her mother were left to fend for themselves. Home life was a constant ""culture clash"", she says. Her mum's limited English meant she couldn't help with schoolwork; while Sawayama's immersion in British pop culture alienated her from the family. By the age of 13, she was drinking every week. ""We'd get a three-litre Fanta and pour a whole bottle of vodka into it,"" before sneaking into parties and hanging around Camden on school nights.  Those experiences inform the darker corners of her new album. She's reluctant to go into specifics, but describes a ""loss of innocence"", while talking ominously about the seediness of the city before #MeToo. ""It was the era of Britney and Christina and it was OK to talk about young women in a certain way, and so we internalised that as young girls,"" she says.  ""I think we just grew up too quickly. We were thinking about sex in a terrible way, a completely confused way."" On a song called Phantom, Sawayama says she ""gave a little too much away"" in her search for love and acceptance. Her anger boils over on Your Age, where she sings: ""You crossed the line... those decisions were not mine.""  Frankenstein is about a partner she hoped would solve all her problems. ""I'd be like, 'put me back together', when it's not actually their job"". Realising that she needed to work these issues out for herself, Sawayama doubled down on therapy, confronting her past and making peace with her teenage self. Her treatment dovetailed with recording sessions. Sawayama says she would frequently turn up to the studio in ""floods of tears"" after some devastating revelation ""and kind of flush it out"" through the music.  One such session produced Holy, about the Catholic school where she was taught being queer was a sin. (""I found my peace when I lost my religion,"" she hollers proudly). Another led to the disarmingly tender Catch Me In The Air; where Sawayama sings about her complex relationship with her mother. ""The first verse is from my mum's perspective and how excited new parents are when they have a child. And then the second verse is me talking about how constricting it was sometimes at home.  ""But the whole idea is that you catch each other when you're falling, especially when it's single parenthood."" In lesser hands, Catch Me In The Air could be mawkish, but Sawayama's reckless approach to genre saves it from schmaltz. Yes, there are airy pan-pipes in a campy nod to The Corrs, but there's also a squealing electric guitar, back-washed touches of psychedelia, and a colossal, stadium-filling hook.  Hold The Girl was blurted out in an intense period of three months last year, ""which is really serendipitous"", says Sawayama, because she was almost immediately cast in her first film role, for the Keanu Reeves blockbuster John Wick 4. She'd previously auditioned for The Matrix Resurrections, getting down to the final three for the role that eventually went to Jessica Henwick. Chad Stahelski, who was stunt co-ordinator on The Matrix, also happens to direct the John Wick series - and he turned out to be a fan. ""He phoned me up and said, 'I've seen your music videos. You obviously act on them and you can dance and learn fight sequences,'"" Sawayama recalls. ""Two days later, I was flying to Berlin. I couldn't take anyone with me, no one could visit me. I couldn't even take an acting coach."" She's not allowed to say much more about the film, in which she'll play a character called Akira. ""Keanu Reeves is in it, I can say that,"" she jokes. ""He's playing John Wick."" ""Have I kicked Keanu in the face? No, I have not. But we have fought together."" She recently saw a first cut of the film and had an out-of-body experience. ""I was like, 'Is that what I look like when I talk? Oh my God! The franchise is over and it's all my fault!'"" That remains to be seen - she wouldn't be the first pop star to come unstuck on the big screen - but music needs her more than Hollywood, anyway. And vice versa. ""Darkness used to wrap its arms around me,"" she sings on Hold The Girl's closing track. ""Now, I finally know what it feels like to be alive."" ""I genuinely feel much better. I can enjoy things without also being in pain,"" she says,  ""That's because I've done the therapy but also because I've been able to express myself creatively. So yeah, it's been amazing, but when I was going through it, it was really, really hard."" Hold The Girl is released on 16 September."

Hawkish,Nasdaq and S&P 500 hit fresh highs,2024-09-25,2017-09-29,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-41442944," Wall Street rounded out the last trading day of September on a positive note, with both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 index hitting fresh highs. By the close the S&P 500 had risen 9.3 points to 2,519.36 while the Nasdaq index climbed 42.51 points to 6,495.96. The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 23.89 points, or 0.1%, at 22,405.09 US markets seemed unfazed by the latest inflation and consumer spending figures. Consumer spending rose by just 0.1% last month, the Commerce Department said, reflecting the impact of Hurricane Harvey. Reports of President Donald Trump's meeting with former Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh to discuss his potential nomination as Fed chairman was seen as a trigger for the rise in financial shares. ""He's definitely more hawkish on the spectrum,"" said Gennadiy Goldberg, interest rates strategist at TD Securities in New York. Separately, a closely-watched measure of inflation fell to its lowest pace in August for nearly two years. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, excluding food and energy, fell to an annual rate of 1.3%. The core PCE figure is the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure, with the bank targeting a rate of 2%."
Hawkish,The day that Stephen Hawking soared like Superman,2024-09-25,2018-03-17,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/in-pictures-43430023,"In 2007 the late Stephen Hawking fulfilled a lifelong dream; to experience 'weightlessness' outside of his wheelchair. With the help of entrepreneur Peter Diamandis (seen above), Stephen Hawking was able to experience microgravity on a Zero G flight, describing the event as ""true freedom ... I was Superman for those few minutes."" Professor Hawking, who died this week, was a wheelchair user who had lived with motor neurone disease from the age of 22.  He survived five decades longer than doctors had expected. The scientist boarded a modified Boeing 727 at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida in 2007, which then performed parabolic arcs where the aircraft is in free fall, allowing the passengers to experience moments of weightlessness. The activity mimics what floating in space feels like and is used to train astronauts. In a message to Nasa astronauts on the International Space Station in 2014, Hawking said of the experience: ""People who know me well say that my smile was the biggest they'd ever seen.""

Hawkish,What Pompeo means for US foreign policy,2024-09-25,2018-03-14,By Joel Gunter,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-43398579,"Rex Tillerson never quite got his feet under the table at the State Department. In the 14 months he was in charge, he too often denied Donald Trump the absolute loyalty the president craves. In return, he was frequently and publicly undermined by Mr Trump, right up until his sacking-by-tweet on Tuesday. Mr Tillerson's brief tenure saw the department gutted by budget cuts and hamstrung by unfilled senior positions. The staff appeared to have little good to say about him. External reviews generally rated him somewhere between ineffectual and the worst secretary of state on record. But he was also seen as a bulwark against some of the president's more volatile foreign policy instincts, on Iran, North Korea, and Russia. Where Mr Trump sought to rip up treaties and trade agreements, Mr Tillerson appeared to favour stability and continuity. He will be replaced by the director of the CIA, Mike Pompeo, a hawkish, Trump loyalist whose foreign policy positions are much more closely aligned with the president's. Mr Pompeo's easy relationship with Mr Trump might boost the State Department's standing with the administration. It could also remove a key check on the White House. Here are four key foreign policy areas the appointment might most visibly play out. The president made it clear when he announced the change that his disagreement with Mr Tillerson over Iran was a factor. ""When you look at the Iran deal, I think it's terrible. I guess he thought it was OK,"" he said. ""With Mike, Mike Pompeo, we have a very similar thought process. I think it's going to go very well."" Mr Trump has railed against the Iran deal since 2015 and threatened throughout his early presidency to pull out. The Joint Comprehensive Programme of Action (JCPOA), as it is officially known, is an Obama-era deal between the US, UK, Russia, France, China, Germany and Iran, designed to limit Iran's nuclear programme in return for the lifting of sanctions. Mr Tillerson supported the deal and appeared to have some success warding the president off ripping it up, a move which would strain relations with the other powers involved, who insist the deal cannot be renegotiated. Representatives from the European nations have reportedly been meeting state department officials in recent weeks an attempt to protect the deal. That effort may now face an additional hurdle with the appointment of Mr Pompeo. As a congressman, he fiercely opposed the deal and he has been frequently critical of Iran. ""The notion that [Iran's] entry into the JCPOA would curtail Iranian adventurism, the terror threat or their malignant behaviour has proven to be fundamentally false,"" he said in October.  Mr Pompeo joins the state department just days after President Trump's surprise decision to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong-un for talks, a prospect experts agree the department, with key Korea positions unfilled, is fundamentally unprepared for. Mr Tillerson was a frequent advocate of improving diplomatic relations with North Korea, a position that won him scorn from Mr Trump. ""I told Rex Tillerson, our wonderful Secretary of State, that he is wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man"", the president tweeted in October, using a nickname for Mr Kim. Mr Pompeo has taken a much harder line on North Korea, suggesting at a security conference last year that he supported regime change and recommending during a recent Fox News appearance that the US make ""no concessions"" in negotiations with Pyongyang. If Mr Pompeo can bolster the state department's Korea expertise in short order, he may help take the US into a summit in a stronger position. But his hardline stance on Pyongyang could also scupper talks with a notoriously sensitive regime. If he steers the administration to abandoning the Iran deal before Mr Trump and Mr Kim even sit down, North Korea would arguably have even less reason to take the Americans in good faith. Mr Pompeo's loyalties to the president are perhaps most on show when it comes to Russia. As a Republican congressman, he crowed about the Democratic Party hack allegedly orchestrated by Russia. In a now-deleted tweet, he wrote: ""Need further proof that the fix was in from Pres. Obama on down? BUSTED: 19,252 Emails from DNC Leaked by WikiLeaks."" Mr Tillerson several times put himself at odds with Mr Trump by taking a harder line than the president on alleged Russian interference in the US election. By contrast, Mr Pompeo said in January there was a ""Washington-based focus on Russian interference. I want to make sure we broaden the conversation"". As CIA director, he said in October that US intelligence agencies had concluded that Russian interference did not affect the outcome of the 2016 US election - a remark the CIA later had to walk back, reasserting that the intelligence community had made no such determination. In the end, Mr Tillerson's stance on Russia may have been the final straw for him. Earlier this week, while the president conspicuously omitted to support the UK's conclusion that Russia probably directed an assassination attempt on its soil, Mr Tillerson asserted that the poison used ""clearly"" came from Russia and promised a response. Hours later, he was sacked. The appointment of Mr Pompeo may give Mr Trump a secretary of state prepared to take a softer line on alleged Russian interference in the election, but it does not remove the sharpest Russia thorn - Robert Mueller's special counsel investigation into alleged collusion.  Mr Trump's National Security Adviser HR McMaster and Secretary of Defence James Mattis are seen to have been counterweights to the president's more assertive foreign policy instincts, but both men are also rumoured to be on borrowed time, particularly Gen McMaster.  Mr Pompeo has shown a more aggressive streak. He has criticised Iranian and Russian expansionism, accusing both of meddling in Syria, and pushed back against Russia's actions in Ukraine. As CIA director, he presided over a major increase in CIA operations in Afghanistan.  His appointment, and a possible weakening of the positions of Gen McMaster and Mr Mattis, could shift the administration's policy on Syria, said analyst Charles Lister in a briefing note from the Middle East Institute.  ""Mike Pompeo's appointment as secretary of state is likely to embolden those within the Trump administration who seek to further amplify a more assertive posture within the Syrian crisis,"" he said."

Hawkish,Stephen Hawking: The book that made him a star,2024-09-25,2018-03-14,By Simon Mitton,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-43404524,"Stephen Hawking was the most remarkable author I had the privilege of working with during my career as the director of science publishing at Cambridge University Press.  In 1982, I had responsibility for his third academic book for the Press, Superspace And Supergravity.   This was a messy collection of papers from a technical workshop on how to devise a new theory of gravity.  While that book was in production, I suggested he try something easier: a popular book about the nature of the Universe, suitable for the general market.  Stephen mulled over my suggestion.  He already had an international reputation as a brilliant theoretical physicist working on rotating black holes and theories of gravity.  And he had concerns about financial matters: importantly, it was impossible for him to obtain any form of life insurance to protect his family in the event of his death or becoming total dependent on nursing care.  So, he took precious time out from his research to prepare the rough draft of a book.  At the time, several bestselling physics authors had already published non-technical books on the early Universe and black holes.  Stephen decided to write a more personal approach, by explaining his own research in cosmology and quantum theory.  As he himself pointed out it, his area of interest had ""become so technical that only a very small number of specialists could master the mathematics"" used to describe it.  For a starting point, he took some themes from a course of advanced lectures that he had recently given at Harvard University.  These had catchy titles such as ""The edge of spacetime"", ""Black holes and  thermodynamics"", and ""Quantum gravity"". In the 1980s, my office and Stephen's were in the same courtyard in central Cambridge, so I often chatted with him about publishing.  One afternoon he invited me to take a look at the first draft, but first he wanted to discuss cash.  He told me he had spent considerable time away from his research, and that he expected advances and royalties to be large.  When I pressed him on the market that he foresaw, he insisted that it had to be on sale, up front, at all airport bookshops in the UK and the US.  I told him that was a tough call for a university press.  Then I thumbed the typescript. To my dismay, the text was far too technical for a general reader.  A few weeks later he showed me a revision, much improved, but still littered with equations.   I said: ""Steve, it's still too technical - every equation will halve the market.""  He eventually removed all except one, E = mc². And he decided, fortunately, to place it with a mass market publisher rather than a university press. Bantam published A Brief History of Time in March 1988.  Sales took off like a rocket, and it ranked as a bestseller for at least five years.  Total sales approached 10 million copies.  The book's impact on the popularisation of science has been incalculable.  Stephen was an inspirational ambassador for the power of science to provide rational accounts of the physical laws governing the natural world. Dr Simon Mitton is a historian of science at the University of Cambridge"

Hawkish,Palestinian fears heightened as Israeli far right heads to power,2024-09-25,2022-12-22,By Tom Bateman,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-64037478,"I came to talk to Yasser Abu Markhiya about the attacks on his home in Hebron but he ended up lying speechless in pain in his garden after getting kicked in the groin.  Our cameras had just started recording in their house when it began.  ""Settlers with stones attacking! Settlers with stones!"" shouts my producer.  We run outside with the Palestinian family as two young Israeli men storm into their garden, followed by soldiers. One of the settlers heads straight towards us yelling at the family: ""Get out of here, leave!""  Mr Abu Markhiya strides up to him, trying to face off the threat, filming on his phone as a soldier blocks him, but the Israeli man lunges forward and kicks the Palestinian homeowner.  The assault is a sudden illustration of what we came to interview the family about: Palestinians in Hebron say they feel increasingly vulnerable to attack after Israel's recent election.  The vote saw a massive rise in support for the far right, empowering an ultranationalist hardcore of the settler movement in Hebron and elsewhere, and reigniting a culture war within Israeli society over the role of the military in the occupied territories.  After Mr Abu Markhiya is kicked, there is a standoff as we keep filming. A Palestinian activist helping the family, Badee Dwaik, shouts: ""The soldiers do nothing to protect the Palestinians. If a Palestinian did that, you would take him to jail or shoot him!""  He is voicing a frequent complaint of systematic discrimination: That Israeli settlers who commit violence against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank rarely face accountability. As if to prove the point, the man who kicked Mr Abu Markhiya walks towards his car, is given a handshake by one of the soldiers, and then he is gone.  Mr Abu Markhiya, meanwhile, is lying hurt as a neighbour tends to him. Asked about the incident, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said soldiers are required to stop acts of violence against Palestinians and if necessary detain suspects until police arrive. The police routinely say they do investigate settler violence, but rights groups say these are usually a whitewash. November's election saw the far-right Religious Zionism alliance win 14 seats in Israel's 120 seat parliament, set to make it the second most powerful force in Prime Minister-elect Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition.  Appointed to the newly expanded post of National Security minister, in charge of police in Israel and the occupied West Bank is Itamar Ben-Gvir - leader of the ultranationalist pro-settler Otzma Yehudit (Jewish Power) party, which espouses racist, anti-Arab policies.  He made his name among a young national-religious base as a gun-wielding street agitator who calls for the deportation of ""disloyal"" Arabs and for the shooting of Palestinians who throw stones. Mr Ben-Gvir has previous convictions for racist incitement and supporting a Jewish terrorist group, and is well known to the Palestinians of Hebron as he comes from one of the city's Jewish settlements.  Many fear his promotion from the radical fringes into the political mainstream will usher in a dangerous new phase, with the region already gripped by deadly IDF arrest raids in the West Bank and the most lethal wave of Palestinian attacks in years.  In Hebron this year, two Palestinians including a 16-year-old boy have been shot dead by Israeli forces during protests in the city, and a further two during alleged knife attacks on Israeli forces. One Israeli man was killed in a gun attack by a Palestinian who was subsequently shot dead.  On the day we filmed, Israeli peace activists were leading a tour meant to look at the daily realities of life here.  Hebron is a city of checkpoints and a flashpoint of the conflict and occupation. At its core are several hundred Israeli settlers who have the protection of an army and full political rights, surrounded by hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who have neither. Many consider it the occupation in its most concentrated form.  Streets in its historic centre are a dystopian mix of civilian homes and shops with doors welded shut amid militarised fences, walls and watchtowers - an area hollowed out of its once bustling Palestinian life, as only residents may enter. The Israeli army refers to these as ""sterile"" zones necessary for security. Hebron is a political heartland for the Israeli far right: settlers here voted overwhelmingly for the alliance jointly led by Mr Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, another ultranationalist figure due to be minister of finance and in charge of Israel's day-to-day running of the West Bank, governing the lives of the Palestinians there. The Israeli peace activists have come to show solidarity with Palestinians after a fortnight of growing violence and intimidation. In the weeks after the election, during an annual Jewish pilgrimage, hundreds of young Israelis attacked homes. The following weekend, an IDF soldier beat a left-wing Israeli activist who came to support Palestinian residents, while another soldier was filmed praising Mr Ben-Gvir, saying the firebrand politician would ""sort this place out."" The UN's envoy to the region Tor Wennesland condemned the violence, as did the outgoing Israeli defence minister Benny Gantz, who warned during the election that Mr Ben-Gvir threatens to set the country on fire.  Among those who had their homes attacked in the violence were Mr Abu Markhiya and his neighbour, Imad Abu Shamsiyyeh.  They have worked with the Palestinian group Human Rights Defenders over the years which has documented violence against Palestinians, something activists believe could put them at greater risk. ""They stood in this exact place and started throwing stones madly, cursing us with obscene words, and shouting racist slogans: 'Death to Arabs' and 'Get out of these houses that belong to Israel, we will take them back',"" Mr Abu Shamsiyyeh tells me. ""I was very scared for myself, my wife and my children, as there were a large number of settlers. Especially now with Ben-Gvir in the government, who has come to my house more than once,"" he says.  Mr Abu Markhiya continues: ""Since the Israeli elections, the attacks have increased and grown more fierce."" Later, the soldier who was recorded supporting Mr Ben-Gvir was jailed for several days. It fed into a heated row in Israel, with nationalists arguing the military leadership was bowing to liberal pressure to punish the country's defenders. One of those making the case was Mr Ben-Gvir himself, suggesting the activists provoked or hit the soldiers - a claim for which there was no evidence.  An old fault-line in Israeli society was being aggravated in occupied Hebron: That between hawkish nationalists and what remains of the peace camp. I watched the tensions mount in the city, as settlers rallied against visiting anti-occupation activists.  Yishai Fleisher, a well-known voice of the settler right who describes himself as the international spokesman for the Jewish Community of Hebron, talks to me as his allies yell ""traitors"" at the arriving activists.  I ask him why they are shouting, aren't the visitors just trying to expose the discriminatory realities of the city? ""Their opinion has become a total minority in Israel,"" he says. ""The jihadism that is in this town and the [Palestinian militant group] Hamas that rules this town, that is the real segregationist and apartheid-ist type of rule that can come into this place if Israel doesn't control it."" ""In this plot of land which is a tiny plot of land, our tribal lands, we certainly should have control. It's our land,"" he adds. I put it to him that it just sounds like racism - an assertion he rejects. ""We want our minorities to be successful and to be upwardly mobile. We have no problem with our minorities as long as they're law-abiding and non-jihadist,"" he says.  In the occupied West Bank there are around three million Palestinians. Around 500,000 Israelis live in settlements, all of which are considered illegal under international law - something disputed by Israel.  We leave the right-wing rally and are told by soldiers we cannot come back if we go to the peace camp activists.  We head over. Among the crowd is Tal Sagi from the group Breaking the Silence, made up of former soldiers who oppose the occupation and who try to expose its daily humiliations for Palestinians. She was conscripted as a soldier in Hebron, where she describes an interdependent relationship between the IDF and the settlers. The message from the latter, she says, is that Palestinians are ""all enemies"". ""I know what it's like to be here as a soldier. You are in such close connection with the settlers the whole time and they give you food and they talk to you and... you hear these messages all the time,"" she explains. ""I also grew up also as a settler, so something that I heard from a very young age [was]... that everyone wanted to kill me and that every Palestinian is a threat."" ""Now, after Ben-Gvir's victory, [the settlers] have even more energy and they are here with a lot of confidence and they know they have a lot of power with them in the government. So they feel very confident to say all those things and act like that,"" she adds.  As we talk the army stops the crowd moving - they have declared a closed military zone, say the activists. Eventually one of the Palestinians they were due to visit comes to them.  Issa Amro is a well-known activist and founder of Youth Against Settlements, which leads tours of Hebron. He is a vocal critic of both the Israeli forces and the Palestinian Authority, and has been arrested by both.  He has been declared a human rights defender by the EU and the UN, both of whom have previously condemned his repeated arrests.  After his speech to the Israeli peace camp, Mr Amro tries to show me how he is unable to go to his own home due to his latest arrest conditions.  But as we film, he is pulled away from us. Four undercover Israeli police, including the officer we spotted earlier, put him up against a wall and search him. He is told he is being detained for ""obstructing justice"". Like the Israeli activists and the Palestinian family attacked as we filmed, he believes the authorities simply do the bidding of the city's settler movement - now feeling more emboldened than ever after the election. But he cannot explain further as he is taken away, silenced for a few more hours again. "
Hawkish,The other US election that's hugely important,2024-09-25,2020-10-27,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2020-54504585,"""An astronaut, a pastor and an American football coach walk into the US Senate"" sounds like the beginning of a joke, but that is what could happen when winners of the 2020 general election take their seats in Congress. While attention has been hyper-focused on the battle for the White House between Donald Trump and Joe Biden, an equally important fight is underway for control of Congress on 3 November. The Democrats already have control of the House of Representatives, so they are looking to keep hold of it, while also gaining a majority in the Senate. Republicans hold a thin three-seat advantage in that chamber, and there are 35 senators up for re-election - a good many of whom are vulnerable.  A Democratic-controlled House and Senate would have the power to obstruct the plans of a second-term President Trump, or push through the agenda of a first-term President Biden. These five races, which underline the key battle lines in US politics, are some of the seats most at risk of flipping. Charismatic astronaut threatens Trump's Senate agenda This contest could have an immediate effect on the last three months of the current Trump presidency.  This is because the contest between Democrat Mark Kelly and Republican Martha McSally is a ""special race"" to fill a seat occupied by the late senator John McCain, who died in 2018.  Unlike with other races, should Mr Kelly win, the former astronaut could be seated in the US Senate as early as November 30, rather than in January.  With a current 53 seats in the Senate, President Trump has a solid Republican majority but it's not invulnerable - at least three moderates in his party have been willing to break rank with his agenda before. Should Mr Kelly arrive in the Senate next month, Mr Trump's hopes to rush through favoured policies before his first term is up could well vanish.  Former air force pilot Ms McSally, 54, was given the seat by appointment from the Republican governor. She already lost a Senate race in Arizona in 2018 and polls suggest it will be an uphill climb for her to avoid a second defeat now.  Mr Kelly also has a poignant personal story - his wife, the ex-Arizona congresswoman Gabby Giffords, was shot at a public event with constituents and suffered serious brain injuries. The couple have been among the most visible advocates for gun control since the 2011 incident. Powerful Trump ally at risk  Republican bigwig Lindsey Graham, a former Trump critic who has turned into one of his most vocal supporters, is facing a strong challenge from Jaime Harrison, a former lobbyist and chairman of the state Democratic Party. Polls put the two men on even footing going into October, though the Republican has since made up some ground. Still, according to analysts, South Carolinians are unhappy with Mr Graham's transformation from an outspoken small-government, hawkish foreign policy-focused conservative, to a full-throated backer of Trumpism.  The race was once considered Mr Graham's for the taking, but the senator has found himself vulnerable after his opponent raised a record $57m (£44m) in campaign funds in a single quarter. Mr Graham, 65, managed only half the amount.  Should the now-powerful chairman of the judiciary committee lose to Mr Harrison, 44, it would not only be a massive political upset, but also mark the first time the southern state would be represented by two black senators.  The slow death of moderate America Voters in Maine look set to punish one of the few moderate Republican senators still in office, Susan Collins, in a race that underscores just how tricky it is to be a centrist in the age of Trump. Ms Collins, 67, used to be one of the most popular senators serving in the chamber, but now trails her Democratic rival Sara Gideon.  The difficulty for Ms Collins lies in being a Republican who represents a centre-right constituency in a state where Mr Trump is deeply unpopular. She was widely criticised for backing the president's controversial 2018 Supreme Court pick, Brett Kavanaugh, despite allegations of sexual misconduct from the 1980s. Since then, she has not been able to shake off accusations of secret fealty to Mr Trump. Several groups that used to back her including Planned Parenthood, Human Rights Campaign and the League of Conservation Voters, are now supporting her rival Ms Gideon, 48. Will demographics finally favour the Democrats? Democrats have not won Georgia since 1992 but more liberal-leaning, young people are moving to the state, and Hillary Clinton did very well in the Atlanta suburbs four years ago.  Now two of the state's Senate seats are up for grabs. A regular general election pits incumbent Republican David Perdue, a former executive of the Dollar General discount chain store, against Jon Ossoff, a young former journalist. Mr Ossoff, 33, lost a special election in 2017 for the House - but now has his sights on a higher, state-wide office and is neck-and-neck with Mr Perdue, 70.  The party has a rare second chance to capture a seat in Georgia (normally only one Senate seat is up at a time) owing to a special election. Though a charismatic Democratic candidate leads the race - Raphael Warnock, a pastor at the historically black Ebenezer Baptist Church - it is far from a predictable one.  The incumbent senator Kelly Loeffler, who was appointed, is in trouble over her handling of the coronavirus.  Ms Loeffler, 49, is accused of using insider government knowledge about the virus for financial gain, and now faces challenges not only from Democrats, but also from her own party. With the Republican vote split, a run-off election is expected in January, as no candidate has 50% of the vote. Where the future of Trumpism is alive and well  This election in Alabama represents a rare bright spot for the Republican party to flip a Democrat-held seat.  Doug Jones, the incumbent Democrat, triumphed in a special election in 2017 after the Republican candidate became embroiled in a sexual abuse scandal.  The victory was an anomaly and now, the deeply conservative state is likely to vote him out, as they view the Democratic Party with scepticism.  Mr Jones trails 10 percentage points behind Republican Tommy Tuberville, a former university American football coach backed by President Trump. The race demonstrates that whatever the outcome of the presidential contest, there are parts of America where Trumpism will continue to resonate."

Officers from Cornwall and the South West Regional Organised Crime Unit (SWROCU) teamed up with Merseyside Police for Operation Medusa. It involved more than 100 officers and staff from different departments, Devon and Cornwall Police said.  Their work was focused on Newquay and Penzance, with warrants executed in Truro and St Austell. Police said they also stopped a vehicle ""with links to drugs supply"" on the M5 near Exeter. Overall, they said there were 31 arrests for a ""range"" of drug-related offences, theft of a vehicle and possession of weapons. The force said vehicles, drugs, cash and bladed weapons were seized.  Work also involved a week of action in February in areas where drug dealing was believed to have been taking place. Police said 53 people were ""safeguarded"" as a result, with more than £50,000 cash, drugs and other property seized.  Alison Hernandez, Police and Crime Commissioner for Devon, Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly, said: ""It is absolutely vital that we work with other forces to tackle the drug dealing which does so much damage in our communities.""

Hawkish,Rhodes evacuation 'like something from a film',2024-09-25,2023-07-25,By Alex Green,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-66300544,"A woman from Devon who is in Rhodes with her family said being evacuated from their hotel was ""terrifying"". Amy Walker and her family, from Dawlish, left their hotel late on Saturday, joining thousands ""scrambling"" to get on to boats. Ms Walker, her mother, and her two children - aged one and 10 - are due to fly to Bristol later. About 19,000 people have been evacuated from the Greek island since Tuesday. Speaking to BBC Radio Devon, Ms Walker said: ""We watched the smoke from the fires... all day on Saturday. ""You know, it was a real concern, I'd packed my bag by lunch time, I wanted to go but we were advised to stay in the hotel where there was food and electricity. ""We were reassured everything was OK, and the situation just got worse."" Ms Walker said of leaving the hotel: ""It was terrifying, it was like something out of a film. ""Everyone was scrambling and then we had to just ditch our luggage on the road, and walk down to the beach where there was thousands of people in the dark."" She said: ""People were scrambling to get on boats, like small RIBs that the locals had put on, at this point there was no government boats there. ""I just had to like take a minute, and we sat back, and I said 'I can't get on one of those boats, they look like they're about to sink', and we sat there for half an hour, 45 minutes before we mustered up the courage to go and get on one - more boats had come, some Navy RIBs."" Ms Walker said while trying to board one of the RIBs, a woman tried to push her from the ladder. ""She tried to push me off the ladder of the naval boat and I'd got a baby in a carrier strapped to me, she wanted to get on that ladder herself, and she was trying to do anything to get on it and save herself,"" she said.  Ms Walker said she and her family managed to get on to one of the Navy RIBs safely, which took them to a ferry further out to sea. She said they were taken to the city of Rhodes and she was grateful to have been taken in by a Greek family, and that she and her family were ""being looked after"".

Hawkish,Australia's big gamble on the US over China,2024-09-25,2021-09-21,By Frances Mao,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-58635393,"By signing the Aukus pact last week, Australia revealed where it stands in the world: It is taking the side of the US over China. It's a definitive move for a country in the Asia-Pacific region, experts say. The security deal with the US (and the UK) gives Australia a huge defence upgrade from the world's most powerful military. But it's a gift with strings attached. And there is debate over whether such a decision - made without public consultation - will play out in Australia's national interests. As China has grown in power, it has begun to challenge US dominance in the Asia-Pacific region. China has built the world's largest navy and has become increasingly assertive over contested areas such as the South China Sea.  Australia had long maintained it didn't have to choose between the two powers, but in recent years its attitude towards Beijing has hardened.   China has been suspected of interfering in Australian politics and of cyber attacks on key institutions.  Tensions were further inflamed last year when Australia called for an investigation into the origins of the coronavirus. A flurry of Chinese sanctions against Australian exports followed.  That was Australia's ""a-ha"" moment, says John Blaxland, an international security professor at the Australian National University. ""What happened was the dawning realisation that all these things that had preceded weren't benign,"" he says. ""We were talking about a country that had become surprisingly hostile."" Australia realised it needed to improve its defences - and quickly. On that front, Aukus is a big coup for the country. The pact will give Australia access to nuclear-powered submarines and long-range missiles from US technology. This ""super-enables an otherwise pedestrian middle-ranking military capability of little consequence beyond its border"", says Prof Blaxland. In the event of conflict, Australia would also for the first time have the ability to strike adversaries from a distance. ""This is about giving the Australian Defence Force a capable edge in a region where the capability of our own defence force when matched against China is going backwards,"" said Richard Maude, a former top Australian security official and now policy director at Asia Society Australia. For the US, it's a pretty big deal to share the crown jewels of its defence technology. But Washington views this ""one off"" trade as a crucial move in wider efforts to keep China at bay, experts say. As China projects naval power into the region, Australia's fleet - albeit small and some way off being completed - will be some form of counter alongside roving US forces, they add. ""We're trying to play catch-up by developing a credible deterrence to reduce prospects of war,"" says Prof Blaxland.  ""Because at the moment our deterrence is simply not credible. China can essentially act against us with a degree of impunity. That is becoming politically intolerable."" Critics argue Australia has given up its strategic ambiguity and made itself a bigger target because of the pact. ""The way in which it was announced rips away any pretence that Australia was not firmly on the side of containing China militarily,"" says Prof Allan Gyngell, president of the Australian Institute of International Affairs. Analysts warn Australia will probably face more economic retaliations from its biggest trading partner. ""The countries were a long way off returning to diplomatic normality and this only exacerbates that,"" says Dr Lai-Ha Chan from the University of Technology, Sydney. Others say Aukus also locks Australia in with the US for generations to come.  In the future, Australia may struggle to retain autonomy over decisions in its best interests. It will be reliant on foreign nuclear technology. ""We can't operate the submarines ourselves. So in effect we are ceding some of our sovereignty to the US, and maybe Britain,"" Prof Gyngell says. ""It will become therefore impossible for the major strike capacity of the Australian navy to operate without a US veto."" He says it also returns Australia to being ""a smaller partner in the Anglosphere"", despite it making noises in recent times about centring itself in Asia. ""We're hanging out again with the people we're comfortable with, ditching efforts to build closer relations with others in our region,"" Prof Gyngell says. ""That is a problem."" Mr Maude also highlights the risk where South-East Asia will ""increasingly feel that Australia regards security of the region as something that can only be managed by other major Western powers."" It's already caused some backlash within the Asean group of 10 South-East Asian nations. Indonesia has cancelled a meeting with Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison, and Malaysia has warned the pact is a ""catalyst for a nuclear arms race"". Analyst James Chin, from the University of Tasmania, says that Aukus ""reinforces the idea that the opinions of the Asean members matter little when it comes to the superpowers and how they operate in the region."" That said, some analysts say many smaller Asian nations are happy for the US, UK and Australia to make bold moves. ""In private, the pundits will tell you: 'We think you Australians are clod-hopping, ham-fisted and culturally insensitive but we don't dislike what you're actually doing. We just dislike how you're doing it - we'd like you to talk to us before you do it so we feel more included and appreciated,'"" says Prof Blaxland. Most experts say Australia has mishandled its diplomacy around Aukus. It also gravely offended France in reneging on the previous submarine deal. That's a poor sign, experts say, because international relations is as much about diplomacy - as it is about military pacts. It is in Australia's interests - and other democracies - for the US to maintain its dominance in the region, analysts say.  But scholars are fundamentally divided on the best way to achieve that. Some say a more cautious approach is needed; more hawkish voices say China won't respond to anything but a show of force. One thing seems certain - we're headed for a period of greater tension. ""We're used to East Asia being a place of calm in a world. That's no longer going to be true,"" says Prof Gyngell. ""So foreign policy and defence is going to impinge more on the lives of ordinary Australians than it has in past decades. Things are coming closer to home."""
Hawkish,Appeal over slave trader square name change,2024-09-25,2020-08-10,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-53726165,"A man has lodged an appeal against the decision to rename a square because of its association with a slave trader. Plymouth City Council announced it would change the name of Sir John Hawkins Square after the toppling of the statue of slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol in June. It plans to name it after the black Plymouth Argyle footballer Jack Leslie. Danny Bamping, from Plymouth, said he launched the legal challenge over the  local authority's ""knee-jerk"" reaction. The council confirmed it has been summoned to magistrates court for a hearing. Mr Bamping, who had to pay a £60 legal fee to lodge the appeal, said the council's decision was taken ""purely on the colour of Jack Leslie's skin"". ""He's got nothing to do with this area. Sir John Hawkins did a huge amount of stuff for Plymouth. Jack Leslie kicked a football 80 years ago for Argyle."" He said he is ""supportive"" of plans for a statue of Mr Leslie outside Plymouth Argyle's ground ""but to name this square Jack Leslie is a knee-jerk reaction"". ""At the time it [the slave trade] was legal and you've got to put it into the context of the day,"" he added. A court hearing has now been set for 11 September and Mr Bamping will have to pay the council's legal costs if he loses. Statue campaign for dropped black player Kelly Greenaway, the great, great niece of Mr Leslie, told BBC Radio Devon ""a lot of people"" were behind a petition to name the statue after the footballer in an act of ""positive recognition"". ""Why would you want a square named after a slave-trader? ""How some people must feel walking past that square, knowing that their ancestry or their history before was involved with that certain person"", she added. The council said they will have representation in court."
Hawkish,Top doctor says testing regime 'must go up a gear',2024-09-25,2020-05-14,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-52667137,"A leading doctor has said the decision to ease lockdown restrictions without proper testing was ""terrifying"". Dr Lucy-Jane Davis, chair of the British Medical Association (BMA) in the South West, said some people had waited more than 10 days for results. ""It's absolutely key to have proper testing, contact tracing and then isolating,"" she said. The Department for Health and Social Care said it was determined to make testing ""fast and simple"". Dr Davis said the prospect of people travelling without contact-tracing and proper isolation measures in place was ""frankly terrifying"". ""It's worrying for everybody that things like this are happening,"" she said ""We will see deaths."" Rosie Toom is a self-employed foot practitioner from Dawlish in Devon who was first tested on 3 May after developing symptoms. More than 10 days later she's still waiting for the results. ""Many of my clients are now ringing and having problems because they're all elderly and infirm,"" said Ms Toom. ""It just seems to make a mockery of the whole situation.  ""When they can't get any results back to you it all seems farcical really,"" she added. According to Dr Davis, the test is only about 70% accurate, but is still important because it gives authorities information about what's going on in the population. ""If you have symptoms of Covid-19 you should be self-isolating, and actually probably even if you have a negative test result. ""Really the gold standard, and where we should be aiming across the board, is to test, trace and then isolate - giving really good advice on how to isolate and make it safe across the population. ""The test is only really a part of that and we haven't got that into gear yet,"" she added. The government said it was aiming to return results within 48 hours for tests taken at dedicated sites, and within 72 hours for home tests. Roselyne Hue said that while her experience at the testing centre was ""very good"", no-one seems to know when she is likely to get her results. Ms Hue, from Calstock in Cornwall, had her test on Sunday afternoon, but while chasing up the results was told there's a ""huge backlog"", and they had no idea when the results would be available. ""It's such a worry - this has become such a concern we're all a little bit frightened. ""To the health department I would say: 'Thank you so much for giving me the opportunity of having this test done, but it's not worth very much to me if I don't get the results,'"" she added. The Department of Health said it does not have regional breakdowns available for testing in the south west at the moment, and could not provide details on the average wait time, or the number of inconclusive test results. ""As we tackle this virus we are determined to make it fast and simple for all eligible people who need a test to get a test,"" the department said."
Hawkish,Prof Hawking: A fitting way to go,2024-09-25,2018-06-15,By Pallab Ghosh,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-44500291,"Stephen Hawking said that science would take us on a path to ""the mind of God"". By that he meant that we would know everything that God would know, with the caveat, ""if there were a God, which there isn't. I'm an atheist."" On the face of it the religious ceremony at Westminster Abbey was at odds with Prof Hawking's personal views.  But hearing the choral works of Wagner, Mahler, Stravinsky, Elgar - and, of course, Holst's The Planets - filling the vast halls of the Gothic Abbey, one's mind was lifted beyond Earthly matters towards the ethereal. And that is what he did through his work, unravelling the mysteries of the Universe. As sculptures of playful angels and statues of austere gentlemen from the past gazed down, celebrities, scientists and school children alike heard tributes to a man whose work and determination to overcome his disability inspired so many.  He was the world's most famous scientist, not just because of his research but also his humanity.  A message from Prof Hawking was beamed towards the nearest black hole as his remains were laid to rest in London's Westminster Abbey.  To futuristic music specially commissioned from composer Vangelis, Stephen Hawking said: ""I have spent my life travelling across the Universe inside my mind.  ""Through theoretical physics I have sought to answer some of the great questions but there are other challenges, other big questions which must be answered, and these will need a new generation who are interested, engaged and with an understanding of science."" Despatched by a European Space Agency antenna in Spain, his broadcast will reach the Black Hole A0620-00 in 3,500 years' time. When it arrives, this message of hope will be consumed and only released  long in the future in a form of energy predicted and named after him - Hawking Radiation.  What a fitting way to go. ❝A man of great humour, he became a popular ambassador for science and was always careful to ensure that the general public had ready access to his work.❞ Read the obituary in full"

The 6ft 5in striker, who signed from Portsmouth on a free transfer in the summer, headed home Alan Judge's superb cross after 62 minutes to seal the three points at Portman Road. Crewe enjoyed an excellent first half but were unable to beat Town goalkeeper Tomas Holy, who made several outstanding saves to deny the visitors. Alex started the game brightly and Holy was called into an early save from Luke Offord's header after Harry Pickering whipped in a dangerous free-kick from the left. The visitors tested Holy again after 13 minutes when Owen Dale's fierce strike from the right was parried away by the Town keeper. The Czech goalkeeper then produced a miraculous stop to deny the Railwaymen after half an hour when he blocked Tom Lowery's effort from point-blank range following Dale's cut-back. Ipswich improved after the break and Stephen Ward's cross after 56 minutes found Hawkins but the striker's header was smothered by Will Jaaskelainen. But Hawkins did find the net for Ipswich six minutes later when he headed home Judge's teasing delivery from the left. Holy made another smart save to deny Offord after 68 minutes, and Ipswich withstood some late pressure to secure the win. Report supplied by PA Media League One official site"

Hawkish,Farmer jailed for 'hair-trap' death,2024-09-25,2018-11-06,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-46111935,"A farmer who caused the death of a young woman by failing to replace a £75 cover on the drive shaft of a milling machine has been jailed. Lauren Scott, 20, died after her hair and clothes got caught in the machine at Springfield Farm near Dawlish, Devon, in March last year. Neil Carpenter, 45, was found guilty of manslaughter by gross negligence. Sentencing him to four-and-a-half years, Judge Mr Justice Dingemans said Carpenter lied about what happened. The court heard the milling machine was powered by a power takeoff (PTO) - a drive shaft attached to a tractor. They were told PTOs should have a plastic cover, costing £75, but in this case the tubing had been broken and dented, leaving parts of the rotating shaft uncovered. See more news from Devon Mr Justice Dingemans said it was clear that Carpenter, who denied allowing Miss Scott to use the machine, had started operating the PTO and mill and that Miss Scott had taken over ""in her normal helpful way"". He said: ""I accept your remorse is genuine and that you attempted to assist Miss Scott after this dreadful entanglement. ""No sentence I pass will reflect the loss suffered.""  He added Carpenter had ""not processed"" the risk posed by the broken PTO and that his decision not to replace it was not motivated by cost saving. The traffic warden and part-time farmer previously admitted two breaches of health and safety regulations by failing to ensure Miss Scott's safety on that day, 4 March 2017, and in relation to two other volunteers in 2015. He was sentenced to 10 months to be served concurrently for those offences. After Carpenter was found guilty, Miss Scott's family said: ""The presence of a £75 PTO cover would have ensured Lauren to still be with us today. ""Let this ruling be a message to every person working within the agriculture industry.  ""Your health and safety in the workplace matters."""

Hawkish,ECB says no quick end to stimulus,2024-09-25,2017-07-20,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-40666236,"The European Central Bank (ECB) has insisted there is still a long way to go before it can call a halt to its economic stimulus programme. ECB president Mario Draghi threw cold water on speculation that the bank might wind the programme down soon. The bank is still buying 60bn euros (£53bn) of bonds a month as part of its quantitative easing (QE) programme. The ECB also kept the key interest rate for the countries that use the euro currency unchanged at 0%. Mr Draghi said: ""After a long time we are finally experiencing a robust recovery, where we only have to wait for wages and prices to follow a course towards our objective.  ""The last thing the governing council wants is an unwanted tightening and for conditions that may either slow down this process or even jeopardise it."" Claus Vistesen, chief eurozone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: ""The comment on inflation which is sticking in our head is Mr Draghi's notice to markets that: 'We are not there yet.'"" However, the euro did move sharply to a 14-month high against the dollar when at one point Mr Draghi hinted that the governing council of the ECB might start discussing reducing QE in the autumn. Neil Wilson from ETX Capital commented: ""It wasn't much but the market is super-sensitive to anything from Draghi at the moment."" Last month, Mr Draghi's speech in Sintra in Portugal was interpreted by many economists as meaning the eurozone's economic recovery would allow QE to end and for interest rates to rise. Patrick O'Donnell, senior investment manager at Aberdeen Asset Management, said: ""This is a well-choreographed attempt by Mr Draghi to make sure that financial markets don't get ahead of themselves after his more hawkish comments of late."" The QE bond-buying programme, together with ultra-low interest rates, was designed to encourage lending and fend off the threat of deflation in the eurozone. Mr Draghi said the policy had been a success: ""We have created in the last three years six million jobs, much more than any time before the crisis in the same amount of time. ""All the economic sentiment indicators and survey indicators are either at all time highs or close to them so the policies have been successful."" However, the inflation rate in the eurozone was 1.3% in June, down slightly from 1.4% in May, some way below the ECB's target of close to, but below, 2%. Mr Draghi said: ""Measures of underlying inflation remain low and have yet to show convincing signs of a pick-up, as domestic cost pressures, including wage growth, are still subdued. Underlying inflation in the euro area is expected to rise only gradually over the medium term."" Aberdeen Asset Management's Mr O'Donnell said: ""We probably won't hear anything significant out of the ECB until September, which is plenty of time for investors to digest Mr Draghi's caveat laden hawkishness. ""Mr Draghi will be hoping that today's performance is enough to give him a quiet summer."""

Elisabeth Moss had been the pre-show favourite to win best drama actress for the second season of The Handmaid's Tale, but lost out to Foy. In her acceptance speech, the British star described her time on The Crown as ""the most extraordinary two-and-a-half years of my life"". She said: ""I was given a role I never thought I would ever get a chance to play, and I met people who I will love for ever and ever. ""And the show goes on, which makes me so proud. So I dedicate this to the next cast, the next generation, and I also dedicate this to [her co-star] Matt Smith."" Olivia Colman is due to take over the role from Foy as the show enters its third season. Stephen Daldry won best directing for a drama series for The Crown. Newton was awarded best supporting actress in a drama series for her role in Westworld. ""I don't even believe in God but I'm going to thank her tonight,"" the actress said as she took to the stage to collect her trophy. Rhys picked up best leading actor in a drama series for his role in The Americans. Set in suburban Washington DC shortly after Ronald Reagan is elected president, the series tells the story of two KGB spies in an arranged marriage who are posing as Americans. ""Parts like these come along so rarely. I will forever be in your debt,"" he told series creator Joe Weisberg in his speech. Charlie Brooker, the British creator of Black Mirror and his co-writer William Bridges won best writing for a limited series. John Oliver added to the British success at the ceremony, picking up the prize for best variety talk series for Last Week Tonight with John Oliver. The Marvellous Mrs Maisel was one of the night's other biggest winners - adding five trophies to the four it won last week at the Creative Arts Emmys. The series took home best writing, directing, lead actress and supporting actress in the comedy categories, as well as one of the night's big prizes - best comedy series. The Assassination of Gianni Versace was also one of Monday's big winners - scooping best limited series, best directing for a limited series, and best lead actor in a limited series for Darren Criss. Henry Winkler won his first Emmy - supporting actor in a comedy series for his role in Barry - 42 years after he was first nominated for playing The Fonz in Happy Days. ""Skip Brittenham said to me a long time ago, 'If you stay at the table long enough, the chips come to you,' and tonight I got to clear the table,"" he said in his acceptance speech. Biggest Emmy winners (including Creative Arts awards) Jeff Daniels took home the prize for best supporting actor in a limited series or a television movie for his role in Netflix's Godless - described as a feminist western. In addition to his family and co-workers, Daniels thanked the streaming service for ""letting artists be artists"". He added: ""Little tip for you young actors - when they call and say 'Can you ride a horse?' don't lie. You will find on day one that you're in the Kentucky Derby."" Put together with the Creative Arts Emmys handed out last week, this year's awards tally saw Netflix and HBO tied, with 23 awards each. But one of the night's most memorable moments came from Glen Weiss, who proposed to his girlfriend from the stage during his speech. While accepting outstanding directing for a variety special for The Oscars, he spoke to his partner Jan Svendsen, who was sitting in the audience. ""You wonder why I don't like to call you my girlfriend? Because I want to call you my wife,"" he said as the crowd began cheering. Svendsen, who looked shocked and delighted, then made her way up to the stage to accept his proposal. Weiss said he was giving her the ring ""that my dad put on my mom's finger 67 years ago"". His proposal came just two weeks after the death of his mother, which he also referred to in his speech. Rhys joked about the moment later in the night, telling the audience as he collected his award that his girlfriend had whispered to him: ""If you propose to me I will punch you clean in the mouth."" The ceremony took place at the Microsoft Theatre in Los Angeles, with Kenan Thompson and Kate McKinnon kicking off proceedings. ""We're celebrating the fact that this year's Emmy Awards has the most diverse group of nominees in Emmy history,"" Thompson said. ""One step closer to a black Sheldon,"" he joked - referring to The Big Bang Theory's most famous character. The pair then embarked on a parody song called We Solved It - suggesting the Emmys had single-handedly fixed Hollywood's lack of diversity - which featured cameo appearances from Sandra Oh and John Legend. Ceremony hosts Colin Jost and Michael Che then took to the stage - referencing the fact that streaming service Netflix received the most nods this year in their opening monologue. ""NBC has the most nominations of any broadcast network,"" Che said, adding: ""Which is kind of like being the sexiest person on life support"". Because the Emmys have a total of 122 categories, the less high profile awards were given out last weekend at the Creative Arts Emmys, with 26 awarded on Monday night.

Hawkish,Hospital closure plans to be reviewed,2024-09-25,2021-11-12,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-59265949,"Plans to close a Devon hospital will be reviewed by independent experts after an intervention by the health secretary. Under the plans, services would move from Teignmouth Community Hospital to Dawlish Hospital. Campaigners argued against NHS Devon Clinical Commissioning Group's (CCG) plans and said hospital beds were ""desperately needed"". The CCG said it would work with the independent panel. The community hospital on Mill Lane was established 73 years ago, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said. A petition entitled 'Hands Off Teignmouth Hospital' has been supported by more than 1,000 people. Local MP, Anne Marie Morris, welcomed the decision by Sajid Javid and said: ""Having been involved with this campaign since 2014, this is a fantastic step in the right direction."" She warned if the independent panel found the changes in South Devon were not in the best interest of residents, they would probably require the CCG to re-run the consultation process, not stop the plans altogether. In his letter to Devon's health and adult care scrutiny committee, Mr Javid said: ""In light of correspondence … I have written to the Independent Reconfiguration Panel (IRP) asking them to undertake an initial assessment of this case."" Under the closure plans a new £8m health centre in Teignmouth town centre would be established. In a statement, a spokesperson for NHS Devon CCG said: ""We're aware of the referral to the Independent Reconfiguration Panel (IRP).  ""We look forward to working with the IRP as they gather the information they need to make their recommendation to the secretary of state."" Mr Javid has asked the panel to aim to report back by the middle of December 2021, ""subject to them being in receipt of all relevant information"".

Hawkish,Is Trump killing the Iran nuclear deal?,2024-09-25,2018-01-12,By Suzanne Kianpour,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-42653789,"President Donald Trump has extended sanctions relief for Iran one last time, says the White House. What does it mean? The announcement puts a question mark over the future of the nuclear accord signed by Iran and six world powers in 2015. The pact lifted economic sanctions in exchange for Tehran limiting its nuclear ambitions.  President Donald Trump was fiercely critical of the deal during his election campaign, and refused to certify it in October. European powers have repeatedly urged the US not to abandon the agreement. So why are they worried? For years, economic sanctions were imposed by the US on Iran to try to curb its nuclear programme.  These measures cut Iran off from the global financial system. Under the nuclear deal, known as the JCPOA, the US agreed to lift the sanctions by issuing executive waivers.  The White House has to verify to lawmakers that Iran is still in compliance with the terms of the agreement in order to keep the nuclear deal afloat. To do this, it has been withholding the re-imposition of these sanctions.  This comes through an executive waiver issued by the president.  US law pertaining to the Iran nuclear deal, passed during the Obama administration, requires the White House to acknowledge Iran's compliance with the deal every 90 days.  It was a way for Republicans - who were opposed to the deal - to keep a check on President Obama and US participation in the accord.   These compliance conditions have rankled with Republican President Donald Trump, who campaigned against the deal. Mr Trump has just extended the sanctions relief, but a senior administration official said ""this is the last such waiver he will issue"". The White House wants European powers to impose permanent restrictions - currently set to expire in 2025 - on Iran's uranium enrichment. Mr Trump also wants Iran's ballistic missile programme addressed. Recertification of the nuclear deal is a two-part process.  Verifying that Iran is in compliance with the nuclear deal is part of it.  However, the second part involves the White House certifying that the nuclear deal remains in the US national security interest.  The original agreement was forged between Iran and the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, plus Germany. On the campaign trail in 2016, candidate Trump repeatedly pledged to tear up the Iran deal if elected.  But since taking office, he has kept the accord alive by issuing the sanctions waivers. He has not, however, said the deal is in the US national interest. In October 2017, Donald Trump decertified part of the deal on these national security grounds. This did not amount to quitting the accord. The president kicked the fate of the agreement to Congress, demanding that lawmakers ""address the deal's many flaws"" by legislating tougher terms.  Congress had 60 days to do this, a time Mr Trump called the ""snapback window"". That deadline has passed. The Republican-controlled House would easily walk away from the JCPOA. But the ratio of Democrats to Republicans in the Senate makes this not so easy: Republicans have a narrow majority - 51 to 49.  If Trump again does not re-certify the deal then that reopens the so-called snapback window and again Congress would be in charge of coming up with negotiated terms for a revised deal. If they cannot reach an agreement, Congress could end the US role in the JCPOA.  In the House, a majority is required and in the Senate, Leader Mitch McConnell could introduce expedited legislation, bypassing the committee process - and go straight to the floor for a vote. Fifty-one votes are required to pass the Senate. Mr Trump often touts his deal-making skills and this tactic appeared designed to see if some kind of bargain could be reached to fix what he did not like about the deal.  The original snapback window passed in December unnoticed. A Senate aide tells the BBC: ""Trump asked them not to do anything in the snapback window and instead said get me a better deal."" Senior members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee - Republicans Bob Corker and Tom Cotton, as well as Democrat Ben Cardin - have been involved in coming up with new legislative text. Mr Trump's repeated excoriation of the JCPOA as the ""worst deal ever"" while electioneering sought to depict the Obama administration as weak. When he refused in October to continue to recertify the deal, the president condemned Iran as a ""fanatical regime"". In a combative speech, he accused Iran of sponsoring terrorism and proposed new sanctions. He said Iran had already violated the 2015 deal, which imposed curbs on Iran's nuclear capability in return for easing international embargoes. But UN inspectors have certified nine times that Iran is in compliance with the deal. Mr Trump's balancing act - decertify but keep the US within the accord for now - allows him to talk tough while staving off the messy consequences if it collapsed altogether. The anti-government protests that erupted across Iran in December have added a layer of complexity to an already thorny issue.  Opponents of the Iranian regime are also critical of the deal because they say it does not punish the Islamic Republic for human rights abuses and involvement in conflicts such as Yemen and Syria.  With thousands arrested and imprisoned, and reports of deaths, suicide and torture, all eyes are on what Donald Trump's next move will be.  Iranian exiles have seized on the unrest to try to lobby American lawmakers to support a tough line on the regime.  Reza Pahlavi, the son of Iran's last monarch, was on Capitol Hill on Thursday meeting with hawkish Republican lawmakers, such as Adam Kinzinger and Ted Cruz. Mr Pahlavi urged the sanctioning of Iranian officials and organisations for purported human rights abuses, as well as support for keeping Iran's telecommunications channels open. The waiver suspends sanctions on Iran for 120 days.  Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said his department is weighing further sanctions in light of the protests.  The US still maintains separate sanctions on Iran related to matters such as terrorism, human rights and ballistic missile development. A National Security Council spokesperson told the BBC: ""The US government will hold accountable individuals and entities involved in the violent suppression of peaceful protests.  ""We are examining what mechanisms we could utilize including targeted sanctions and other means."""
Hawkish,Katty Kay: A growing case of transatlantic heartburn,2024-09-25,2023-05-28,By Katty Kay,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-65724013,"America's allies are getting nervous. As more Republicans jump into the race for president, and the 2024 election kicks into high gear, some European leaders have their eyes on brewing storms in the transatlantic waters.  First, America is about to turn inwards, as countries tend to do during major elections. The push to prioritise domestic voters could well lead to some candidates in the Republican party campaigning on the promise of cutting US support for Ukraine. That's not something most Europeans are happy about.   The Republican Speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy, once warned that he doesn't intend to grant a ""blank cheque"" to Ukraine. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who is running to be the Republican nominee for president, described the war between Russia and Ukraine as a ""territorial dispute"". His Republican rival, the former president, Donald Trump, told CNN he didn't see the war in terms of winning or losing - a concerning statement for Ukraine's allies who clearly do want to win. European allies made little effort to disguise their problems with Mr Trump when he was the 45th president of the US. The prospect of him being re-elected as its 47th is seen, in the words of former EU foreign policy advisor Nathalie Tocci, as ""catastrophic."" But even before we get to the first presidential debate, the ongoing clashes between Democrats and Republicans over the debt ceiling have rocked confidence in America's political system. ""I think Europeans are getting increasingly used to the fact that this broken system, in many ways, impacts the US' global standing,"" says Ms Tocci. Raising the debt ceiling to avoid America defaulting on its bills should be a routine matter of government - but partisan politics here have made it a high-wire act with potentially devastating consequences, for the US and the global economies. Even if the two parties eventually reach a deal, the chaotic process has undermined America's reputation for competence. As one senior European official, who spoke to me on the condition of anonymity, phrased it: ""The visuals don't look good.""  Christine Lagarde, the head of the European Central Bank, was even more frank when she called the prospect a ""major, major disaster"". The German Finance Minister, Christian Lindner, bluntly suggested American politicians just needed to grow up. When your friends are telling you to grow up, you wonder what your enemies are thinking. There is consternation - ""astonishment"" is the word I heard - over how badly America is handling this budget round. Angus King, the Independent Senator from Maine, is aware of how it looks abroad: ""America pays its bills for the debts we incur - three short years ago we had bipartisan understanding of this fact. We need to get back to that - and fast.""  If Washington can't get this task right, anxious allies ask, what else might it be unable to handle? The row has already directly impacted America's national security interests. Last week, President Biden cut short his trip to Asia, in order to focus on the negotiations, skipping planned visits to Australia and Papua New. The itinerary change drew scathing comments from the Sydney Morning Herald's Matthew Knott, who said the ""snub"" played straight into China's hands.  Australia - a key US ally - had planned a meeting during Mr Biden's trip of the so-called Quad countries (India, Japan, the US, and Australia) to discuss regional security. It's hard not to imagine Beijing enjoying the spectacle of its regional adversaries rearranging their summit because US domestic politics got in the way. Which gets us to perhaps the most profound source of worry among America's European allies - a growing divide over how to best handle China. While Washington has taken an increasingly hawkish tone, Europe has a sense that it may need to forge its own path. Europeans don't want to annoy Washington, but they aren't convinced either that their security or economic priorities are the same as America's. Trade between Germany and China rose to a record level last year, solidifying China as Germany's largest trading partner. Some European leaders are vocal about not wanting to be bullied into choosing sides.  When he travelled to Beijing in April, accompanied by a bevy of French business leaders, President Emanuel Macron voiced that ambivalence - especially on the thorny issue of Taiwan. ""The paradox would be that, overcome with panic, we believe we are just America's followers,"" he told the Politico news site, ""The question Europeans need to answer … is it in our interest to accelerate [a crisis] on Taiwan? No."" This divergence has led to some clashes with US politicians: ""Our European allies need to make a decision. They must choose whether to stand with China or to stand alongside the United States, and we cannot allow them to continue to play both sides,"" Republican Congresswoman Nancy Mace of South Carolina, told the US network NBC. As the 2024 election approaches there's little indication either Republicans or Democrats will soften their stance on China. American elections are always closely watched, both by adversaries and allies. The global consequences are enormous. Most allies would say they want a US that is competent, stable, and engaged. But a potentially catastrophic battle over the debt ceiling, a possible shift in the Ukraine war effort, the chance of a second tumultuous Trump presidency and differences over China don't seem to point in that direction."
Hawkish,Trump slaps big tariffs on metal imports,2024-09-25,2018-03-01,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-43249614,"President Donald Trump is to impose steep tariffs on steel and aluminium imports next week, hitting producers like Canada and China. He said steel products face a 25% tariff, with 10% on aluminium goods. The US imports four times more steel than it exports, and is reliant on steel from more than 100 nations. Mr Trump tweeted that the US was suffering from ""unfair trade"". But the move has hit US markets, with the Dow Jones index closing down 1.7%. The value of shares in American steel manufacturers jumped significantly after the announcement. The news is likely to provoke an angry reaction from China, and analysts have expressed fears of the prospect of new trade wars. Key US allies are also at risk of being hit with higher costs, but it is not clear if any countries will be excluded from the new measures. During his presidential campaign, Mr Trump said that foreign countries were ""dumping vast amounts of steel all over the United States, which essentially is killing our steelworkers and steel companies"". And since taking office, Mr Trump said cheap imports from China were harming the viability of industry in the US, which is the world's biggest importer of steel. China isn't the only country to export the material to the US - 110 countries and territories do so. And China is only the 11th biggest exporter to the US - some US allies, including Canada, Japan and South Korea are among the 10 biggest sources of steel for the US, and they all face a big bump in costs. The recommendation to impose tariffs was made in a report by Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross. President Trump had asked him to investigate ""whether steel imports threaten to impair the national security"". Mr Trump promised to rebuild the American steel and aluminium industries, which he said had suffered ""disgraceful"" treatment from other countries, in particular China, for decades. ""When our country can't make aluminium and steel...you almost don't have much of a country,"" he said.   ""We need great steel makers, great aluminium makers for defence."" He spoke as Chinese economic adviser Liu He, a friend of Chinese President Xi Jinping, visited the White House. Mr Trump's announcement was slightly delayed amid reports of wrangling over the issue among his aides. More than a dozen metals executives, including representatives from US Steel Corp and Arcelor Mittal, joined him as he made the announcement. But officials from industries that rely on steel use have lobbied against the tariffs as they fear increased costs if they have to use more US-made metals. By Tara McKelvey, BBC White House reporter The president wants to be seen as tough on trade and China, and so do many of his top officials: Pete Navarro, a trade adviser who's tipped for promotion, has hawkish views.  So does Harry Harris, the president's pick for ambassador to Australia. Still, some advisers thought the president should take it slow.  Aides huddled behind closed doors and in a hallway on Thursday morning, and the president's announcement was postponed.  The scheduling conflict reflected a bigger clash: a fight between hardliners and those who approach trade in a more cautious manner.  Meanwhile, the boss was right where he liked to be: in the eye of the storm, and everyone was waiting for him to speak.  The US Department of Energy says the industry is recovering after a slump following the 2008 financial crisis. But it is an industry significantly weaker than it was at the turn of the millennium. In the year 2000, the US produced 112m tons of steel - a figure that had fallen to 86.5m tons in 2016. In 2000, 135,000 people were employed in the industry - a figure that fell to 83,600 in 2016. Analysis by Natalie Sherman, BBC News business reporter, New York The threat of tariffs on steel and aluminium has hovered around the Trump administration for months, with delays making the president vulnerable to criticism that he is all bark and no bite, despite his America First message. He's now silenced those mutters and handed a victory to the steel industry.  But the chaos surrounding Thursday's announcement - in which advisers apparently hoped to dissuade the president from action - underscores just how many more losers there may be. Dozens of companies in industries from car-making to construction had warned of hundreds of thousands of lost jobs, as higher prices raise costs for steel-dependent sectors such as manufacturing. Defence Secretary Jim Mattis advised that the move would cost the US support among its allies, such as Canada and South Korea. The European Union, Mexico and China have all said they are weighing retaliatory tariffs that would strike politically sensitive industries like agriculture. The last time the US imposed steel tariffs, in 2002, President George W Bush lifted them less than two years later to avoid a damaging trade war.  Steel executives told the president on Thursday that they trust his judgement. But if a trade war is the outcome of this decision, as analysts expect, it remains to be seen how many will agree."
Hawkish,Community pulls together after floods hit homes,2024-09-25,2023-09-17,By Alex Green,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-66836814,"Homes in Devon have been flooded after torrential downpours across the region. Harberton resident Jan Carne is one of the people pulling together to help out neighbours impacted by the floods. Ms Carne said she had been helping out 95-year-old neighbour Betty Baldwin, who was still upstairs in her home due to flooding and mud on the ground floor. There has been widespread flooding across the county in places such as Dawlish, Torquay, and Exeter. A Met Office thunderstorm warning remains in place across the region until 18:00 BST, with part of Devon covered by an amber thunderstorm warning until 16:00. Local resident Jonathan Bean came to Ms Baldwin's rescue at about 02:50.  He said he had to climb into the house through the kitchen window because the water was over two-feet deep at the time. Local resident Eva Snape's home has also been severely damaged in the floods. Ms Snape said she heard a crash in the middle of the night and when she went downstairs to investigate, saw her house had been flooded. She said the fire service had to knock the door down to gain entry because of the flooding, adding her home had been ""utterly destroyed"" and she and her family would have to move out for ""a while"". As well as houses being flooded, a house in Totnes was struck by lightning in the early hours of Sunday, Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service said. Crews from Buckfastleigh and Ashburton fire stations were deployed to the house at about 01:44.  The fire service said the occupant had left the property and was with neighbours when crews arrived and had sustained minor injuries from a ceiling falling down. In a post on social media, Buckfastleigh Fire Station said: ""It was evident a large surge had gone through the house and plug sockets had blown off of the wall, light switches where effected and a lamp was shattered."" The yellow weather warning, which covers south and parts of mid Wales and south-west England, covers several major cities including Swansea, Cardiff, Bristol and Plymouth. The Met Office warned of a ""small chance"" lives could be put at risk. Homes and businesses could also be in danger of flooding quickly in ""torrential downpours"", the Met Office said, with up to 2.8in (70mm) possible in some locations. Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service said it was experiencing a high number of calls due to flooding across Devon and Somerset.  It said it needed to keep emergency lines open for genuine emergencies and asked people to only contact them if there was a risk to life. A number of locations around Devon were flooded on Sunday, including Dartmouth, Torquay, and Exeter and surrounding areas, and Dawlish. A flood alert was issued by the Environment Agency - for the the Middle Exe area. They said flooding was possible for the Middle River Exe from Exebridge to Tiverton and the Rivers Haddeo, Batherm and Lowman. Meanwhile, in Dawlish, a flood warning was issued, with people urged to take action to protect themselves and their properties. The Met Office said an additional 25mm-50mm of rain was expected to fall in the area affected by the amber weather warning, on top of the 30mm-60mm that had already fallen. In areas under the warning, damage to homes and businesses is ""likely"" and could happen quickly while floodwater poses a danger to life. Buildings could also be damaged by lightning, hail or strong winds. Power cuts are likely to occur and other services to homes and businesses may well be lost. Difficult driving conditions and some road closures are to be expected while train and bus cancellations are also likely. Follow BBC News South West on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

Hawkish,I'm still a main threat for Stags - Hawkins,2024-09-25,2023-01-05,BBC Sport,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/64174486,"Oli Hawkins has scored 10 goals in 62 league appearances for Mansfield Town Mansfield Town's Oli Hawkins still regards himself as one of League Two's most dangerous target men, but says he is relishing the trust placed in him as a defender at the Stags. The 30-year-old joined Mansfield as a striker in 2021, but has largely played at centre-back under boss Nigel Clough. But he remains an option up front, and took his tally to five goals this term with the winner at Hartlepool recently. ""I enjoy both and see myself as both,"" Hawkins told BBC Radio Nottingham. ""For this club, this manager and for this team I really do like playing at the back. In this league, a lot of games suit me at the back. ""I do feel that I'm one of the best defenders in the league and I do still feel like I'm one of the main threats as a target man. ""For this current time at Mansfield I see myself as little more of a centre-half just because it's where I have been playing most and where I feel trusted."" At 6ft 6in (1.98m) tall, and with a history of covering in defence during his career, Hawkins was shuffled into the Stags backline when injuries left them short last season. He has since gone on to establish himself as a mainstay at the back, holding his spot at centre-half in a side hit hard again by injuries. ""I'm just happy to do what I'm told to do and give it all I can,"" he said. ""If that's trying to keep a clean sheet or going up front to score a goal, then that's what I'm going to do. ""Nothing will beat the feeling of scoring a goal in football. But as a defender, keeping a clean sheet is just underneath scoring a goal."" One of Hawkins' five goals this season was the winner in their FA Cup win at Barrow. Another win against the Cumbrians in the league will ensure the Stags consolidate their place in the play-off spots. This video can not be played Barrow 0-1 Mansfield Town highlights The former Ipswich and Portsmouth forward is adamant Mansfield can improve on their inconsistent first half of the season to again feature among the promotion hopefuls. ""I think we will have a good second half to the season, we have the capability to do better,"" he said. ""We definitely have the right players and I'm sure the gaffer will add a couple new faces and they will help us as well.

Hawkish,'Clandestine' way I was asked to do The Masked Singer,2024-09-25,2020-01-13,Unknown,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-51094342,No content available
Hawkish,Pressure mounts on Japan's Shinzo Abe,2024-09-25,2018-03-14,By Dr John Nilsson-Wright,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-43395476,"It is no exaggeration to say that the bolt out of the blue commitment by US President Donald Trump to sit down for talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has had a severe impact on Japan's government.  A carefully crafted, US-Japan co-ordinated strategy - of unremitting political and economic pressure on North Korea - has been a replaced by a new unilateral US policy of (albeit perhaps temporary) moderation. The shift is informed by Mr Trump's confident optimism that he will be able to reach a deal to negotiate away the North's nuclear weapons and advanced missile programme.  But the unexpected talks will have an impact in Japan not unlike the July 1971 announcement by then President Richard Nixon that he planned to travel to Beijing to meet Chairman Mao Zedong.  At that time, Japan's leaders experienced the ""nightmare"" they had struggled to avoid for the best part of two decades.  In an instant, and with barely 20 minutes of advance notice, the Japanese government had been informed that the Cold War policy of ""containment"" of China - that it had loyally sought to adhere to at the prompting of successive US administrations since 1950 - had been unilaterally ditched. Japan was left isolated and betrayed by its senior allied partner, creating a residue of distrust that rattled bilateral ties between Washington and Tokyo for years to come. For Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Mr Trump's diplomatic handbrake turn on North Korea could not have come at a worse time.  Having rushed to Washington to be the first foreign leader to meet with the president-elect in November of 2016, and relying on careful diplomatic preparation to better understand and manage America's new, mercurial and self-regarding leader, Abe may be forgiven for confidently thinking that his successful Trump Tower visit had given him an advantage with the president.  This confidence has suddenly evaporated. The Abe administration now appears not only dismayed by the lack of consultation from their US partner, but also deeply alarmed by two potential scenarios.  Historically, Japan has worried about the twin danger of being either abandoned or entrapped by its US ally. These fears are now dominating Japan's anxious assessment of what may happen at the May summit between Mr Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong-un.  Fear number one is that a transactional Trump, intent on getting an agreement with Kim to succeed where his presidential predecessors have failed, and to deflect attention away from his domestic political troubles arising from the Robert Mueller investigation, will sell the US-Japan alliance short.  The worry for Japan is that the president, in order to meet the North Korean demand for a security guarantee, will agree either to a dramatic reduction of US forces from the region (some or all of the 28,500 troops in South Korea or the 50,000 or so troops in Japan) or focus exclusively on US strategic interests at the expense of alliance interests. Mr Trump may confine himself to the long-range nuclear-armed missile challenge to the US, and he may be tempted to ignore or overlook the medium-range missile threat to Japan or other political concerns, including the unresolved fate of Japan's ""abductees"", citizens kidnapped from Japan by North Korean agents in the 1970s and 1980s.  Fear number two is that the May summit will fail to produce an agreement, and that a disgruntled Trump, having run out of diplomatic road, will feel that he has no choice but to order a military attack against the North.  War on the peninsula will then drag Japan, as America's ally, into a hugely costly and destructive war that will expose the country and its citizens to massive existential risk.  Trump's latest decision to replace the diplomacy-favouring Secretary of State Rex Tillerson with a more hawkish Mike Pompeo, who backs using military force against the North, has only heightened these fears of alliance entrapment.  Compounding this strategic, international crisis, is Mr Abe's exposure on the home front.  A long-simmering corruption and influence-peddling scandal dating from 2017 has suddenly re-surfaced, precisely at the same time as the Korea crisis.  The scandal risks implicating the prime minister's wife Akie Abe. She allegedly helped lobby for a deal allowing a controversial Osaka based school, Moritomo Gakuen, to buy state-owned land at massively reduced prices (86% below market value) on which to build a primary school. Reports in early March by Japan's progressive daily newspaper, Asahi Shimbun, suggest that officials from Japan's finance ministry, which was responsible for managing the land-deal, had selectively and deliberately removed from a number of documents submitted to Japan's parliament critical details highlighting the role of Mrs Abe and some of the questionable circumstances surrounding the land deal.  The scandal has already had a number of dramatic effects. On 9 March a local official from the Osaka finance bureau killed himself, prompting suggestions that it was a result of the scandal.  At the national level, the controversy has created sharp tensions between the cabinet and the parliament, with leading opposition politicians arguing that the government has actively sought to deceive the legislature - a grave charge in a political system that places a premium on parliamentary scrutiny.  In response, a senior bureaucrat, Nobuhisa Sagawa, the former head of the national tax agency and previously in charge of the finance ministry section responsible for handling the land-sale, has been forced to resign. His immediate boss, Taro Aso - the finance minister and deputy prime minister - is also under pressure to resign, not only from opposition politicians but even from some of his colleagues in the governing Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). The worry for Mr Abe is that the scandal will lead to demands for his resignation and potentially might even bring down his cabinet.  When the scandal first emerged in February of 2017, he publicly stated he would resign if it was revealed that either he or his wife had influenced the land-sale. The latest revelations make it harder for him to dispel the impression that there may have been some undue influence, if only implicitly.  For now, Mr Aso, the finance minister, has made it clear that he has no intention to go, and Abe has defended keeping him in post in order to get to the bottom of the procedural irregularities in the finance ministry.  However, there are two more compelling reasons for the prime minister to protect his colleague:  First, so long as Mr Aso stays in post, he acts as a political human shield for the prime minister, insulating him from direct criticism. Second, Mr Aso leads the second largest of the LDP's political factions and as such can deliver a critical number of party votes for the forthcoming LDP presidential election in September of this year.  Mr Abe hopes to win the election, securing in the process a third term as party leader and a minimum of three more years as prime minister.  It is too early to tell how much damage this second crisis will inflict on Mr Abe. The latest opinion polls reveal a 6% drop in the popularity of the government from 54% to 48%.  While bad news for the prime minister, the drop has not been as fast or as pronounced as that which took place in 2017 when the scandal first broke. Moreover, there is little evidence, so far, that the controversy is boosting the position of the opposition parties, which remain far less popular than the LDP. Paradoxically, the lifeline for the prime minister may be the North Korean crisis. The Japanese public is made increasingly anxious by developments on the peninsula and remains eager to see the May summit talks succeed. From the perspective of Japan's voters, success here most likely requires a stable and experienced government at the helm in Tokyo.  Good governance, good relationships (whether personal or national) and effective alliances depend on trust. It remains to be seen whether trust can be restored and maintained between both the governments of the United States and Japan and between Mr Abe and the Japanese electorate.

Hawkish,Hawking legacy 'will live forever',2024-09-25,2018-03-30,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-43582950,"The legacy of Prof Stephen Hawking will live forever, mourners at the theoretical physicist's funeral heard. Prof Hawking, who had motor neurone disease, died on 14 March, aged 76, at his home in Cambridge. Actor Eddie Redmayne was one of several speakers at a service at the university church, Great St Mary's. The professor's eldest son Robert, former student Prof Fay Dowker and Astronomer Royal Martin Rees also gave addresses to the congregation. As the funeral cortege arrived at the church, the bell rang out 76 times - once for each year of Prof Hawking's life. His close family, including his three children Lucy, Robert and Tim, followed behind the hearse carrying the professor's coffin. As it pulled up, the vehicle was met with applause from the hundreds gathered outside the church. An arrangement of white lilies, to represent the universe, and another of white roses representing the polar star was placed on top of his coffin. It was carried into the church by six porters from Gonville and Caius College, where Prof Hawking was a fellow for more than 50 years. The porters, who often assisted him when he visited the college for formal dinners, were asked to be pallbearers by the professor's family. Up to 500 invited family, friends and colleagues attended the private service. Among those inside the church was Eddie Redmayne, who played the role of the professor in the 2014 biographical drama The Theory of Everything. He read from Ecclesiastes 3.1-11, while eulogies were delivered by Robert Hawking and Prof Dowker. The service was officiated by the Reverend Dr Cally Hammond, Dean of Gonville and Caius College. During the service the choir of Gonville and Caius performed the choral work Beyond the Night Sky, which was originally composed as a gift to Prof Hawking for his 75th birthday party at the college last year. Other guests seen arriving at the service were Queen guitarist Brian May and actress Anita Dobson, and television presenter and comedian Dara O Briain.  Entrepreneur Elon Musk and playwright Alan Bennett had also been on the guest list. Stephen shared his work and his zest for the fundamental questions it addressed with wide audiences.  He inspired people with the excitement and importance of pure scientific enquiry and was admired and revered for his devotion, as a scholar, to the pursuit of knowledge. This high regard was demonstrated wherever in the world he gave a public lecture: the auditorium was always packed, the atmosphere electric and the applause thunderous.  Stephen was my teacher, mentor and friend.  I, like many who knew and loved him, had come to think of him as immortal and our sorrow is tinged with a feeling of disbelief that he is no longer here.  But his influence and legacy will live forever. Among the hundreds of people gathered outside the church, many said they had braved the chilly temperature and drizzle to pay their respects to a man they regarded as ""an inspiration"". Cambridge PhD Student Daisy Dixon, 28, said Prof Hawking had been an ""amazing person"". ""It's exciting that someone like that lived in my lifetime,"" the philosophy scholar said. ""It's a very sad day but it's lovely to see everyone here today to pay our respects."" Rod Crozier, who travelled from Boston, Lincolnshire, said: ""He's a very inspirational person... for what he's done in his life and what he's achieved. ""You're never going to see another like him, to be honest."" The funeral was followed by a private reception at Trinity College. A condolence book, which was opened on the morning of Prof Hawking's death, was available to members of the public in the porters' lodge of Gonville and Caius College. A service of thanksgiving for his life will take place at Westminster Abbey in London on 15 June during which time the professor's ashes will be interred next to the grave of Sir Isaac Newton who was buried there in 1727, and close to that of Charles Darwin, who was buried in 1882. The Dean of Westminster, the Very Reverend Dr John Hall, said it was ""entirely fitting"" the professor's final resting place should be ""near those of distinguished fellow scientists""."
Hawkish,Russia replaces commander of Ukraine invasion force,2024-09-25,2023-01-11,By Will Vernon in Moscow and Laura Gozzi in London,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-64235713,"President Vladimir Putin has removed Russia's top commander in Ukraine, just three months after he was installed.  Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov will now lead what Mr Putin terms a ""special military operation"".  Gen Gerasimov replaces Sergei Surovikin who has overseen recent brutal attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure. The reshuffle comes as Russians claim they are making progress in eastern Ukraine after suffering a series of military defeats in recent months.  Russia launched its invasion into Ukraine on 24 February.  Gen Gerasimov, who has been in post since 2012, is the longest-serving Russian chief of general staff of the post-Soviet era. Gen Surovikin - now his deputy - has been dubbed ""General Armageddon"" for his brutal tactics in previous wars, including Russia's operations in Syria and the heavy bombardment of the city of Aleppo in particular. Shortly after he was appointed to lead the operation in October, Russia began its campaign to destroy Ukraine's energy infrastructure, leaving millions of Ukrainian civilians without power or running water for extended periods in the depths of winter. He also oversaw Russia's withdrawal from the southern city of Kherson - a major success for the Ukrainians.  Russia's defence ministry said the decision to replace Gen Surovikin was aimed at organising ""closer contact between different branches of the armed forces and improving the quality and effectiveness of the management of Russian forces"". But the move has been seen by some as a sign that he may have gained too much power.  ""As the unified commander in Ukraine, Surovikin was becoming very powerful, and was likely bypassing [Russian Defence Minister Sergei] Shoigu and Gerasimov when talking to Putin,"" military analyst Rob Lee wrote on Twitter. Some of Russia's hawkish military bloggers, who support the war but frequently criticise the way it is being carried out, have been highly critical of Russia's military leadership, including the new head of the special operation, Gen Gerasimov. Wednesday's announcement comes as fighting continues in Soledar. The fall of Soledar may help Russian troops in their assault on the strategic city of Bakhmut, about 10km (six miles) to the south-west, providing them with a secure artillery position within range of the city.   Soledar also has deep salt mines, which could be used to station troops and store equipment, protected from Ukrainian missiles. Russia's mercenary Wagner Group has taken full credit for ""storming"" it.  On Tuesday night, the group's leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, said his forces were in full control of Soledar. However, on Wednesday the Russian defence ministry released a statement appearing to contradict his claim - or that only Wagner group troops were involved.  This led to Mr Prigozhin repeating the claim on Wednesday evening. In a short statement on Telegram, he boasted that his mercenaries had killed around 500 pro-Ukraine troops. ""The whole city is littered with the corpses of Ukrainian soldiers,"" he wrote.  Ukraine has recently made similar comments about piles of Russian bodies.  There is no independent confirmation. The US-based Maxar Technologies company has published pictures of Soledar from August and early January, showing the scale of destruction during the recent fighting. The apparent differences in Russia's official narrative surrounding the latest events around Soledar hint at divisions in the country's military leadership, particularly between the Wagner Group and the defence ministry.  For his part, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky denied that Soledar had fallen.  ""The terrorist state and its propagandists are trying to pretend"" to have achieved some successes in Soledar, Mr Zelensky said in his nightly address on Wednesday, ""but the fighting continues"". ""We do everything, without stopping for a single day, to strengthen Ukrainian defence. Our potential is growing,"" he added."

More than 270 birds have been taken to Somerset's Secret World Wildlife Rescue with ""severe"" burns on their feet. The charity said it had been inundated with juvenile gulls - nesting on industrial buildings - that fell off after the roofs became ""scalding hot"". A spokeswoman for the centre said the young birds had been placed in buckets of water to ""cool their feet down"". ""Gulls have been arriving at the centre almost by the hour over the last fortnight,"" the spokeswoman said. More than twice the number of gulls has been admitted to the centre this year compared to last, the charity said. The wildlife centre said the birds were really ""struggling with the weather conditions"". ""Hot surfaces and a lack of shade are causing many of the birds to be brought in with severe sunburn on their feet,"" a spokeswoman said. She said the centre did not want to release the birds while the temperatures remained high."
Hawkish,Why's everyone talking about this outfit?,2024-09-25,2018-03-05,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-43282430,"As always fashion and the Oscars go hand in hand... Here are the outfits trending on social media.  Olympic medallist and figure skater Adam Rippon was one of the first people to arrive on the red carpet in an unconventional outfit. Along with a suit, he was wearing a leather harness designed by the creative director of Moschino, Jeremy Scott. Rippon posted a selfie on Instagram to show off his look - which also included a leather bow tie - prior to arriving on the red carpet. ""Just something casual,"" he wrote as a caption to the picture. It got the thumbs-up from supermodel and fashion icon Tyra Banks, who called the Olympic skater ""fierce"". Rippon, who is the first openly gay US winter Olympian, lit up Twitter with comments about his red carpet look: The bromance between James Ivory, director and screenwriter of Call Me by Your Name and star of the film, Timothee Chalamet continued at tonight's Oscars. Ivory, 89, who is nominated for best adapted screenplay, wore a shirt with lead actor nominee Chalamet's face on it. One of the biggest red carpet moments was 86-year-old Rita Moreno arriving in the same dress she wore when she won her Oscar in 1962 for West Side Story. The 56-year-old dress was made in Manila in the Philippines and included a new neckline but the same black opera gloves.  Tiffany Haddish wore an embroidered cape, headdress and dress called a ""zuria"". The comedian and actress, who is presenting an award tonight, explained what was behind her traditional outfit. ""My father is from Eritrea, and he passed away last year, and he said that if ever I make it here I have to honour my people. So here I am!"" Haddish caused a stir again as a presenter on stage with Maya Rudolph. She changed outfits, wearing an Alexander McQueen dress she wore at the Girls Trip premiere in July and when she hosted Saturday Night Live in November. She joked on the show that she was an ""outfit repeater"" and said the dress would be making another appearance and the comedian kept her word.  Call Me by Your Name stars Timothee Chalamet and Armie Hammer caused a storm when they appeared on the red carpet together. Hammer was too ill to attend Saturday's Independent Spirit Awards and appeared on Chalamet's phone on FaceTime at the ceremony. Fans were extremely pleased to see the pair reunited on the Oscars red carpet.  Unlike the Golden Globes and Baftas, the Oscars were awash with bright colours, with stars making a nod towards the Time's Up movement with pin badges. Tonight's fashion showcased glamorous designs, with pastels and embellishment on the top of the hot list. Elisabeth Moss, Gina Rodriguez, Salma Hayek, Sally Hawkins and Mira Sorvino all reflected this trend, which got the seal of approval on social media.  The Washington Post's Robin Givhan wrote of the colourful fashion choices, ""the solidarity seemed to be more in actions and attitude, with moments such as actress Nicole Kidman dipping into an interview with Sandra Bullock on ABC for a hug and a declaration of affection"". Lady Bird star and leading actress nominee Saoirse Ronan and her sugary-pink Calvin Klein gown was a big hit with fashion writers. Vogue's style editor Edward Barsamian praised the dress for its ""cheerful, optimistic tone"". ""The bow-trimmed gown is poised to sit alongside other memorable Oscar red carpet moments, including Nicole Kidman's mandarin-inspired Galliano for Dior Couture dress in 1997 and Julia Roberts' black and white Valentino stunner from 2001,"" he wrote.  Black Panther's Chadwick Boseman gave a nod to Wakandan fashion in his custom-made Givenchy suit. Despite the film being released too late to receive any nominations at this year's Oscars, it was still the talk of the ceremony. Fellow cast members Lupita Nyong'o and Danai Gurira also created a fashion moment on the red carpet. Marvel's Black Panther also got an honourable mention during the ceremony, with Jimmy Kimmel praising it for its commercial success and ground-breaking content.

Hawkish,Tiffany Haddish: Being black and Jewish,2024-09-25,2019-12-16,By Lebo Diseko,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-50686266,"The Eritrean-American comedian Tiffany Haddish has celebrated her Bat Mitzvah. The Jewish coming-of-age ceremony - normally marked when a girl turns 12 - signifies a stepping into religious maturity, and a commitment to keep the commandments of the Torah, the first five books of the Bible containing the foundations of Jewish law.  It was held on the same day as both her 40th birthday and the release of her Netflix comedy special Black Mitzvah, in which she pays tribute to her Jewish heritage.  Her journey reflects the experience of many black Jews who have either rediscovered their roots or felt a strong spiritual attraction to Judaism. Haddish first met her Eritrean Jewish father at the age of 27.  But it was when she took a DNA test confirming her Jewish ancestry that she really began reconnecting with the faith.  She started taking Hebrew lessons and studying the Torah, and has said her Bat Mitzvah was a way to honour her African Jewish ancestors. Haddish has said that she hopes sharing her experience will encourage other African-Americans to connect with their roots. Exactly how many people could be included in this journey is very hard to establish. That is in part because there are differing definitions of what actually makes someone Jewish.  Traditionally, Judaism is passed through the maternal line, but some see that having one Jewish grandparent is enough to establish a connection with the religion. While there are others who self-identify as Jewish. Calculating the number of Jews in Africa is impossible, according to Dr Edith Bruder author of The Black Jews of Africa. ""These are communities that are fluid,"" she told the BBC. ""There are so many ways of being a Jew in Africa."" You may also be interested in: The biggest community by far is in South Africa and is largely made up of people whose families migrated from Europe.  Ethiopian Jews, known as Beta Israel, existed in obscurity for centuries but were only recognised by the Israeli state as Jewish as recently as 1975. The vast majority of this roughly 40,000-strong community was spirited to Israel in a series of top secret operations between the end of the 1970s and 1991. But there are smaller communities across the continent, which have different origins, and different levels of formal recognition. As a consequence, the stories of black people establishing a connection with Judaism are varied. Some, like Haddish, may have their ancestry confirmed through genetic testing. Others, like Michael Lomotey, discovered their rich Jewish heritage in other ways. He grew up in the city of Hull in north-east England during the 1960s and his family were the only people of colour he knew. Both his parents were Jewish: his mother was white English and his father was black Ghanaian. But Mr Lomotey had no idea about his family's Jewish identity until he was a teenager.  ""I just thought that the behaviours that we had in the house were because of our Ghanaian heritage, which we were aware of,"" he told the BBC. He remembers his father wearing a kippah (skullcap), and being taught some Hebrew. ""But it was never talked about. Judaism or Jews were never mentioned to us."" Mr Lomotey is not sure why his parents never spoke specifically about Judaism, but when he left home at the age of 18, his father gave him a copy of the Torah. ""I just delved into it and I thought: 'This is where everything comes from.' It was like a light-bulb moment."" He says that was the beginning of a ""wonderful"" journey of discovery, which has seen him worshiping with a broad spectrum of Jewish communities, from Liberal to the ultra-Orthodox Haredi Jews.  ""I worked with some guys from the Haredi community and I'd go to shul [synagogue] with them a couple of times. They were a really interesting, really dynamic set of people."" Mr Lomotey and his family now attend a Liberal synagogue in North London.  He says what drew him to it was that ""there was a whole mix of people there - it was really diverse. There [are] black Jews there, Asian Jews, white British people"". Mr Lomotey is delighted to hear about Haddish reclaiming her Jewish roots. ""We've got to encourage people taking pride in their heritage,"" he says. ""She's embraced it publicly, and we've got to be proud of that."" There are other people who establish their Jewish identity through a different route. For many, converting is an incredibly intimate and private experience, and so it is difficult to say how many people around the world choose to do this. But someone who did was Beza Abebe.  She was born in Ethiopia to a secular family, but when she was introduced to Judaism by her now ex-boyfriend, she began a journey that would see her move to Israel to study the religion, and eventually convert. The process was not easy.  First, she had to study Hebrew for around six months just to be able to read and understand the prayers and religious texts.  ""[In all] it took me almost four years. It was a very complicated process. But I managed because so many people helped and really saw how committed I was,"" she says. When people questioned why she was willing to go through such a difficult process, Ms Abebe would explain that ""your soul is born Jewish. Even if you convert or you come to it on some kind of journey… somehow you will discover it"".  In other words, your soul knows who you are, and where you belong, and will find a way to get you there.  The news of Haddish's Bat Mitzvah has been met with congratulations from Jewish people of different backgrounds around the world. Writer and filmmaker Rebecca Pierce wrote on Twitter that ""your Bat Mitzvah and public embrace of your Jewish heritage means so much for Black Jews everywhere"".  And Haddish's friend Barbara Streisand simply said ""mazel tov [congratulations] on your Bat Mitzvah!""  Ms Abebe too joined in the congratulations: ""It really warms my heart to see someone search and seek her heritage and embrace it.  ""She adds colour and an interesting perspective to the Jewish world, especially to the American Jewish community. I watched her special and I love it! She is special,"" she told the BBC."
Hawkish,Stranger Things tops MTV Movie Awards,2024-09-25,2018-06-19,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-44534257,"Messages about tolerance, trolls and gun violence punctuated this year's MTV Movie & TV Awards, where sci-fi drama Stranger Things won the main prizes. The Netflix series won five categories, including best show; while Black Panther took four awards, including best film and best film performance. Tiffany Haddish hosted the event, spoofing both Black Panther and Cardi B's breakout hit Bodak Yellow. She also won the award for best comedic performance for Girls Trip. The MTV awards is renowned for its controversial moments, comedic film spoofs and star-studded guest lists and Sunday night's event was no different. Here are the five biggest moments from the evening.  The host of the awards wore a series of outfits, including a replica of Meghan Markle's royal wedding dress and Audrey Hepburn's outfit from Breakfast at Tiffany's, but one of her choices seemed all too familiar. Back in July last year, she wore a white Alexander McQueen gown to the premiere of her film Girls Trip, which then reappeared when she hosted Saturday Night Live in November. During a comedy monologue on SNL, she joked about being an ""outfit repeater"", so lo and behold it not only made an appearance at this year's Oscars, but also at Sunday's awards. ""Welcome back, and welcome back to my Alexander McQueen dress one more time,"" Haddish joked after coming back from an ad break.  ""If you don't have anything nice to say, just don't say it,"" she said.  ""There should be no space in this world for bullying, and I'm not going to tolerate it."" This was Millie Bobby Brown's message to bullies as she spoke via video link to accept the award for Best Performance in a TV Show, for her character Eleven in Stranger Things. It was perhaps a response to the trolling she received on Twitter, which could have been the reason she recently deleted her account on the social media platform.  The cancelling of comedian Roseanne Barr's show by ABC after she made racist remarks on Twitter was mentioned by not one, but two stars at the awards. While presenting the award for best hero, Olivia Munn said she had a real life hero of her own to thank: ""That guy who fired Roseanne"". Black Panther actor Michael B. Jordan also made a comment during his acceptance speech for best villain, saying: ""I'm shocked that I won this award for best villain. ""I thought for sure Roseanne had that in the bag."" While his co-star was the best villain, Chadwick Boseman accepted the award for best hero and best performance in a film for playing T'Challa in Black Panther. When he collected the award for the former, Boseman invited James Shaw Jr to the stage to thank him for protecting other restaurant-goers from a gunman who opened fire in a waffle house in Tennessee. He gave Shaw his popcorn trophy and said: ""This is gonna live at your house. God bless you, man."" Love, Simon was a surprise hit in cinemas and was credited with being the first mainstream teenage film to feature a gay lead character and was lauded for helping young people come out. Winning Best Kiss at the awards, stars Nick Robinson and Keiynan Lonsdale took to the stage to accept their statuette.  Lonsdale said, ""I just want to say to every kid, you can live your dreams and wear dresses.  ""You can live your dreams and kiss the one that you love, no matter what gender they are. You can live your dreams and you can believe in magic. You can live your dreams and you can be yourself."" Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

Hawkish,Brain injury centre to take Hawking name,2024-09-25,2018-09-21,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-suffolk-45602959,"A new multimillion-pound brain injury centre is to be named after world-renowned physicist Stephen Hawking.  Dr Jane Hawking, the first wife of Prof Hawking, is a patron of Headway Suffolk, which is building the facility. It will be built on the edge of Ipswich, and will provide support and housing for people with brain injuries and other neurological conditions. The charity said it was ""delighted"" to be able to use Prof Hawking's name. Prof Hawking died in Cambridge on 14 March, aged 76, having lived with motor neurone disease for more than 50 years.  Headway Suffolk approached Dr Hawking to see if it could use his name, and both she and his family have given their blessing. Dr Hawking said: ""I am sure Stephen would be as delighted as I am that the new hub for Headway Suffolk is to be named the Stephen Hawking building.  ""I am confident that this carefully planned complex will bring much comfort and relief to victims of brain injury and neurological conditions, and to their families."" Headway Suffolk said the new centre would cost at least £3m.  It will provide rehabilitation and include 24 homes where clients will have the opportunity to live as independently as they are able. The charity said it would sell its current premises at Ransomes Europark to help fund the new facility. It will also fund-raise, and is running an initiative asking people to buy bricks for 50p. Chief executive Helen Fairweather said the new centre was ""essential"". She said some people could become homeless because ""life after brain injury is difficult for the person and their family"". It is also hoped the centre will enable the charity to support more people with brain injuries and dementia in Suffolk, rather than sending them out of the county."
Hawkish,Palestinian fears heightened as Israeli far right heads to power,2024-09-25,2022-12-22,By Tom Bateman,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-64037478,"I came to talk to Yasser Abu Markhiya about the attacks on his home in Hebron but he ended up lying speechless in pain in his garden after getting kicked in the groin.  Our cameras had just started recording in their house when it began.  ""Settlers with stones attacking! Settlers with stones!"" shouts my producer.  We run outside with the Palestinian family as two young Israeli men storm into their garden, followed by soldiers. One of the settlers heads straight towards us yelling at the family: ""Get out of here, leave!""  Mr Abu Markhiya strides up to him, trying to face off the threat, filming on his phone as a soldier blocks him, but the Israeli man lunges forward and kicks the Palestinian homeowner.  The assault is a sudden illustration of what we came to interview the family about: Palestinians in Hebron say they feel increasingly vulnerable to attack after Israel's recent election.  The vote saw a massive rise in support for the far right, empowering an ultranationalist hardcore of the settler movement in Hebron and elsewhere, and reigniting a culture war within Israeli society over the role of the military in the occupied territories.  After Mr Abu Markhiya is kicked, there is a standoff as we keep filming. A Palestinian activist helping the family, Badee Dwaik, shouts: ""The soldiers do nothing to protect the Palestinians. If a Palestinian did that, you would take him to jail or shoot him!""  He is voicing a frequent complaint of systematic discrimination: That Israeli settlers who commit violence against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank rarely face accountability. As if to prove the point, the man who kicked Mr Abu Markhiya walks towards his car, is given a handshake by one of the soldiers, and then he is gone.  Mr Abu Markhiya, meanwhile, is lying hurt as a neighbour tends to him. Asked about the incident, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said soldiers are required to stop acts of violence against Palestinians and if necessary detain suspects until police arrive. The police routinely say they do investigate settler violence, but rights groups say these are usually a whitewash. November's election saw the far-right Religious Zionism alliance win 14 seats in Israel's 120 seat parliament, set to make it the second most powerful force in Prime Minister-elect Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition.  Appointed to the newly expanded post of National Security minister, in charge of police in Israel and the occupied West Bank is Itamar Ben-Gvir - leader of the ultranationalist pro-settler Otzma Yehudit (Jewish Power) party, which espouses racist, anti-Arab policies.  He made his name among a young national-religious base as a gun-wielding street agitator who calls for the deportation of ""disloyal"" Arabs and for the shooting of Palestinians who throw stones. Mr Ben-Gvir has previous convictions for racist incitement and supporting a Jewish terrorist group, and is well known to the Palestinians of Hebron as he comes from one of the city's Jewish settlements.  Many fear his promotion from the radical fringes into the political mainstream will usher in a dangerous new phase, with the region already gripped by deadly IDF arrest raids in the West Bank and the most lethal wave of Palestinian attacks in years.  In Hebron this year, two Palestinians including a 16-year-old boy have been shot dead by Israeli forces during protests in the city, and a further two during alleged knife attacks on Israeli forces. One Israeli man was killed in a gun attack by a Palestinian who was subsequently shot dead.  On the day we filmed, Israeli peace activists were leading a tour meant to look at the daily realities of life here.  Hebron is a city of checkpoints and a flashpoint of the conflict and occupation. At its core are several hundred Israeli settlers who have the protection of an army and full political rights, surrounded by hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who have neither. Many consider it the occupation in its most concentrated form.  Streets in its historic centre are a dystopian mix of civilian homes and shops with doors welded shut amid militarised fences, walls and watchtowers - an area hollowed out of its once bustling Palestinian life, as only residents may enter. The Israeli army refers to these as ""sterile"" zones necessary for security. Hebron is a political heartland for the Israeli far right: settlers here voted overwhelmingly for the alliance jointly led by Mr Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, another ultranationalist figure due to be minister of finance and in charge of Israel's day-to-day running of the West Bank, governing the lives of the Palestinians there. The Israeli peace activists have come to show solidarity with Palestinians after a fortnight of growing violence and intimidation. In the weeks after the election, during an annual Jewish pilgrimage, hundreds of young Israelis attacked homes. The following weekend, an IDF soldier beat a left-wing Israeli activist who came to support Palestinian residents, while another soldier was filmed praising Mr Ben-Gvir, saying the firebrand politician would ""sort this place out."" The UN's envoy to the region Tor Wennesland condemned the violence, as did the outgoing Israeli defence minister Benny Gantz, who warned during the election that Mr Ben-Gvir threatens to set the country on fire.  Among those who had their homes attacked in the violence were Mr Abu Markhiya and his neighbour, Imad Abu Shamsiyyeh.  They have worked with the Palestinian group Human Rights Defenders over the years which has documented violence against Palestinians, something activists believe could put them at greater risk. ""They stood in this exact place and started throwing stones madly, cursing us with obscene words, and shouting racist slogans: 'Death to Arabs' and 'Get out of these houses that belong to Israel, we will take them back',"" Mr Abu Shamsiyyeh tells me. ""I was very scared for myself, my wife and my children, as there were a large number of settlers. Especially now with Ben-Gvir in the government, who has come to my house more than once,"" he says.  Mr Abu Markhiya continues: ""Since the Israeli elections, the attacks have increased and grown more fierce."" Later, the soldier who was recorded supporting Mr Ben-Gvir was jailed for several days. It fed into a heated row in Israel, with nationalists arguing the military leadership was bowing to liberal pressure to punish the country's defenders. One of those making the case was Mr Ben-Gvir himself, suggesting the activists provoked or hit the soldiers - a claim for which there was no evidence.  An old fault-line in Israeli society was being aggravated in occupied Hebron: That between hawkish nationalists and what remains of the peace camp. I watched the tensions mount in the city, as settlers rallied against visiting anti-occupation activists.  Yishai Fleisher, a well-known voice of the settler right who describes himself as the international spokesman for the Jewish Community of Hebron, talks to me as his allies yell ""traitors"" at the arriving activists.  I ask him why they are shouting, aren't the visitors just trying to expose the discriminatory realities of the city? ""Their opinion has become a total minority in Israel,"" he says. ""The jihadism that is in this town and the [Palestinian militant group] Hamas that rules this town, that is the real segregationist and apartheid-ist type of rule that can come into this place if Israel doesn't control it."" ""In this plot of land which is a tiny plot of land, our tribal lands, we certainly should have control. It's our land,"" he adds. I put it to him that it just sounds like racism - an assertion he rejects. ""We want our minorities to be successful and to be upwardly mobile. We have no problem with our minorities as long as they're law-abiding and non-jihadist,"" he says.  In the occupied West Bank there are around three million Palestinians. Around 500,000 Israelis live in settlements, all of which are considered illegal under international law - something disputed by Israel.  We leave the right-wing rally and are told by soldiers we cannot come back if we go to the peace camp activists.  We head over. Among the crowd is Tal Sagi from the group Breaking the Silence, made up of former soldiers who oppose the occupation and who try to expose its daily humiliations for Palestinians. She was conscripted as a soldier in Hebron, where she describes an interdependent relationship between the IDF and the settlers. The message from the latter, she says, is that Palestinians are ""all enemies"". ""I know what it's like to be here as a soldier. You are in such close connection with the settlers the whole time and they give you food and they talk to you and... you hear these messages all the time,"" she explains. ""I also grew up also as a settler, so something that I heard from a very young age [was]... that everyone wanted to kill me and that every Palestinian is a threat."" ""Now, after Ben-Gvir's victory, [the settlers] have even more energy and they are here with a lot of confidence and they know they have a lot of power with them in the government. So they feel very confident to say all those things and act like that,"" she adds.  As we talk the army stops the crowd moving - they have declared a closed military zone, say the activists. Eventually one of the Palestinians they were due to visit comes to them.  Issa Amro is a well-known activist and founder of Youth Against Settlements, which leads tours of Hebron. He is a vocal critic of both the Israeli forces and the Palestinian Authority, and has been arrested by both.  He has been declared a human rights defender by the EU and the UN, both of whom have previously condemned his repeated arrests.  After his speech to the Israeli peace camp, Mr Amro tries to show me how he is unable to go to his own home due to his latest arrest conditions.  But as we film, he is pulled away from us. Four undercover Israeli police, including the officer we spotted earlier, put him up against a wall and search him. He is told he is being detained for ""obstructing justice"". Like the Israeli activists and the Palestinian family attacked as we filmed, he believes the authorities simply do the bidding of the city's settler movement - now feeling more emboldened than ever after the election. But he cannot explain further as he is taken away, silenced for a few more hours again. "
Hawkish,Voters reject town's planning blueprint,2024-09-25,2019-03-15,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-merseyside-47585233,"Voters in Middlewich have rejected a planning blueprint for the Cheshire town's development in a local referendum. A Labour Party campaign saw the so-called neighbourhood plan defeated by 1,085 votes to 1,063. The neighbourhood plan steering group said it was ""disappointing"", given four years of hard work by volunteers and councillors. However, Labour councillor Mike Hunter said it was ""a fantastic result"". Middlewich is the first town in England to reject a neighbourhood plan following the villages  Swanwick Parish Council, in Derbyshire, and Thornton Parish Council, in Hull.         Councillor Hunter told the Local Democracy Reporting Service: ""There were too many open-ended issues within this plan, which would have been bad for our town. ""The residents made a choice and that choice is to ensure that more of the electorate are involved in rewriting this plan."" Under the Localism Act 2011 neighbourhood plans gave the lowest tier of local government - town and parish councils - a chance to set development blueprints. But ""no"" campaigners insisted the plan was not good enough and that residents had not been consulted well enough. Mr Hunter added: ""The hard work starts now. We will be asking for residents to get involved in a new neighbourhood plan forum. ""We take no pleasure from the fact that four years and thousands of pounds have been wasted on a plan that was never fit for purpose."" The neighbourhood plan steering group said Labour had ""resorted to negative campaigning"" and made it ""a politically motivated bun fight"". Neighbouring Knutsford residents voted overwhelmingly to approve their own plan by 1,744 votes to 349."
Hawkish,Trump pledges 'forceful' action on Syria,2024-09-25,2018-04-10,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-43707023,"US President Donald Trump has promised a ""forceful"" response to the alleged chemical attack in Syria, as Western leaders consider what action to take. ""We have a lot of options militarily,"" he told reporters. He added that a response would be decided ""shortly"". Mr Trump said the US was getting some ""good clarity"" on who was responsible for the incident in Douma on Saturday. Medical sources say dozens were killed in the alleged attack but exact numbers are impossible to verify. Mr Trump also discussed the incident with French President Emmanuel Macron late on Monday, and both leaders expressed a desire for a ""firm response"", the Elysee Palace said. The AFP news agency quoted French government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux as saying on Tuesday that ""if a red line had been crossed, there will be a response"", adding that intelligence shared by the two leaders ""in theory confirms the use of chemical weapons"". In February Mr Macron threatened to strike Syria if proof emerged of the use of chemical weapons. UK Prime Minister Theresa May said she had spoken to Mr Macron on Tuesday morning and would be speaking to Mr Trump later in the day. Mrs May did not answer directly when asked if Britain would join the US if it decided to take a military response, saying instead: ""We believe that those responsible should be held to account.""  The condemnation from Western leaders follows a tense meeting at the UN Security Council in which the US and Russia traded harsh words over the incident. US envoy Nikki Haley has called for a vote on Tuesday on a draft resolution to set up a new inquiry into the use of chemical weapons in Syria. But Russia says it cannot support the proposal because it contains ""unacceptable elements"". Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Moscow would submit its own draft resolution proposing that inspectors from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) visit Douma. Russia wanted independent experts to be convinced that nothing had happened and would do everything to allow such a visit to take place, he added. Russian officials said on Monday that Russian military specialists and staff from Syria's Red Crescent had found no evidence of an attack. Syrian opposition activists, rescue workers and medics allege that bombs filled with toxic chemicals were dropped on Douma, in the Eastern Ghouta region, near the capital Damascus, by Syrian government forces.  The Syrian-American Medical Society said more than 500 people were brought to medical centres with symptoms ""indicative of exposure to a chemical agent"". It said this included breathing difficulties, bluish skin, mouth foaming, corneal burns and ""the emission of chlorine-like odour"". Neither the death toll nor what exactly occurred can be verified as the area is blocked off with access denied. The estimates of how many people died in the suspected chemical attack range from 42 to more than 60 people, but medical groups say numbers could rise as rescue workers gain access to basements where hundreds of families had sought refuge from bombing. The French representative at the UN Security Council said poison gas had deliberately been used as it could seep down to the basements. The US, France and UK have led international condemnation of the alleged attack, with the Syrian government and its Russian backers denying any responsibility. Ms Haley said Russia - a Syrian military backer - had the ""blood of Syrian children"" on its hands and branded President Assad a ""monster"". But Russia's UN Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia, presenting Russia's case that rebels in Douma had staged the event for their own ends, painted the incident and its fallout as part of a US-led effort to hurt Russia with a ""broad arsenal of methods"", including slander, insults and ""hawkish rhetoric"". In an angry statement, he invited the OPCW to fly to Syria as soon as Tuesday, saying that Russian troops would escort them to the site of the alleged attack. Tensions between Russia and the West have plunged to their worst level in decades, following the poisoning in March of an ex-spy in England that the UK blamed on Moscow, and alleged Russian interference in the 2016 US election. The poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia with what the British government says was a military-grade Novichok nerve agent of a type developed by Russia led to the mass expulsion of Russian diplomats by Western allies, to which Moscow responded in kind.

Hawkish,Thousands sign Hawking condolence books,2024-09-25,2018-03-24,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-43504939,"Thousands of people from around the world have signed condolence books in the wake of the death of renowned theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking. Prof Hawking, who had motor neurone disease, died on 14 March, aged 76, at his home in Cambridge. Condolence books at Gonville & Caius College have been signed by more than 2,780 people, with more than 600 people paying tribute in an online version. College master Prof Sir Alan Fersht said it was ""moved"" by the response. Hawking had been a fellow at Gonville & Caius, part of the University of Cambridge, for more than 50 years. The college said that after Prof Hawking's death so many people wanted to sign the original condolence book they had to bring in three more.  They will be bound together and presented to his family at a later date, it added. ""All of us at Gonville & Caius have been much moved by the extraordinary response to Stephen's death,"" said Prof Fersht. ""We're glad we have also offered the chance to send messages via a virtual condolence book, prompting messages from China, India, Malaysia, Australia and more.  ""It has been an honour for the college to be a focus for tributes to Stephen."" A private funeral service will take place at Great St Mary's, the University Church on 31 March, Prof Hawking's family said. His ashes will be interred at Westminster Abbey later this year."

Hawkish,Trump appoints hawkish new security chief,2024-09-25,2018-03-22,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-43509695,"President Donald Trump is replacing US National Security Adviser HR McMaster with Bush-era defence hawk and former United Nations ambassador John Bolton. Mr Trump tweeted to thank Gen McMaster, saying he had done an ""outstanding job & will always remain my friend"".  Mr Bolton, who has backed attacking North Korea and Iran, told Fox News his job would be to ensure the president has ""the full range of options"". He becomes Mr Trump's third national security chief in 14 months. Gen McMaster is the latest high-profile departure from the White House. Last week, Mr Trump fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson by a tweet, replacing him with former CIA Director Mike Pompeo. Mr Bolton's appointment does not require US Senate confirmation. He will take the job on 9 April. The National Security Adviser is the key counsellor to the president on national security and foreign policy issues, and acts as a conduit for policy proposals coming from various government departments, including defence and state. Responding to the move, Mr Bolton said he was looking forward to working with President Trump and his team ""to make our country safer at home and stronger abroad"". Mr Bolton, 69, has been a foreign policy hawk in Republican circles for decades, having served in the administrations of Ronald Reagan, George HW Bush and George W Bush. The second Bush appointed him as US envoy to the UN, during which time diplomats privately criticised Mr Bolton's style as abrasive. A strident neo-conservative, Mr Bolton helped build the case that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction, which turned out to be wrong. Known for his walrus moustache, Mr Bolton does not appear to have greatly moderated his views since his last spell in government.  He stands by the invasion of Iraq and has advocated in newspaper op-eds using military force against North Korea and Iran. Analysis by BBC North America reporter Anthony Zurcher Earlier this month, Donald Trump tweeted: ""I still have some people that I want to change"". He wasn't kidding. Since then chief economic adviser Gary Cohn, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, personal lawyer John Dowd and now National Security Adviser HR McMaster have headed to (or been shown) the exits. One explanation is that the president feels more comfortable in his job - and more willing to challenge the advice given him by his closest aides.  He has chafed at the perception that he is being ""handled"" by those around him, and is installing men who agree to action, instead of preaching caution. When it comes to Iran, Mr Bolton and the president are on the same page. Coupled with Mr Tillerson's exit, the US is heading toward a much more confrontational relationship with the Islamic Republic. In other ways, however, the former UN ambassador is an unusual choice.  Mr Trump frequently has called the Iraq war a colossal mistake - the same war that Mr Bolton enthusiastically promoted during his time in the George W Bush administration.  Candidate Trump regularly espoused non-interventionism. Mr Bolton is a hawk's hawk. Now that hawk has a perch in the Oval Office. In the US Globally In a brief statement on Thursday, Gen McMaster thanked President Trump for appointing him and said he was applying to retire from the US Army later this year. The 55-year-old three-star general is leaving after just over a year as national security adviser. The president had reportedly found Gen McMaster's briefings to be grating. He was also described as aggressive and prone to lecture. The White House said Mr Trump and Gen McMaster had ""mutually agreed"" that he would leave. He had been rumoured for weeks to be on his way out.  Gen McMaster's departure came a day after it was leaked that Mr Trump was advised this week in briefing documents not to congratulate Russian President Vladimir Putin on his recent re-election, but did it anyway. Gen McMaster replaced Lt Gen Michael Flynn, who was fired after less than a month in the job for misleading the White House about his contacts with the Russian ambassador."
Hawkish,Hawkins left out of Wales World Cup squad,2024-09-25,2023-05-01,BBC Sport,https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-union/65441832,"Hawkins played in four of Wales' matches during the Six Nations campaign this year Centre Joe Hawkins has been left out of Wales' World Cup training squad following his move to Exeter from Ospreys. There are 10 uncapped Wales players in the 54-man squad which includes former England prop Henry Thomas. Thomas is joined by Corey Domachowski, Kemsley Mathias, Keiron Assiratti, Will Davies-King, Teddy Williams, Max Llewellyn, Joe Roberts, Keiran Williams and Cai Evans. Lock Cory Hill also receives a recall. Prop Thomas, who plays for Montpellier, is included after playing seven caps for England between 2013 and 2014. The tight-head prop is available for Wales through his father and is eligible under World Rugby regulations because he last played for England more than three years ago. There is no Wyn Jones, Bradley Roberts or Rhys Patchell - who were all involved in the 2023 Six Nations squad - while Scarlets half-backs Gareth Davies and Sam Costelow and Ospreys prop Nicky Smith have been recalled. Dragons duo Taine Basham and Elliot Dee, Ospreys pair Dan Lydiate and Dewi Lake and Scarlets centre Johnny Williams have been recalled after recovering from injury. There is no room for Thomas Young, James Botham, Owen Watkin, Ross Moriarty or Morgan Morris. In March, Professional Rugby Board (PRB) chairman Malcolm Wall said the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) was reviewing the future international eligibility of Hawkins and Rowlands.  Warren Gatland was told by the PRB that Hawkins was ineligible while Rowlands was available to be picked. Those playing outside of Wales are now required to have 25 caps to represent their country after the number was dropped from 60 in February 2023. Both will play outside Wales from the end of the 2022-23 season and neither were going to reach the 25-cap threshold by that time.  Hawkins, with five caps, will join Exeter from Ospreys for the 2023-24 season, while Dragons lock Rowlands has 23 caps and joins Racing 92. Hawkins could still have been deemed available for Wales by eligibility rules if he was uncapped when he signed his Exeter contract.  He was first named in a national squad in October 2022, winning his first cap the following month against Australia.  Hawkins started the first four 2023 Six Nations games under Gatland before missing the final fixture against France because of injury. Exeter director of rugby Rob Baxter would not reveal when Hawkins officially signed for the English club but says he did expect the player to be available for Wales for the World Cup and beyond. Rowlands is in a different situation to Hawkins because he is two caps short of the threshold as he prepares to leave Newport for Paris. The 31-year-old lock was unable to add to his tally during the 2023 Six Nations because he missed the tournament with a shoulder injury. Wales have three World Cup warm-up games in August where Rowlands could make up the numbers required. Rowlands was named Wales player of the season in 2022 and has become an important member of the squad since his international debut in 2020. Hill left Cardiff before joining Yokohama Eagles in July 2021. The move initially rendered him ineligible to play for Wales then but the 32-cap lock is now available again. Ospreys centre Keiran Williams and Cardiff second-row Teddy Williams were included in the Six Nations squad but remain uncapped. Cardiff centre Max Llewellyn is leaving to join Gloucester but is eligible because he is uncapped and has not been involved officially in any previous national squads. Wales will meet up officially towards the end of June before two gruelling trainings camps in Switzerland and Turkey in July. They play England in a double-header at Principality Stadium and Twickenham on 5 August and 12 August before hosting South Africa on 19 August in Cardiff. Gatland will name in his final 33-man squad in late August before Wales open their World Cup campaign against Fiji in Bordeaux on 10 September before further group games against Portugal, Australia and Georgia. ""We've picked a large squad for a number of reasons,"" said Gatland. ""We will reduce the squad to about 45 before we go to Switzerland so there's a bit of jeopardy in the first part of the campaign. ""It's a great opportunity for some players that were involved in the Six Nations and some youngsters for the future to show us what they are capable of doing in the first part of the preparation. ""In the past we've prided ourselves on how hard we've worked and how fit the squad has been. So that's the message to the players to come in and make a statement, work really hard, make the coaches sit up and take notice and get yourself in great shape physically. ""A lot of skill work needs to be done and there's an opportunity to work on the detail you often don't get when you go into Six Nations or autumn campaigns when you have limited preparation time.""

Hawkish,Eurozone jobless rate drops to 9.1%,2024-09-25,2017-07-31,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-40774654,"The unemployment rate in the eurozone has fallen to its lowest since February 2009, according to the latest official figures. The rate dropped to 9.1% last month, from a downwardly revised 9.2% in May. Separately, inflation remained unchanged in July at 1.3%, according to a preliminary estimate from Eurostat, the European Union's statistics office. However, core inflation, which excludes food, alcohol and energy prices, rose to 1.2% from 1.1% in June. Inflation in the 19-nation bloc still remains well below the European Central Bank's target of close to, but below, 2%. Unemployment fell in all 19 eurozone member countries except Estonia. The lowest unemployment rates last month were in Germany at 3.8% and Malta at 4.1%.  Greece has the highest rate of unemployment in the eurozone at 21.7%, and also the highest rate of youth unemployment at 45.5%, although those figures refer to April - the latest data available for the country. The second highest unemployment rate was 17.1% in Spain, which was down from 19.9% a year earlier. Spain also had the second highest level of youth unemployment among 15-24 year olds at 39.2%.  The increase in the core rate of inflation had not been expected by analysts. Signs of recovery in the eurozone have led to much speculation that the European Central Bank (ECB) will soon start to cut back its 2.3 trillion euro (£2 trillion) quantitative easing (QE) programme, which has involved bond buying to try to boost the bloc's economy and avoid deflation.  ECB president Mario Draghi has previously said that sluggish core inflation and wage growth are reasons to be cautious about reining in the policy. ""Today's upside surprise in core inflation is likely to give the ECB some comfort, even though its level remains low,"" Morgan Stanley economist Daniele Antonucci said. ""We expect a QE tapering announcement this autumn.""  However, Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said the markets felt the latest data was not  strong enough ""to push the ECB in a hawkish direction"", and tighten its policy."
Hawkish,Ex-friend guilty of Scotland Street murder,2024-09-25,2017-07-27,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-40743304,"The former best friend of a man found bludgeoned to death in one of the most exclusive streets in Edinburgh has been found guilty of the murder. Kieran Davies, 28, had denied murdering Ashley Hawkins, 32, from Barry in Vale of Glamorgan, Wales, who was found dead in a flat in Scotland Street on 2 December 2016 at 05:30. Sentencing was deferred for background reports at the High Court in Edinburgh. Lord Boyd told jurors: ""Murder cases are always difficult."" He added: ""They are emotionally draining for everybody involved in it."" Police who were called to the second floor flat at 7 Scotland Street and forced entry found Mr Hawkins dead with catastrophic head injuries. Unemployed Davies was the only other occupant of the locked property and was found topless, wearing jogging bottoms and trainers extensively stained with the dead man's blood. A Reebok top, which Davies had earlier been seen wearing, was found in a washing machine, saturated with the victim's blood, along with brain tissue. The court heard Mr Hawkins had suffered at least 24 blows to the head and a metal pole and broken hammer recovered from the flat could have been used as weapons in the fatal attack. Davies, a prisoner in Edinburgh, was found guilty of murdering Mr Hawkins by repeatedly striking him on the head with weapons and repeatedly stamping and kicking him on the head and body. Police were alerted to the incident in the early hours of the morning after neighbours heard banging and shouting coming from the flat.  One teenager was aware of 15 to 20 bangs and screaming which had stopped by the end of the disturbance. The witness was confident that no one left the premises from the end of the banging until the arrival of officers. Police found the front door of the flat was locked and entry was forced and an attempt was made to resuscitate the victim who was lying face down covered with a blanket and surrounded by a pool of blood. Prosecutor David Taylor told jurors: ""When police came into that locked flat there were two people there - one alive, covered in blood and one dead, violently murdered. There is no mystery in this case."" He said Davies and Mr Hawkins had come to Edinburgh from Wales ""as best of friends"" but added there was evidence that changed and there was friction between them. Davies told police that he had taken Valium and claimed that he also had a needle of heroin and ecstasy. A blood test later proved negative for ecstasy and opiate drugs but gave an indication that he had taken diazepam and cannabis. Mr Stewart told the court that previously consideration had been given to Davies' fitness to stand trial and a psychiatrist who had seen him reported that he suffered from a delusional disorder. Det Insp Stuart Alexander, of Police Scotland's major investigation team, said: ""Davies continued to maintain his innocence throughout the investigation and trial, despite significant evidence of his guilt.  ""When officers found him in the flat, he claimed to have no recollection of Ashley's death and has given no explanation for why he took the life of a friend. ""Davies subjected Ashley to a brutal and sustained attack and we welcome this conviction. I hope this helps Ashley's loved ones as they continue to come to terms with their loss.""

Hawkish,Bank of Canada in rare interest rate rise,2024-09-25,2017-07-12,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40585509,"The Bank of Canada has raised interest rates by one quarter of a per cent for the first time in about seven years. The central bank raised its key interest rate Wednesday morning to .75 from .5, citing strong economic growth despite low inflation. The news was expected, but the hikes will have wide-ranging effects, especially on variable-rate mortgages. The Canadian dollar reached an 11-month high in anticipation of the announcement. Economic growth has been stop-and-go since the recession, with more serious setbacks in 2015 when oil prices tanked.  But it has picked up since then, with GDP growing by 3.7% in the first quarter of 2017.  Strong consumer spending, exports and investments are expected to keep the economy growing, the central bank predicts. ""The economy can handle very well this kind of move today,"" said Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz. ""Of course we'd preface that with the acknowledgement that of course interest rates are still very low."" While the US Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates slowly since 2015, this is essentially the Bank of Canada's first toe in the water.  ""It reads hawkish,"" Andrew Kelvin, senior rates strategist at TD Securities, told Reuters. ""We are probably going to see them reduce more stimulus later this year provided that the outlook holds up."" After slashing rates following the recession, the bank slowly raised them from .25% to 1% in the course of 2010, as the country showed strong signs of recovery.  But a mini-recession caused by a downturn in oil prices led to the bank lowering them back down to .5%, where they remained until Wednesday. Some economists expect interest rates to rise again in October, but Mr Poloz was coy on those prospects. ""In the full course of time, I don't doubt that interest rates will move higher, but there's no predetermined path,"" he said. Canada has one of the highest rates of consumer debt in the world, thanks in part to historically low interest rates over the past several years.  With rates on the rise, this consumer debt could could put some households in peril, and a hike in mortgage rates could trigger some housing markets to cool, say financial analysts."
Hawkish,Foo Fighters announce Taylor Hawkins tribute shows,2024-09-25,2022-06-08,By Mark Savage,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-61735945,"Rock band Foo Fighters have announced two shows this September to commemorate the life of their drummer, Taylor Hawkins. The band will play in London's Wembley Stadium on 3 September, and the Kia Forum in Los Angeles on 27 September, to honour their ""beloved bandmate"". It will be the first time they have played live since he was found dead in his hotel room in Colombia this March. The 50-year-old had been the band's drummer since 1997. No cause of death was announced, although a toxicology report showed traces of 10 substances in his body, including opioids, marijuana and anti-depressants.  Investigators did not say if the mix of drugs was a factor. September's tribute concerts have been organised by his family in conjunction with his bandmates, Dave Grohl, Nate Mendel, Chris Shiflett, Pat Smear and Rami Jaffee. In a statement, the band said they would team up with artists who inspired and were inspired by Hawkins, ""playing the songs that he fell in love with, and the ones he brought to life"". Full details of the line-up will be announced soon.  Hawkins' wife Alison also released a statement, thanking fans for their support after his death. ""Your kindness has been an invaluable comfort for my family and me during this time of unimaginable grief,"" she wrote on social media. ""As Taylor's wife, and on behalf of our children, I want to share how much you meant to him and how dedicated he was to 'knocking your socks off' during every performance. Taylor was honoured to be a part of the Foo Fighters and valued his dream role in the band every minute of his 25 years with them.  We consider every band member and the extended Foo Fighters team our family. ""Taylor's endearing spirit and deep love of music will live on forever through the collaborations he so enjoyed having with other musicians and the catalogue of songs he contributed to and created. ""In celebration of his life, it is now up to all of us who loved him most to honour Taylor's legacy and the music he gave us."" Hawkins joined Foo Fighters in 1997 as they became one of the world's biggest rock bands. A co-writer on songs like Best Of You, Learn To Fly and All My Life, he helped the band win 15 Grammy Awards - three of which were awarded posthumously this year. A beloved collaborator and foil for frontman Dave Grohl, he often stepped out from behind the drum kit to perform a cover by his favourite band, Queen.  The band cancelled all of their upcoming engagements after Hawkins' death earlier this year.  Since then, hundreds of artists have paid tribute to the musician. Fleetwood Mac's Stevie Nicks remembered his ""huge heart"" and ""glowing smile""; while Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder said he was ""someone who truly, truly loved living life on this planet"". Billie Eilish paid homage to Hawkins during her performance at April's Grammy Awards by sporting a black T-shirt with his image; while Queen's Roger Taylor compared Hawkins' death to ""losing a younger favourite brother"".

Hawkish,Who's in Putin's inner circle and running the war?,2024-09-25,2022-03-03,By Paul Kirby,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-60573261,"Vladimir Putin has often cut a solitary figure as Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine drags on, but his position is bolstered by a deeply loyal entourage that has hardly changed in years. As commander in chief, ultimate responsibility for the invasion rests with him, but he is reliant on an inner circle, many of whom began their careers in Russia's security services.  Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin was once a close and powerful ally, but never part of that circle. So who does have the president's ear at this defining moment of the war?  For months, two men have been in Prigozhin's crosshairs, Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and the head of the armed forces, Valery Gerasimov. He has accused both of responsibility for the deaths of tens of thousands of Russians in the war in Ukraine. What was a bitter and long-running feud has turned into a national crisis. If anyone has the president's ear, it is his defence minister, a long-time confidant who has in the past gone with him on hunting and fishing trips to Siberia and was once viewed as a potential successor. He has dutifully toed the Putin line, first that Russia was demilitarising Ukraine and then that it was the ""collective West"" that had launched the war, not Russia. Sometimes you wonder how much of President Putin's ear he is able to reach. This extraordinary photo was taken three days into the invasion in February 2022. Barely had Russia's military campaign begun and it was struggling with unexpected Ukrainian resistance and low military morale. ""Shoigu was supposed to be marching to Kyiv; he's minister of defence and was supposed to win it,"" said Vera Mironova, a specialist in armed conflict.  And yet he is still playing a vital role in the war, although Prigozhin accuses him of lying to the president about the reality on the ground in Ukraine. He was credited with the military seizure of Crimea in 2014. He was also in charge of the GRU military intelligence agency, accused of two nerve agent poisonings - the deadly 2018 attack in Salisbury in the UK and the near-fatal attack on opposition leader Alexei Navalny in Siberia in 2020. The picture looks even worse as a close-up. ""It looks like a funeral,"" says Ms Mironova. It may look awkward, but Russian security expert and writer Andrei Soldatov has suggested the defence minister is the most influential voice the president hears. ""Shoigu is not only in charge of the military, he's also partly in charge of ideology - and in Russia, ideology is mostly about history and he's in control of the narrative.""  As chief of staff, it was his job to invade Ukraine and complete the job fast - and by that standard, he was found wanting.  But there is a reason he is the longest-serving chief of staff since the Soviet era. Vladimir Putin clearly has faith in him. He has played a major role in Russian military campaigns ever since he commanded an army in the Chechen War of 1999, and he was at the forefront of military planning for Ukraine too, overseeing pre-war military drills in Belarus. Described as an ""unsmiling, craggy bruiser"" by Russia specialist Mark Galeotti, Gen Gerasimov also played a key role in the military campaign to annexe Crimea. Initially there was talk of him being sidelined, because of the stuttering start to the invasion of Ukraine and reports of poor morale among the troops. He failed to appear in the annual Moscow military parade in May 2022. And yet in January this year, he was appointed commander of forces in Ukraine, replacing Gen Sergei Surovikin, who is now his deputy. ""Putin cannot control every road and every battalion, and that is his role,"" said Andrei Soldatov.  ""Patrushev is the most hawkish hawk, thinking the West has been out to get Russia for years,"" says Ben Noble, associate professor of Russian politics at University College London.  He is one of three Putin loyalists who have served with him ever since the 1970s in St Petersburg, when Russia's second city was still known as Leningrad.  The other two stalwarts are security service chief Alexander Bortnikov and foreign intelligence head Sergei Naryshkin. All the president's inner circle are known as siloviki, or enforcers, but this trio are closer still. Few hold as much influence over the president as Nikolai Patrushev. Not only did he work with him in the old KGB during the communist era, he replaced him as head of its successor organisation, the FSB, from 1999 to 2008.  It was during a bizarre meeting of Russia's security council, three days before the invasion, that Mr Patrushev pushed his view that the US's ""concrete goal"" was the break-up of Russia. He has since accused the US of preparing ""biological war"", and Washington and London of leading the West in the hope of defeating Russia. When the Kakhovka dam was blown up in Russian-occupied southern Ukraine in a suspected Russian attack, he blamed Ukraine, backed up by the US, UK and their Nato allies. ""He's the one who has the chief battle cry, and there's a sense in which Putin has moved towards his more extreme position,"" says Ben Noble. Kremlin watchers say the president trusts information he receives from the security services more than any other source, and Alexander Bortnikov is seen as being part of the Putin inner sanctum. Another old hand from the Leningrad KGB, he took over the leadership of its replacement FSB when Nikolai Patrushev moved on.   The FSB has considerable influence over other law enforcement services and even has its own special forces. He's important, but he's not there to challenge the Russian leader or give advice in the same way as others, believes Andrei Soldatov. Completing the trio of old Leningrad spooks, Sergei Naryshkin has remained alongside the president for much of his career. That has not stopped President Putin giving him a televised dressing-down when he fluffed his lines on being asked for his assessment of the situation before the war.  The lengthy session was edited, so the Kremlin had clearly decided to show his discomfort in front of a big television audience. ""Putin loves playing games with his inner circle, making [Naryshkin] look a fool,"" said Andrei Soldatov. Sergei Naryshkin has long shadowed the president, in St Petersburg in the 1990s, then in Mr Putin's office in 2004 and eventually becoming speaker of parliament. But he also heads the Russian Historical Society and has proved important in providing the president with ideological grounds for his actions. He once denied in an interview with BBC Russia Editor Steve Rosenberg that Russia had carried out poisonings and cyber-attacks or had interfered in other countries' elections. For 19 years, he has been Russia's most senior diplomat, presenting Russia's case to the world, even if he is not considered to have a big role in decision-making.  Sergei Lavrov, 73, is yet more proof that Vladimir Putin heavily relies on figures from his past. He is unlikely to have cared that most of the UN human rights council walked out as he tried to defend Russia's invasion days after it began. Although a Putin loyalist from the start, he is not thought to have any role in decision-making on Ukraine. His task is to shore up support for Russia in Africa, Latin America and elsewhere, promoting his country as a decoloniser.  He has taken Russia's war rhetoric to extremes in an attempt to paint Ukraine as a ""Nazi regime"". The fact that Ukraine's president was Jewish meant nothing, he argued. ""I could be wrong, but Hitler also had Jewish blood.""  He was wrong, and offensively so.  A rare female face in the Putin entourage, she oversaw the upper house's vote to rubber-stamp the deployment of Russian forces abroad, paving the way for invasion. Valentina Matviyenko is another Putin loyalist from St Petersburg who helped steer through the annexation of Crimea in 2014 as well. But she is not considered to be a primary decision-maker. That said, few people can say with complete certainty who is calling the shots and taking the big decisions.  A former bodyguard of the president, he now runs Russia's national guard, Rosgvardia, formed by President Putin in 2016 as a kind of personal army in the style of a Roman empire-like praetorian guard. By choosing his own personal security guard to front it, he made sure of its loyalty, and Viktor Zolotov boosted its numbers to a reported 400,000. Although he has no military background, the national guard has been given a broad array of tasks to control occupied areas of Ukraine behind the front line and is said to have sustained heavy losses. The UK's defence intelligence said that Russia's security forces ""and especially the national guard"" would be key to how the Prigozhin crisis would play out. Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin has the unenviable task of rescuing the economy, but has little say over the war. Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin and the head of Rosneft state oil giant, Igor Sechin, are also close to the president, according to political analyst Yevgeny Minchenko. Billionaire brothers Boris and Arkady Rotenberg, who were childhood friends of the president, have long been close confidants too. In 2020, Forbes magazine named them as the richest family in Russia.

Hawkish,"Pink, Queen and Alanis honour Taylor Hawkins in LA",2024-09-25,2022-09-28,By Mark Savage,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-63058731,"Musicians including Pink, Queen and Def Leppard have paid tribute to Foo Fighters drummer Taylor Hawkins at a memorial concert in Los Angeles. They joined the star's former bandmates in Foo Fighters and Chevy Metal to play the songs he loved, as fans celebrated his memory. Foos frontman Dave Grohl said the show honoured the fact that ""this many people connected through one person"". Other star guests included Miley Cyrus, Rush, Cars and Mötley Crüe. Alanis Morissette - for whom Hawkins played drums before he joined Foo Fighters - gave a fierce performance of You Oughta Know; while comedian Dave Chapelle unexpectedly covered Radiohead's Creep. Pink made several appearances during the concert, joining Heart's Nancy Wilson to duet on Barracuda, before tackling Queen's Somebody To Love - a song that Hawkins often covered in concert himself - and teaming up with Foo Fighters to sing The Pretender at the show's finale. British rock band Def Leppard recalled that they had first encountered Hawkins when he was a ""20-year-old kid"" working in a guitar shop in LA. ""About five years later we did Top Of The Pops in England [and] this kid walks into the dressing room. He was playing drums for Alanis Morissette,"" recalled singer Joe Elliot. ""That was Taylor Hawkins, so in memory of. Let's do some proper songs for Taylor.""  The band played Rock Of Ages before being joined briefly by pop star Miley Cyrus for an expansive version of Photograph. ""It's like a revolving door of rock heroes tonight,"" said Grohl halfway through the concert, which also saw performances from Skid Row's Sebastian Bach, Black Sabbath's Geezer Butler and Metallica's Lars Ulrich. One of the most moving moments came when the surviving members of Nirvana, Grohl and Krist Novoselic, teamed up with fellow grunge musicians Matt Cameron and Kim Thayil of Soundgarden - who lost their lead singer Chris Cornell five years ago. Together, they played haunting versions of The Day I Tried to Live and Black Hole Sun, with vocals from Taylor Momsen of the Pretty Reckless. Rush, who are also mourning the loss of their drummer Neil Peart, played Working Man with assistance from Red Hot Chili Pepper Chad Smith and YYZ with Danny Carey of Tool. And Wolfgang Van Halen delivered flawless renditions of his father's fretwork on covers of pop-metal classics Panama and Hot For Teacher. The concert came less than a month after a previous tribute show at Wembley Stadium in London, which saw Foo Fighters joined by Sir Paul McCartney, Liam Gallagher and Supergrass. As at that concert, Hawkins' children played a key role, with his teenage son Shane stepping behind the drum kit for a blistering rendition of the Foo Fighters' hits My Hero and I'll Stick Around. Hawkins' other children Everleigh and Annabel, also appeared on stage with their mother, Alison, after Queen's Brian May played Love Of My Life - a song that Alison had requested specially. Earlier, the show had opened with Grohl's daughter Violet giving a low-key, moving performance of Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah. Six hours later, Foo Fighters closed the show with Everlong. ""This one's for Taylor,"" Grohl told the audience at LA's Kia Forum. ""We love you."" Hawkins drummed with Foo Fighters from 1997 until his death in March of this year, aged 50. No cause of death was announced, although a toxicology report showed traces of 10 substances in his body, including opioids, marijuana and anti-depressants. Investigators did not say whether the mix of drugs was a factor. Proceeds from both the London and Los Angeles tribute concerts will go to the charities Music Support and MusiCares.

Medway Council, in Kent, is to consider proposals to rebrand Chatham's Sir John Hawkins car park in Chatham in July. The Elizabethan sailor played an early role in establishing the slave trade in Britain.  Carol Stewart, of the charity Medway African and Caribbean Society, said it was a ""constant reminder of someone who tortured people"". Ms Stewart said that steps needed to be taken to change the way society views the contribution of black people to British history, suggesting greater prominence be given to nurse Mary Seacole and Chartist reformer William Cuffay. ""Don't just talk about us in terms of people who are being oppressed, talk about us as people who have made positive contributions,"" she said.  ""All we are asking for is a more balanced view of history."" Opposition Labour politicians on the council have tabled a motion to rename the car park to be discussed at a meeting on 16 July. The leading Conservative group said it could not comment ahead of the meeting. In Plymouth, the city council has announced plans to rename Sir John Hawkins Square, following objections over the link to the slave trader.  In London, mayor Sadiq Khan has announced a review of statues, plaques and street names in the wake of recent Black Lives Matter protests."

It claims that as prime minister, David Cameron, Theresa May and Boris Johnson all refused repeated requests from Ukraine to buy weapons from the UK because of fears about provoking Russian President Vladimir Putin.  The paper's leader column delivers a damning verdict on what it calls the failure of successive governments to grasp the danger posed by Moscow, noting that ""the few voices who called for a more hawkish approach were sidelined in favour of a policy amounting to appeasement"". The Sunday Express says Mr Johnson has delivered a full-throttled defence of his premiership amid what the paper describes as a firm belief in Downing Street that he can put the Partygate saga behind him. It reports that Mr Johnson highlighted 10 landmark measures due to become law this week as proof that he is delivering for Britain. But according to the Observer, plans to ditch the prime minister sooner rather than later are being advanced by a growing number of senior Conservatives. It says there is mounting alarm amongst Tories at the effects Partygate could have on their electoral chances, prompting senior MPs to urge wavering colleagues to strike before it is too late. Sign up for a morning briefing direct to your inbox The home secretary has told the Sunday Telegraph that the BBC was guilty of xenophobia when reporting the government's plan to send some asylum-seekers to Rwanda. Priti Patel says she was taken aback by the tone of BBC journalists' references to the African country when she announced the agreement 10 days ago. The BBC says its journalists asked questions about the scheme. Ms Patel also claims there were undercurrents of xenophobia in parliament - but she insists she remains fully behind the plans - and reveals she is now looking for other potential countries with which similar agreements could be struck.   A renewed call by the government's efficiency minister for civil servants to stop working at home is featured by the Mail on Sunday. Writing in the paper, Jacob Rees-Mogg warns that public sector workers based in London could be sacked if they refuse to return to Whitehall, arguing ""if people are not back in their office, it will be fair to assume the job does not need to be in London"". His view is backed by the Mail's leader column, which insists working from home is a bad habit that is ruining the economy. With the headline, ""Rishi in hot water again"", the Sunday People says the chancellor has angered voters for the second time in weeks, following the row about his wife's tax affairs. It reports that Rishi Sunak is planning to spend up to £13,000 a year heating his new swimming pool at his home in North Yorkshire. The paper says that figure is six-and-a-half times the average annual energy bill for a family home and has sparked outrage amongst his constituents at a time of soaring gas prices.

The wall at Dawlish, in Devon, is being built after the railway line was destroyed in a storm in 2014. The Town Gateway underpass will temporarily close from 13 June for up to 12 weeks. Bosses said the project would help to ""protect the coastal railway and town from storms and rising sea levels"". The closure is so engineers can install the foundations of a new bridge that will connect the two sections of the promenade. The beach and Kings Walk promenade will remain open to the public. The first section of new sea wall was completed in July 2020 and the construction of the second section began in November 2020. Julie Gregory, Network rail senior sponsor, said: ""I appreciate this closure will be disappointing for the community, especially for people with accessibility needs or those with pushchairs and particularly during the busier summer months. ""However, we will never compromise on the safety of the public or our colleagues, and to ensure we remain on course to complete the second section of sea wall and open the entire promenade and both beaches in September, it is imperative this work is completed now."" Once complete, the new wall will allow people to ""walk along a wider and safer promenade"", Network Rail said. In 2014, a storm destroyed sea defences and the railway line was closed for six weeks.

The pit, which was 6ft (1.8m) deep and 6.5ft (2m) wide, appeared under tracks after high tides engulfed the line at Teignmouth, halting services through Devon and Cornwall over the weekend. Emergency repairs were carried out overnight on Sunday.  Network Rail confirmed on Twitter that trains were running again, ""although at reduced speeds"". Replacement buses had been running between Exeter and Newton Abbot, either side of the affected lines.  However, a shortage of vehicles on Sunday led train operator Great Western Railway at one point to ""strongly advise"" passengers not to travel on Sunday. Tickets for Sunday can be used on Monday.  One landowner, who did not want to be named, said he had repeatedly warned Network Rail about problems with a culvert in the area. Julian Burnell, from Network Rail, said specialist engineers were investigating but there were not any ""very simple answers"". He said: ""Whatever we do down that line is going to have some kind of effect on some very sensitive and some very scenic and very protected landscape."" A section of the line was washed away at Dawlish in 2014, cutting off the service linking Cornwall and much of Devon with the rest of the UK for two months. Commenting on the region being cut off again, Plymouth Labour and Co-Operative MP Luke Pollard said: ""The south west has had enough and I have had enough.  ""The lack of action by government on improving our railway is causing real damage to our economy. ""It's time for ministers to put their hands in their pocket. I want to see funding announced for proper resilience at Dawlish within the next month and a commitment to fund the rail upgrades we need announced in the Autumn Budget.""

Hawkish,Asia stock markets slide on US interest rate fears,2024-09-25,2022-08-29,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-62710646,"Shares in Asia have fallen after the chairman of the US central bank said it would continue to raise interest rates to tackle soaring prices. Jerome Powell warned that the Federal Reserve's policies will cause ""some pain to households and businesses"". Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive for individuals and companies, which could slow economic growth as well as inflation. Japan's Nikkei 225 index closed 2.7% lower on Monday in Tokyo. Elsewhere in the Asia-Pacific region, the Kospi in South Korea and Australia's ASX 200 were both down by around 2%, while the Hang Seng in Hong Kong was 0.8% lower. That came after the main share indexes in New York each fell by more than 3% on Friday after Mr Powell's remarks. During a highly-anticipated speech at a conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, Mr Powell said the Federal Reserve was likely to continue raising interest rates in the coming months and could keep them high ""for some time"". He said that, while the hikes would come at a cost to American households and businesses, ""a failure to restore price stability would mean far greater pain"". Inflation in the world's largest economy by gross domestic product (GDP) is at a four-decade high. ""Fed Chair Powell went for the jugular, conveying (an) unflinching assault on inflation,"" Vishnu Varathan, head of economics and strategy at Mizuho Bank, said in a note. ""Justification for this unrelentingly hawkish posture was as plain as it was unequivocal,"" he added. Investors are also concerned that the Chinese economy is slowing, Dan Wang, chief economist at Hang Seng Bank China, told the BBC. ""The economic perspective has worsened in China due to prolonged Covid control, which means further policy rate cuts have to take place. Domestic demand is too weak without further rate cuts in China,"" she said. China's central bank cut its lending rates earlier this month after economic growth slowed sharply in the second quarter of this year. Power shortages in the Sichuan province have also hit major manufacturers of cars and smartphones in China. Over the weekend, official data showed that profits of China industrial firms had fallen by 1.1% from January to July, from a year earlier. A crisis in the country's property market is also proving to be a major challenge to government efforts to keep the economy growing."
Hawkish,Iran 'choosing dangerous path' over tanker seizure,2024-09-25,2019-07-20,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-49054586,"Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has expressed his ""extreme disappointment"" in a phone call with his Iranian counterpart following the seizure of a British-flagged tanker in the Gulf. It comes after Mr Hunt warned Iran may be choosing a ""dangerous path"" of ""illegal and destabilising"" behaviour. The Stena Impero's owners have been unable to contact the ship, which was surrounded in the Strait of Hormuz. Iran said the vessel was ""violating international maritime rules"". In the call, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif told Mr Hunt the ship must now go through a legal process, according to the Iranian news agency ISNA. A second British-owned Liberian-flagged tanker, the MV Mesdar, was also boarded by armed guards but was released on Friday. The Stena Impero was seized by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard on Friday in a key waterway in the Gulf. The tanker was surrounded by four vessels and a helicopter before heading into Iranian waters, Mr Hunt said. ""We are not looking at military options,"" he said. ""We are looking at a diplomatic way to resolve this situation."" A senior Iranian diplomat was summoned to the Foreign Office in London following the ship's seizure. Mr Hunt confirmed he had spoken to his Iranian counterpart on Saturday afternoon. He said he expressed ""extreme disappointment that having assured me last Saturday Iran wanted to de-escalate the situation they have behaved in the opposite way."" He also tweeted: ""Yesterday's action in Gulf shows worrying signs Iran may be choosing a dangerous path of illegal and destabilising behaviour after Gibraltar's legal detention of oil bound for Syria."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has also demanded the release of the tanker and its crew, urging all sides to ""show restraint"". He added in a tweet: ""Trump tearing up the Iran nuclear deal has fuelled confrontation."" Another emergency Cobra committee meeting is due to be held later. Iran's state-run IRNA news agency said the tanker was seized after it collided with a fishing boat and failed to respond to calls from the smaller craft. The vessel's owners said it was fully complying with regulations and was in international waters when it was approached. Stena Bulk said the 23 crew members, who are Indian, Russian, Latvian and Filipino, were in good health. It said it was preparing a formal request to visit those onboard the seized ship. A UK government spokeswoman told the BBC: ""We have advised UK shipping to stay out of the area for an interim period."" Iran's foreign minister Javad Zarif tweeted that the UK ""must cease being an accessory to #EconomicTerrorism of the US"". He said it was Iran that guarantees the security of the Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz.  ""Unlike the piracy in the Strait of Gibraltar, our action in the Persian Gulf is to uphold international maritime rules,"" he said. Abbasali Kadkhodaei, spokesman of the state watchdog the Guardian Council, said on Twitter that ""the law of retaliation is a recognised concept in international law"" shortly after the ship's seizure was announced. The latest developments come amid a deterioration in relations between Iran and the UK and US. Tensions between the US and Iran have risen sharply since April, when the US tightened sanctions it had reimposed on Iran after unilaterally withdrawing from a 2015 nuclear deal. The US blamed Iran for attacks on tankers in the world's key shipping area since May. Tehran denies all the accusations. On Friday, the US claimed to have destroyed an Iranian drone in the Gulf. Unlike the US, the UK government remains committed to the landmark nuclear deal, which curbs Iran's nuclear activities in return for the lifting of sanctions tensions. However, the UK infuriated Iran after its Royal Marines helped seize an Iranian tanker off Gibraltar earlier this month. On Friday, Gibraltar granted a 30-day extension to allow authorities to continue detaining the tanker, which was suspected of carrying oil to Syria in breach of EU sanctions. In retaliation for the seizure of Grace 1, Iran threatened to seize a British oil tanker. A week later, Iranian boats attempted to impede a British oil tanker in the region before being warned off by a Royal Navy ship, according to the Ministry of Defence. Iran denied any attempted seizure. Since then, the threat level to British shipping in Iranian waters in the Gulf has remained at ""critical"". A White House National Security Council spokesman said the latest incident was the second time in just over a week the UK had been ""the target of escalatory violence"" by Iran.  US President Donald Trump has responded to the developments by saying he would talk to the UK. And US Central Command said it was developing a multinational maritime effort in response to the situation. The US military said it wanted to promote maritime stability, ensure safe passage, and de-escalate tensions in international waters throughout the Arabian Gulf, Strait of Hormuz, the Bab el-Mandeb Strait and the Gulf of Oman. France and Germany called on the Iranian authorities to quickly release the Stena Impero. Germany's foreign ministry condemned the ""unjustifiable intrusion"" on shipping through the route, adding that the seizure ""further exacerbates an already strained situation"". The French foreign ministry warned that the ship's seizure ""harms the needed de-escalation of tensions"" in the region. Also calling for the release of the ship, the European Union's foreign affairs office, which represents 28 member states, expressed ""deep concern"" and urged for ""restraint to avoid further tensions"". The first thing to remember is that this specific row between Tehran and London is only one aspect of an already highly volatile situation in the Gulf. The Trump administration's decision to walk away from the international nuclear deal with Iran and to re-apply sanctions is having a hugely damaging impact on the Iranian economy. Iran is pushing back. Given the highly fragile and volatile situation in the Gulf, together with the desperate need to bolster the flagging Iran nuclear deal, was it sensible to detain the vessel carrying Iranian oil off Gibraltar? Ships must fly the flag of a nation state, explains Richard Meade, managing editor of maritime intelligence publication Lloyd's List. They must be registered in a country, but that doesn't have to be the same country as its owners, or have any relation to the cargo, he says. But there must be some link to the UK. ""But how you define UK is relative,"" Mr Meade says. The Stena Impero is Swedish-owned and those on board are Indian, Russian, Latvian and Filipino. But it's the UK flag that is important symbolically, he says. ""Historically speaking it means that the UK owes protection to the vessel."" ""The UK has political responsibilities to anything that is flagged. And that's why it's much more serious than if there just happened to be a British captain on board."" He emphasises that while it was a political issue, the impact on trade in the region had so far been minimal. But he warns that if the international community began viewing the Strait of Hormuz as a dangerous place to be, that could create a ""very different"" scenario. The defence, intelligence and diplomatic figures attending the government's Cobra crisis meetings over Iran are facing a tricky dilemma. Clearly, British-flagged or owned shipping in the Gulf needs protecting but the Royal Navy does not have enough surface ships to do the job alone. So this would have to be part of a multinational force like the proposed Operation Sentinel being discussed by US Central Command. The US Navy has plenty of ships in the Gulf - its powerful 5th Fleet is headquartered in Bahrain - but here lies the problem. Britain and its EU partners are not on the same page as Washington when it comes to the wider policy of dealing with Iran. The US has pulled out of the nuclear deal, while Europe is trying to keep it alive. So there is a reluctance by some on this side of the Atlantic to be identified too closely with a hawkish US posture towards Iran or take any actions that may be interpreted as escalating an already volatile situation.

Hawkish,Exe Estuary Trail section to close for repairs,2024-09-25,2023-07-29,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-66336353,"Part of a popular cycling and walking route around a Devon estuary will be shut for three months.  The boardwalk section, connecting Lympstone and Exmouth on the Exe Estuary Trail, needed urgent repairs, said Devon County Council. The timber Courtlands section was to be replaced after rotting with a durable fibre-reinforced material, it said. The closure would start in late September and it would let users know about diversions, it added. Pedestrians would be able to use the footpath on Exeter Road, but a spokesperson for the council said cyclists would need to cross over Exeter Road and ""follow the slightly longer route which avoids cycling on the main busy road"". They added: ""A temporary crossing will be located next to the petrol station to provide an additional safe crossing for this route."" The Exe Estuary Trail was completed by the council in 2014 and offers a 16-mile (26km), virtually traffic-free route around the estuary from Dawlish to Exmouth, said the Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS).  According to the Exe Estuary Management Partnership, it is used by more than 200,000 people each year. Follow BBC News South West on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

Hawkish,Praise for 'dynamic' Suffragette statue,2024-09-25,2018-01-24,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-leicestershire-42806025,"A statue of Suffragette Alice Hawkins, which will be unveiled in Leicester next month, has been praised by her family. Ms Hawkins, a shoe machinist, was jailed five times for her role leading the Suffragette campaign in Leicester in the early 20th Century. The £80,000 statue has been funded by a local businessman and will be revealed in the Market Square on 4 February. Peter Barrett, Ms Hawkins' great-grandson said it was a fitting tribute. ""The design fits the image of Alice ...standing in the Market Place, over 100 years ago, reaching out to hundreds and thousands of people,"" Mr Barrett said. ""It has been described as a dynamic pose."" The 7ft (2.1m) statue has been made out of bronze and will stand on a 4ft (1.2m) plinth. It is being unveiled in the centenary week of the passing of the 1918 Representation of the People Act, which first gave women the vote in Britain. Ms Hawkins left school in Stafford in 1876 to start work as a shoe machinist, later joining Equity Shoes, which encouraged workers to take part in political activism. From there she joined the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) and was one of 18 women to be jailed when they were charged by mounted police in Hyde Park in February 1907. After her time in prison, she organised meetings and protests in Leicester, inviting Sylvia Pankhurst and helping form the city's section of the WSPU. She died in 1946, aged 83, and was buried in an unmarked pauper's grave.  "
Hawkish,Sea wall to secure line 'for 100 years',2024-09-25,2019-05-31,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-48472901,"Work is beginning on a £30m scheme to protect a coastal railway line that washed into the sea five years ago. A new 25ft (7.5m) high sea wall is being built at Dawlish, Devon after the line collapsed during storms on 4 February 2014. The track which links Devon and Cornwall with the rest of the country was left dangling in the air after waves gouged out holes in the defences. Network Rail aims to ""secure the future of the line for the next 100 years"". Here is all you need to know about the Dawlish sea wall improvement scheme, from the Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS). Phase one starts on 1 June with site preparation work. Work on the concrete foundations starts on Monday and will last until 14 July when there will be a break until 9 September to avoid disruption during the summer. The scheduled finish date is 23 January 2020. To raise the height of the sea wall from 5m (16ft) to 7.5m. The walkway will also be raised and widened to 4m (13ft) from 3.1m (10ft), with a safety barrier. To protect the line from closure and to reduce flooding of the track by 90%. Network Rail points to forecasts of a sea level rise of 0.8m (3ft) in the next 100 years.  Western route managing director Mark Langman, said: ""world leading engineers"" had designed the plans to ""ensure the railway line is more resilient to extreme weather and rising sea levels for generations to come"". The main construction of the sea wall will begin. Pre-cast concrete panels will be installed, track drainage put in and existing promenade sections will be demolished with pre-cast concrete units installed. Surfacing work will take place on the promenade with lighting and seating. New concrete panels will clad the existing wall and this will be filled in with concrete. Ramps will connect the new raised promenade to the existing walkway levels at Colonnade underbridge and Boat Cove. Round the clock. Typically work will start five hours before and finish five hours after low tide. Work will be carried out six days a week, but these days will be selected to maximise spring tide working. For the duration of the work, there will be no car parking spaces available in Marine Parade, with the parking bays suspended. This will enable them to be used by construction staff to enable the delivery of vital materials. The parking suspension on Marine Parade will begin on 3 June. Where possible, ""as much access to the beach in front of Marine Parade will be retained for public use"" says Network Rail. During phase one, public access to Boat Cove will be maintained via the footbridge over the railway line, with a pedestrian walkway installed from the footbridge through Boat Cove to Coryton Cove."

Hawkish,News Daily: Stephen Hawking dies and Putin misses May's deadline,2024-09-25,2018-03-14,By Justin Parkinson,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-43393575,"Hello. Here's your morning briefing: The British physicist Stephen Hawking, world-renowned for his work on black holes and relativity, has died at the age of 76. For 54 years he lived with a rare form of motor neurone disease, which left him in a wheelchair and unable to speak except through a voice synthesiser. When first diagnosed, he was given only a few years to live. But Prof Hawking became famous beyond science, appearing in many TV shows and having his life story portrayed on film and TV. His book, A Brief History of Time, sold more than 10 million copies. His family paid tribute to ""an extraordinary man whose work and legacy will live on for many years"". Here is the story of Stephen Hawking's incredible life. Vladimir Putin has not responded to Theresa May's midnight deadline for an explanation over the poisoning of a former Russian spy and his daughter in Salisbury. So the focus now shifts on to what actions the prime minister is willing to take against the Russian president and his government. Moscow has promised that any ""punitive"" measures will ""meet with a response"". It denies being behind the use of a nerve agent against Sergei and Yulia Skripal, but Mrs May has said it's ""highly likely"" Russia was involved. Here's what we know so far. Sign up for a morning briefing direct to your phone Rex Tillerson, who's been sacked as US Secretary of State, has delivered a rebuke to Russia in his parting statement, accusing the country of ""troubling behaviour and actions"".

Hawkish,Rail worker jumped to avoid being hit by train,2024-09-25,2023-05-25,By Charlotte Cox,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-65707650,"A rail track worker jumped from the path of a train travelling at 55mph with just two seconds to spare. A Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) report said prompt use of the horn by the train driver had ""probably avoided a fatal accident"".  The track worker, who jumped into an adjacent line, was uninjured. Both the driver and worker were left ""shaken"" by the near miss near Teignmouth, Devon, the RAIB said.  In a safety report, it concluded ""informal communication"" between the worker and their engineering supervisor had led to ""assumptions"". The ""narrow miss"" near Teignmouth Station in the early hours of 14 February 2023 took place as the worker placed a sign with flashing lights on the track to indicate a work site.  The work was part of a project to build a rockfall shelter during which workers accessed the Great Western Main Line at Teignmouth Boatyard. After rounding a curve at about 55mph (88km/h), the driver spotted the worker and ""immediately sounded the train's warning horn"". The track worker ""jumped into the adjacent line which was also still open to traffic"". ""Less than two seconds later, the marker board was struck by the passing train"", the RAIB said.  The report said the incident occurred despite ""several conversations"" between the worker and his supervisor. But during tasks away from the operational railway, the worker was joined by their supervisor, leading to the assumption it was safe to start track work.  When the worker was later instructed to place the marker boards, the status of the track was not discussed, the RAIB said.  The worker headed to the Dawlish Warren end of the work site and, despite two subsequent phone calls with their supervisor, there was no further discussion on the status of the track. The report indicated the supervisor expected another call from the worker to confirm they could safely access the track, but the worker was ""mistakenly under the impression"" the track had been blocked to trains and did not call again. The report concluded ""informal communication"" between the track worker and supervisor arose due to ""their familiarity with each other, their good working relationship and because they had been applying the same work site arrangements almost every night for several months"".  The report referenced a similar incident in May 2019 in Bedfordshire. A Network Rail spokeswoman said: ""This was a serious incident where a railway worker could have been badly injured, or worse.  ""As a safety critical company, we work hard to prevent this type of incident from happening, but we recognise there is always room for improvement, and lessons will be learnt from this. ""We have already shared the outputs of an internal review, and will also be sharing the findings of the RAIB report with colleagues."" Follow BBC News South West on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

Hawkish,New £7.75m 'city-changing' museum opens,2024-09-25,2018-06-08,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-44300512,"A new £7.75m museum, due to open following a two-year restoration of an historic but underused building, has been described as a ""city-changing"" project. St Albans Museum and Gallery opens to the public later in the city's Grade II* listed Georgian town hall. Set over three floors, it tells the story of the city from the pre-Roman era through to modern times. The council said it had ""breathed new life into the building"". The town hall, built in 1831, which still houses the city's former courtroom and prison cells, has been largely redundant in recent years and was costing the authority about £100,000 a year to maintain. Meanwhile the old Museum of St Albans was attracting limited visitors due to its location on the edge of the town centre. In the restored building, displays tell the story of the district's development from 110,000 BC and feature Roman treasures and evidence of Boudicca's revolt. Visitors will also learn more about St Albans' role in War of the Roses and the city's famous figures such as Sir Francis Bacon, Ryder Cup founder and ex-mayor, Samuel Ryder, Prof Stephen Hawking, Stanley Kubrick and Jim Rodford. There is also space for exhibitions and contemporary art shows. The project received £2.8m from the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) and St Albans Council will provide £3.3m from the redevelopment of the former site for housing. The St Albans Museums and Galleries Trust raised £1.5m and is looking to raise a further £200,000. Councillor Annie Brewster said: ""This is a city-changing project. So many people, in fact over four million a year, walked past our Grade II* listed town hall and court house rarely giving a second thought to its grand past. ""We have created a new chapter, after over half a century of somewhat dormant purposes, we have breathed new life into the building and transformed it for new generations to enjoy."""

Sky Bet League Two top-scorer Andy Cook had scored twice in the second half to put the home side on course for a victory to keep alive their chances of making the top three. But Gillingham, who have won only two away games all season, hit back through Hawkins after eight added minutes. Former Bradford midfielder Timothee Dieng burst clear to fire the visitors ahead after 12 minutes. Dieng almost had a second when he nicked the ball off Alex Gilliead from a short goal-kick and shot just wide. But Gillingham threatened again as Alex MacDonald's inswinging corner was headed off the line by Richie Smallwood. Bradford levelled three minutes into the second half when Liam Ridehalgh's cross was headed home by Cook.

Georgia McManus was part of a select group who attended a sunrise listening party in Lowestoft, Suffolk, ahead of the release of But Here We Are. The album is the American rock band's first since their drummer Taylor Hawkins died aged 50 last year. Miss McManus described it as an outpouring ""of grief"".  She was among 80 or so people who gathered to listen to a recording of the album. The location was kept secret until the day before. The 28-year-old from Manchester, who is seeing the band for the 27th time in Germany this weekend, said she travelled from Manchester to London and then joined the rest of the party attendees to travel to Lowestoft on Thursday. She said none of them really knew what to expect but ""there was a lot of anticipation and excitement in the air to get to hear the new album early"".  They arrived at Ness Point at about 04:00 BST and got to hear the album 24 hours before it was released. ""We learnt that Lowestoft was chosen as the most eastern point of the country, following with the theme of a sunrise and horizon.  ""Even though it was a cloudy start to the day, the waves crashing as you're listening to these raw and emotional songs was a special moment,"" she said. As part of the event attendees were given lyric books for each song on the album and a limited edition postcard.  ""Travelling overnight was absolutely worth it,"" Miss McManus added. ""The album is a powerful, honest and emotional outpour of grief but includes some of their best songs yet."" Another fan who attended the event described it as ""emotional"" and said ""how Dave (Grohl) and the band put this together with everything that's happened is unbelievable"". Foo Fighters UK, a fan hub, said several sunrise listening parties happened around the world, from New Zealand across to Los Angeles. It said it was orchestrated by the record label on request of the band's lead singer, Dave Grohl, to ""signify the rise of a new day for the band"".

Hawkish,Oscars land trio of female comic stars to host,2024-09-25,2022-02-15,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-60385968,"This year's Oscars will be hosted by US comic actresses Regina Hall, Amy Schumer and Wanda Sykes, the Academy announced on Tuesday. The trio of film star funny women will emcee the 94th Academy Awards at Hollywood's Dolby Theatre on 27 March. For the past three years, the ceremony has had no official overall host. ""We want people to get ready to have a good time. It's been a while,"" said Hall, Schumer and Sykes in a statement published on the Oscars website. Appearing on Good Morning America just after the announcement, Primetime Emmy-winning comedian Schumer joked: ""I'm not sure who thought this was a good idea but I am hosting the Oscars, along with my good friend Wanda Sykes and Regina Hall. ""I better go watch some movies."" It has been 35 years since three presenters have shared hosting duties - Chevy Chase, Goldie Hawn and Paul Hogan combined forces in 1987 - and this year will mark the first time three women will have done so. Next month's ceremony will also include a new ""fan favourite"" prize for the year's most popular film, as voted for by the public via Twitter and the web. The move, announced on Monday, comes as organisers try to lure viewers back to the awards show. Producer Will Packer has been tasked with breathing fresh life into the annual event, that has seen audiences dwindle in recent years. The new award will give fresh hope to films like Spider-Man: No Way Home and No Time To Die, which both failed to earn Oscar nominations last week for best picture although they were recognised in several other categories including best visual effects. The original idea to honour the most popular films was put on hold back in 2019. Now it's been resurrected but the fan vote won't come with its own Oscar; it will be a separate standalone prize. People based in the US will be able to vote from now until 3 March via the official website for an #OscarsFanFavorite, as well as for an #OscarsCheerMoment - another new award for ""the most cheer-worthy movie ever"". Those outside the US will be able to tweet their choices. American TV host Jimmy Kimmel was the last ceremony host back in 2018. US comedian and actor Kevin Hart stepped down from hosting the 2019 Oscars following a controversy over homophobic tweets. Since then, the show has just featured various awards presenters with no overall host. ""This year's show is all about uniting movie lovers,"" said Packer. ""It's apropos that we've lined up three of the most dynamic, hilarious women with very different comedic styles.   ""I know the fun Regina, Amy and Wanda will be having will translate to our audience as well. Many surprises in store! Expect the unexpected!"" Wanda Sykes is the creator and star of Netflix's The Upshaws, and has also appeared on TV shows such as The New Adventures of Old Christine, Black-ish and Curb Your Enthusiasm. On the long-running latter show, Sykes plays a version of herself and often runs into trouble with Larry David, while acting as a loyal friend of the protagonist's ex-wife, Cheryl. In 1999 she won a Primetime Emmy for outstanding writing for a variety, music or comedy special for her work on The Chris Rock Show. In May 2009, she was the entertainer for the annual White House Correspondents' Association dinner, becoming both the first African American woman and the first openly LGBT person to do so. Her movie credits include Down to Earth, Rio, and Bad Moms. She also voiced the role of Granny in Ice Age: Continental Drift in 2012 and returned to the role in 2016's Ice Age: Collision Course. Amy Schumer is a US stand-up comedian and actor, who broke through on the NBC reality competition series Last Comic Standing in 2007. From 2013 to 2016, she starred in her own Comedy Central sketch show, Inside Amy Schumer, for which she won a Primetime Emmy Award. She made her big screen film debut in the 2015 movie Trainwreck, which she also wrote, receiving a Golden Globe nomination. She also hosted the MTV Movie Awards the same year. Her 2016 written memoir, The Girl with the Lower Back Tattoo, was a best-seller; and the same year she won several Grammy Awards, including best comedy album for Amy Schumer: Live at the Apollo.  In 2018, she starred in the comedy film I Feel Pretty, and also scored a Tony Award nomination for best actress in a play for her Broadway debut in Meteor Shower. This year, as well as hosting the Oscars, Schumer - who recently appeared in Stephen Karam's big screen adaptation of The Humans - will star in the Hulu series Life & Beth. Regina Hall is perhaps best-known for her role as Brenda Meeks in the Scary Movie series from 2000 to 2006, and other films such as The Best Man, Little and The Hate U Give. She also starred in Girls Trip, which Packer produced, in 2017. The female-driven comedy, also starring Jada Pinkett Smith, Queen Latifah and Tiffany Haddish, went on to be a big box office hit Hall's performance in the indie film Support the Girls, the following year, saw her become the first black woman to win the New York Film Critics Circle Award for best actress. Last month, two of her new films, Master, and Honk for Jesus, Save Your Soul, were featured at the Sundance Film Festival. Her recent TV credits include Hulu's Nine Perfect Strangers and Black Monday on Showtime. She also has award hosting experience, after taking the helm at 2019's BET awards."

Hawkish,Storm Callum overwhelms flood defences,2024-09-25,2018-10-12,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-45835824,"About 2,000 homes and businesses have lost power and some flood defences have failed as Storm Callum batters the UK. Some coastal flood defences in Exmouth, Devon, have been breached and a yellow weather warning is in place for the west coast and north-east of England, parts of Wales and Northern Ireland. Wind speeds recorded in the Scilly Isles hit 76mph and 64mph at RNAS Culdrose in Cornwall. In Northern Ireland, power has been lost to 500 properties. The weather has caused the cancellation of a number of flights in Exeter, Bristol, Belfast City, the Isle of Man and Cardiff.  Western Power Distribution said about 1,080 properties were without electricity in Cornwall, while Electricity North West said 419 customers in Cumbria and Lancashire were affected. Rail passengers travelling to and from south-west England faced cancellations and delays of more than two and a half hours after power cables fell on to the track between Totnes and Plymouth.  The line has since re-opened but Cross Country Trains has cancelled all further services through the area. A spokesperson for Great Western Railway said that it was still operating and every effort would be made to get people home. A coach full of children had a narrow escape when a tree fell into the path of their school bus near St Agnes in Cornwall.  The driver, Alan Nielson, said it came down 10-15 seconds before they pulled on to the road. Several vehicles have been damaged by falling trees in the Biddulph area of Staffordshire. Trees have also blocked roads near Audley in Staffordshire and Nantwich in Cheshire, police said. Cormac, an engineering and construction contractor for Cornwall Council, said it had dealt with reports of 30 fallen trees and about 25 flooding cases in the past 12 hours.   The emergency services and authorities have urged people to avoid taking unnecessary risks after a man was spotted swimming with seals in Dawlish, Devon. Another swimmer, Ross Edgley, who is attempting to complete a 2,000 mile swim around Britain, is floating on a boat in Grimsby, Lincolnshire, waiting for the North Sea to calm down enough for him to continue. The 32-year-old is not allowed to step foot on land under the rules of the challenge. The Environment Agency submitted plans earlier this month to improve the flood defences in Exmouth.

Hawkish,US 'still hopeful' about N Korea summit,2024-09-25,2018-05-16,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-44144145,"The Trump administration is hopeful its summit with North Korea will go ahead, despite threats of cancellation. A White House spokesperson said the US president remained ready.   Hours earlier, North Korea released an angry statement saying it might pull out of the meeting if the US insisted it gave up its nuclear weapons unilaterally. The highly anticipated meeting between Mr Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong-un is due to take place on 12 June. ""The president is ready if the meeting takes place,"" said White House spokesperson Sarah Sanders. ""If it doesn't, we'll continue the maximum pressure campaign that's been ongoing."" When asked if it would go ahead, Mr Trump later said: ""We'll have to see"".  He reiterated that the US would still insist on denuclearisation. The groundbreaking agreement for Mr Kim and Mr Trump to meet came about as North Korea said it was committed to denuclearising the Korean peninsula.  Exactly what that would entail has remained unclear but North Korea has invited foreign media to witness the dismantling of its main nuclear test site later this month. North Korea's statement, carried by state media, said the country had had high expectations from the summit, but it was ""totally disappointed"" by recent reckless remarks from the US.  It pointed the finger squarely at US National Security Adviser John Bolton. ""We do not hide our feeling of repugnance towards him,"" said the statement, which was written by Vice-Foreign Minister Kim Kye-gwan. In a television interview at the weekend, Mr Bolton said North Korea could follow a ""Libya model"" of verifiable denuclearisation, but this alarms Pyongyang, which watched Libya's Colonel Gaddafi give up his nuclear programme only for him to be killed by Western-backed rebels a few years later. After the North Korean outburst, Mr Bolton told Fox News Radio that the odds are still in favour of the meeting going ahead.  ""We are trying to be both optimistic and realistic at the same time,"" he said.  By Laura Bicker, BBC News, Seoul  The whole reason the North Korean state has spent years building up a nuclear arsenal, at such a great cost, is for survival.  So to compare denuclearisation in North Korea with Libya or indeed Iraq as John Bolton did on Sunday is not going to offer much comfort. Both regimes collapsed.  This is also a warning shot to the Trump administration. They will be aware how much Mr Trump wants this summit and how it is being spun as a success brought about by his maximum pressure strategy.  There were signs this boasting irritated Pyongyang, but now it has decided to speak out through someone in a position of power.   North Korea wants the world to know that it is coming to the negotiating table from a position of strength, and they may feel that they are making all the concessions.  They've suspended all missile tests, released the three US detainees, Kim Jong-un met President Moon and the pair signed a declaration, and they're about to dismantle a nuclear test site in front of international media.  So to hear the Trump administration claiming credit for a deal they don't like has been a step too far.  These statements more than hint that North Korea is prepared to walk away from President Trump's summit in Singapore until it does hear a deal it does like. Kim Kye-gwan said:  ""If the US is trying to drive us into a corner to force our unilateral nuclear abandonment, we will no longer be interested in such dialogue."" The vice-foreign minister is known to be highly respected in the North Korean leadership and has taken part in negotiations with the US before. There is very little chance his comments were not personally endorsed by Kim Jong-un. Hours before the announcement, in a sign of growing problems, North Korea had also pulled out of a meeting scheduled with South Korea on Wednesday because of anger over the start of US-South Korea joint military drills.  A Chinese government spokesman urged North Korea and the US to ""meet each other halfway"" ahead of negotiations.  The hawkish conservative is a firm defender of US power and a confrontational advocate for wielding that strength abroad. He has previously said it would be ""perfectly legitimate"" to carry out a pre-emptive strike on North Korea.   In media interviews over the weekend, he said North Korea could follow a Libyan model of nuclear disarmament - Libya gave up its weapons' programmes in the early 2000s and only then secured economic aid and normalised relations with the US. However during the 2011 uprising against Colonel Gaddafi's regime, Western powers intervened in Libya in favour of the rebels, and Gaddafi was captured and killed."
Hawkish,China media calls on British Museum to return artefacts,2024-09-25,2023-08-28,By Fan Wang,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-66636705,"A call for the British Museum to return Chinese artefacts after the recent alleged theft of about 2,000 items is heating up social media in the country. The demand became the most trending topic on Weibo after an editorial in a state-run nationalist newspaper. In the piece published on Sunday night, Global Times asked the museum to give back all Chinese cultural relics ""free of charge"". The Chinese government has not commented on the issue yet. The BBC has reached out to the British Museum for comment but is yet to hear back. The museum has been under pressure after around 2,000 items were reported ""missing, stolen or damaged"" two weeks ago. A member of staff was sacked when the news first came out. Last week, its director Hartwig Fischer also announced he would step down. In its article, Global Times argued that the world-renowned museum has failed to take good care of ""cultural property belonging to other countries"". ""The huge loopholes in the management and security of cultural objects in the British Museum exposed by this scandal have led to the collapse of a long-standing and widely circulated claim that 'foreign cultural objects are better protected in the British Museum',"" the editorial reads. The British Museum has the biggest collection of Chinese antiquities in the West. According to its website, it has about 23,000 Chinese objects, spanning from the Neolithic age to the present. These include a large range of precious items such as paintings, prints, jade, bronzes and ceramics. One of the most famous is the reproduction of a scroll called ""Admonitions of the Instructress to the Court Ladies"", a masterpiece considered a milestone in Chinese art history.  This is not the first time Chinese netizens have called on the British Museum to return artefacts in recent years amid a rise in nationalist sentiment. But the editorial on the suspected thefts has sparked more conversation this time around. The hashtag  ""The British Museum please return Chinese antiquities"" topped Weibo's search chart until noon local time on Monday. It has been viewed more than half a billion times. ""Return the objects to their original owner,"" a comment liked by more than 32,000 times reads. ""Now that the country is rich and the people are strong, it's time to have our treasures back home,"" another top comment says. While tens of thousands support Global Times' request, some others were not as impressed. ""Why don't you make a trip to the UK for our treasures? Just shouting on Weibo domestically is just playing safe and shameless,"" a post liked by more than 10,000 times says.  The Global Times, known for its hawkish views, has led the charge in publishing English-language editorials attacking the West, particularly in recent years amid China's deteriorating relationship with the West.  It is not clear whether the Chinese government will take any action following the calls. But asking the museum to return artefacts is a sentiment not limited to China.  Following reports that artefacts had been stolen, other countries have also said the British Museum can no longer be trusted with their antiquities. The Greek government, which has been asking for the return of the Parthenon Sculptures, also known as the Elgin Marbles, renewed those calls this week. Greece's Minister of Culture, Lina Mendoni was quoted as saying that the security questions raised by the missing objects ""reinforces the permanent and just demand of our country for the definitive return"" of the Elgin marbles. Nigerian officials have also called on the museum to return the Benin Bronzes taken from the Benin kingdom that now lies within its territory.  Tim Loughton MP, the Conservative chairman of the all party parliamentary group for the museum, has called such demands ""opportunistic"". He told the BBC that other countries should be ""rallying around to help retrieve objects instead of trying to take advantage""."
Hawkish,Hawking's warnings: What he predicted about the future,2024-09-25,2018-03-15,By Paul Rincon,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-43408961,"Stephen Hawking's fame was founded on the research he did on general relativity and black holes. But he often stepped outside his own field of research, using his recognition to highlight what he saw as the great challenges and existential threats for humanity in coming decades. His pronouncements drove headlines in the media, which sometimes proved controversial.  Hawking was clearly troubled that we were putting all our eggs in one basket - that basket being Earth. For decades, Hawking had been calling for humans to begin the process of permanently settling other planets. It made news headlines again and again. Hawking's rationale was that humankind would eventually fall victim to an extinction-level catastrophe - perhaps sooner rather than later. What worried him were so-called low-probability, high impact events - a large asteroid striking our planet is the classic example.  But Hawking perceived a host of other potential threats: artificial intelligence, climate change, GM viruses and nuclear war to name a few. In 2016, he told the BBC: ""Although the chance of a disaster to planet Earth in a given year may be quite low, it adds up over time, and becomes a near certainty in the next thousand or 10,000 years. He was confident that humans would spread out into the cosmos by that time (given the chance), but added: ""We will not establish self-sustaining colonies in space for at least the next hundred years, so we have to be very careful in this period."" Here, Hawking's views dovetailed with those of entrepreneur Elon Musk, another science superstar whose cogitations attract widespread attention. In 2013, Musk told a conference: ""Either we spread Earth to other planets, or we risk going extinct. An extinction event is inevitable and we're increasingly doing ourselves in."" In line with his thoughts on the matter, Hawking also attached his name to a project researching technologies for interstellar travel - the Breakthrough Starshot initiative.  Hawking recognised the great opportunities that arose from advances in artificial intelligence, but also warned about the dangers.  In 2014, he told the BBC that ""the development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race"". Hawking said the primitive forms of artificial intelligence developed so far had already proved very useful; indeed, the tech he used to communicate incorporated a basic form of AI. But Hawking feared the consequences of advanced forms of machine intelligence that could match or surpass humans. Some academics thought the comments drew on outdated science fiction tropes. Others, such as Prof Bradley Love, from UCL, agreed there were risks: ""Clever AI will create tremendous wealth for society, but will leave many people without jobs,"" he told The Conversation. But he added: ""If we are going to worry about the future of humanity we should focus on the real challenges, such as climate change and weapons of mass destruction rather than fanciful killer AI robots.""  The Cambridge physicist regarded global warming as one of the biggest threats to life on the planet. Hawking was particularly fearful of a so-called tipping point, where global warming would become irreversible. He also expressed concern about America's decision to pull out of the Paris Agreement. ""We are close to the tipping point where global warming becomes irreversible. Trump's action could push the Earth over the brink, to become like Venus, with a temperature of 250 degrees, and raining sulphuric acid,"" he told BBC News. The UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) also highlights the potential risk of hitting climate tipping points as temperatures increase - though it also emphasises the gaps in our knowledge. However, Hawking was in plentiful company in regarding global warming as one of the great challenges of centuries to come. There's a whole field of science, known as Seti (The Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence) dedicated to listening for signals from intelligent beings elsewhere in the Universe. But Hawking cautioned against trying to actively hail any alien civilisations that might be out there. In 2010, he told the Discovery Channel that aliens might simply raid Earth for resources and then move on. ""If aliens visit us, the outcome would be much as when Columbus landed in America, which didn't turn out well for the Native Americans,"" he said. ""We only have to look at ourselves to see how intelligent life might develop into something we wouldn't want to meet."" At the time, Seth Shostak, from the Seti Institute in California, told the Guardian: ""This is an unwarranted fear. If they're interested in resources, they have ways of finding rocky planets that don't depend on whether we broadcast or not. They could have found us a billion years ago."" But others saw the logic in Hawking's comments. Ian Stewart, a mathematician at Warwick University, commented: ""Lots of people think that because they would be so wise and knowledgeable, they would be peaceful. I don't think you can assume that."" The media attention gave him an unprecedented platform. But some in the scientific community were occasionally less enthusiastic about the resulting headlines than the journalists who wrote them.  Indeed, I've been asked in the past why the British media seemed to hang on Hawking's every word. Prof Sir Martin Rees, the Astronomer Royal, said: ""He had robust common sense, and was ready to express forceful political opinions.  ""However, a downside of his iconic status was that that his comments attracted exaggerated attention even on topics where he had no special expertise - for instance philosophy, or the dangers from aliens or from intelligent machines."" But many would also argue that, beyond individual statements or headlines, Hawking had a unique ability to connect with the public.  They would say that the ""hype"" this sometimes generated was an inevitable by-product of his household name status. Instead, we should focus on a greater good - his ability to bring science to the attention of people who might otherwise never have given it a second thought. It's testament to his success as a communicator that the mourning for this champion of rational thinking extends far beyond the scientific community. Follow Paul on Twitter."
Hawkish,N Korea missile launches were 'nuclear attack drills',2024-09-25,2022-10-10,By Frances Mao,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-63196618,"North Korea says its recent barrage of missile launches were a ""simulation"" of a nuclear attack on the South. It comes as intelligence suggests North Korea is preparing to hold its first nuclear weapon test in five years. In recent weeks, Pyongyang has launched seven sets of missiles in response to recent US and South Korea drills. On Monday, state media published extensive reports claiming the missiles were designed to carry tactical nuclear weapons. These are small short-range weapons intended for use on the battlefield. They said the military practised loading the missiles with dummy versions of these miniaturised warheads.  They also claimed to have successfully simulated hitting South Korea's military bases, ports and airports, and said the launches were a warning to US and South Korea. State news agency KNCA ran photos of leader Kim Jong-un overseeing and ""guiding"" the tests.  South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol said North Korea has nothing to gain from using nuclear weapons.  ""North Korea is advancing its nuclear development and threatening not only the Republic of Korea but the world,"" he said, referring to South Korea by its official name.  ""I believe it has nothing to gain from nuclear weapons.""  US and South Korea intelligence officials have been suggesting that the North may soon test a nuclear weapon for the first time since 2017. Experts believe it could also use the opportunity to detonate a smaller tactical device for the first time - the sort which would fit into the missiles it has been testing. Last month  Kim Jong-un declared North Korea an ""irreversible"" nuclear power and revised its laws, allowing it to use nuclear weapons pre-emptively. Its previous policy had been to only use such weapons in response to an attack. It has also markedly stepped up its frequency of missile firings this year, carrying out over 40 missile launches this year so far - its most ever. Most of the launches in the past fortnight have been short-range missiles, which landed in the sea between North Korea and Japan. But North Korea also fired a longer-distance missile over Japan last Tuesday - which analysts say is a new intermediate-range ballistic missile, based on the weapon's design. This year has seen the North test-fire missiles from a variety of launch sites including trains and convoys - moving platforms which would make it harder for the weapons to be destroyed in a strike, analysts have suggested. They also noted that Monday's state media reports framed the recent launches as ""tactical nuclear operations units"" - instead of describing them purely as missile tests - suggesting that North Korea has now developed a system for deploying smaller, short-range nuclear weapons. The 25 September-October 9 barrage were a response to the US deploying its nuclear-powered aircraft carrier the USS Ronald Reagan to waters around the Korean peninsula, and holding joint drills with Seoul and Tokyo. The acceleration marks a significant change from when Pyongyang pursued denuclearisation talks with then US President Donald Trump between 2018 and 2019. Analysts say North Korea is also reacting in response to South Korea's President Yoon Suk-yeol, who was elected in May and has pursued a more hawkish stance to the North and closer ties with the US."

Lifeguards said choppy water and strong currents, combined with the increase in visitors in the warm weather, were factors in the spate of rescues on Tuesday. Four rescues took place at Dawlish Warren, two in Exmouth and one in Teignmouth. Jake Butt, from the RNLI, urged beachgoers to ""respect the conditions"". He said: ""The south coast is typically quite calm and sheltered, however we have been experiencing stronger currents than usual due to strong easterly winds, and as a result, this poses more danger to those who enter the water. ""We urge everyone to respect the conditions, follow the lifeguard advice and be well prepared for any activity you have planned in the sea."" The RNLI said at Dawlish Warren two girls were dragged out around the rocks in front of the lifeguard unit at about 11:00 BST. It said they were pulled from the rocks and given minor first aid. Lifeguards responded again at 15:00 to two other girls who were pulled out to sea by a large set of waves towards the groyne at Dawlish. The service said they managed to hold onto the groyne while a lifeguard swam out with a rescue tube. Both girls were treated for cuts and bruises. On Teignmouth beach, the RNLI said a lifeboat crew rescued a girl that had slipped from the beach ramp and fell into the water at about 16:00. She received care from lifeguards and the lifeboat crew on the beach. At Exmouth, a girl fell into deep water off the outflow pipe, with another girl finding herself in difficulty while attempting to save her friend. Both were safely rescued.  Rip currents are strong, narrow channels that can pull swimmers and surfers away from the shore.

Hawkish,'Why I translate all of Trump's tweets into Chinese',2024-09-25,2019-08-08,By Zhaoyin Feng,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-49092612,"US President Donald Trump's trade war has enraged the Chinese government but it has also attracted some support among the Chinese people. A Twitter account run by Chinese immigrants in the US translates all his tweets for more than 100,000 followers - many of whom see Trump as a human rights advocate. For at least four hours each day, Jeff Ding, 45, pays close attention to the Twitter account of @realDonaldTrump With every new tweet, Ding rapidly translates the president's words into Chinese for @Trump_Chinese. The freelance engineering consultant in Los Angeles who hails from the same Central China province as Chairman Mao Zedong, is one of the three volunteers running @Trump_Chinese.  They are all Trump supporters that are critical of the Chinese government and hope to ""spread Trump's messages in the Chinese-speaking world"", says Ding. The account, which translates as ""Trump's Chinese synchronous tweets"" in English, notes its mission is to help followers ""understand the theories of governance through Trump's tweets"".  It launched in September 2018 and has more than 100,000 followers, although the only account it follows is, of course, @realDonaldTrump. ""We aim to service Chinese people around the globe, especially mainland Chinese who use VPNs to climb over the Great Firewall,"" says Ding. He translates the tweets into Simplified Chinese, which is used on the mainland. Traditional Chinese is used in Hong Kong and Taiwan. China blocks selected foreign websites, including Twitter, and the invisible boundary between the domestic and global internet is commonly known as the Great Firewall. Some mainlanders use VPNs - virtual private networks which mask your computers location - to access Twitter, but it can be hard to estimate how many users exist. Ding says his main motivation to maintain @Trump_Chinese is a strong belief that Trump is the most supportive president in American history for China's human rights.  He believes Trump's trade war applies pressure on China's economy, which will drag China into an economic recession. That downturn will challenge the Communist Chinese Party's (CCP) legitimacy and lead to its downfall.  When Ding encounters tweets that are tricky to translate, he consults Tang Baiqiao, a 51-year-old California-based Chinese political dissident who first came up with the idea of setting up @Trump_Chinese. Tang was a student activist during the 1989 Tiananmen Uprising and came to the US as a political asylum seeker in 1992.  In recent years, he has become one of the most fervent Trump supporters in the overseas Chinese dissident community. Additionally, Tang has a friend in the White House - he wrote the foreword to Death by China, a book written by trade adviser Peter Navarro, who is considered the main architect of Trump's China trade policy.  Trump's trade war on China brings ""obvious"" benefits to China's human rights, says Tang. The far-reaching economic sanctions aim to remove China's service trade barriers, like the country's bans on Gmail, Twitter and Facebook. In Tang's opinion, this also means no more internet censorship and publishing restrictions.  Since the beginning of his campaign, Trump has used ""China"" as a trigger to rally supporters.  ""We can't continue to allow China to rape our country, and that's what they're doing,"" Trump repeatedly said on the campaign trail, his words often met with raucous cheers of agreement. And as president, his trade war has shown little sign of stopping. Trump's hawkish China trade policy has contributed to tensions between Washington and Beijing, while simultaneously attracting the support of people angry with the Chinese government. @Trump_Chinese has become an outlet for the dissidents and dissatisfied. Every time Trump criticises China on Twitter, the account gets a particularly large number of comments and gains thousands of followers. In May, Trump unleashed a series of tweets, announcing a plan to impose 25% tariffs on $325bn (£267bn) worth of Chinese goods. Chinese-speaking Twitter users passionately applauded his decision by commenting under @Trump_Chinese's related posts. ""Excellent job! Please be more forceful!"" ""Wise and correct decision!""  One described his move as ""a God-given opportunity"" for overthrowing the Chinese government. Another wished Trump good health and re-election. A month later, the trade talks took a turn for the better. Trump tweeted that he had ""a very good talk"" with President Xi Jinping and would not increase the tariffs. @Trump_Chinese was immediately filled with disappointment and outrage.  ""I thought you were one of the greatest American presidents... It turns out that you may be just a businessman without moral principles,"" one commented. Some called him a ""hypocrite"". Even though Trump is often fuming about China on trade, he has repeatedly praised Xi as ""the most powerful [Chinese] leader in a hundred years"" and his ""good friend"". Tang is not at all put off by these compliments, which he sees as Trump's diplomatic rhetoric and negotiation skills. ""Slap you in the face, and then gently stroke it,"" he says. However, not all Chinese dissidents see Trump as a fighter for human rights.  ""Trump started the trade war not aiming to promote freedom and democracy in China,"" says Teng Biao, a New York-based exiled human rights lawyer. ""Objectively speaking, Trump's hawkish trade policy has given Beijing a hard time. However, fundamentally, he has no interests in improving China's human rights.""  Before he fled to the US in 2014, the 46-year-old was once a lawyer and law professor in China. Teng is concerned that placing hope on the ""morally-defected"" president is a mistake, and that viewing the enemy's enemy as a friend will soon be proven to be ""naïve.""  Although senior officials in his administration have condemned China's human rights conditions, Trump himself rarely speaks specifically on the issues.  He has offered no words about the Muslim camps in the Chinese region of Xinjiang and has not taken a stand regarding the Hong Kong anti-extradition bill protests.  On 22 July, Trump said he was ""not involved in it very much,"" and said the Chinese president had acted ""very responsibly"". On 1 August, he said it's up for China to deal with the Hong Kong ""riots"". Fluent in both English and Chinese, Teng enjoys a large following on Twitter, but he thinks among outspoken Chinese dissidents, he and those who are anti-Trump are in a minority. But there's one thing that almost all of them agree on - when interpreting Trump's views on China, lines should be drawn between China the country, its people and the Communist government.  On @Trump_Chinese, ""China"" is often translated as ""the Chinese Communist Party"", especially in tweets where Trump is aggressively targeting Beijing. This reflects the dissidents' political thinking. ""We're sons and daughters of China, not of Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin,"" says Ding, calling it his guiding principle. Ironically, when translated into Chinese, Trump's tweets have striking similarities with the CCP's propaganda rhetoric.  ""Change 'socialism or communism' to 'western capitalism', swap 'America' with 'China', then it's basically what you hear from Chinese propaganda,"" one commented on @Trump_Chinese, referring to Trump's tweets criticising communism and promoting American patriotism.  Trump often uses ""great"" to describe the country and people involved with the administration. So does the CCP. The Trump administration's distrust in China has left some worried that a new wave of ""Red Scare"" is approaching. Ding says he has not personally felt Sinophobia on the rise in the US. Even if there's growing anti-Chinese sentiment, ""Beijing is to be blamed,"" he said, adding: ""Trump is only taking countermeasures."" Ding is likely to become a naturalised American citizen soon. He says, if he can cast a vote in 2020, he has found a fighter for his cause."
Hawkish,Chinese media take aim at US 'virus lab' theory,2024-09-25,2020-05-05,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-52540737,"Chinese state media has accused US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo of lying, after he said there was ""enormous evidence"" the coronavirus emanated from a laboratory in Wuhan. Mr Pompeo made the claim on Sunday, without going into specifics. In an editorial on Tuesday, the hawkish Global Times newspaper said Mr Pompeo was ""degenerate"". The World Health Organization says the US claims are ""speculative"", and that it has seen no ""specific evidence"". Editorials in Chinese state media often given an insight into the direction of government thinking, but there has been no official response to Mr Pompeo's comments as yet.  On Monday, the Global Times accused Mr Pompeo of ""absurd theories and twisted facts"", and on Tuesday the attack continued. ""Pompeo aims to kill two birds with one stone by spewing falsehoods,"" it said. ""First, he hopes to help Trump win re-election this November...second, Pompeo hates socialist China and, in particular, cannot accept China's rise."" The editorial admitted there were ""initial problems"" in China's response to the outbreak, but claimed ""the overall performance is bright enough to outweigh the flaws"". It also said it was ""conceivable that the virus first contacted humans in other places [than Wuhan]"". The Global Times is not the only Chinese outlet to take aim at Mr Pompeo and the US. The People's Daily said Mr Pompeo had ""no evidence"", while a piece on the CCTV site accused US politicians of ""nefarious plotting"". In an interview with ABC on Sunday, Mr Pompeo said there was ""enormous evidence"" that the virus had emerged from the Wuhan Institute of Virology. ""Remember, China has a history of infecting the world, and they have a history of running sub-standard laboratories,"" he said. Mr Pompeo - a former director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) - said he did not think the virus was man-made or genetically modified. The Wuhan laboratory is known to study coronaviruses in bats. In April, President Trump was asked whether ""lax safety protocols"" allowed such a virus to escape via an intern and her boyfriend. Mr Trump did not confirm the theory, but said: ""More and more we're hearing the story."" Last week, he was asked if he had seen evidence that gave him a ""high degree of confidence"" that the virus emerged in the Wuhan laboratory. ""Yes I have,"" he replied - but said he could not go into specifics. Last month, the Washington Post reported that US officials visited the laboratory in January 2018, and reported back their safety concerns. On Monday, World Health Organization emergencies director Michael Ryan said it had received ""no data or specific evidence"" from the US about the virus origins. ""So from our perspective, this remains speculative,"" he said. Last week, the US intelligence community said it ""concurred"" that the virus ""was not man-made or genetically modified"". But it said it would ""continue to examine"" whether the outbreak began via ""contract with infected animals, or if it was the result of an an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan"". Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Tuesday that the most likely source of the virus was a wildlife market. However he said he would not rule out the theory that it originated in a lab.  ""What's really important is that we have a proper review, an independent review which looks into the sources of these things in a transparent way so we can learn the lessons,"" he told reporters.  Meanwhile, Western ""intelligence sources"" have told several news outlets there is ""no evidence"" to suggest the virus leaked from a laboratory."

However, friends described her as a ""free spirit"" who was ""interested in fun rather than commitment"". The court heard how the immediate trigger for his attack was an argument about Miss Mellor borrowing a lighter from Rose's father's house when they visited him at Christmas. Rose claimed Miss Mellor was in a rage and ""flew at him with a crash helmet"". He said he held her by the throat to defend himself and had not intended to kill her. However, the court heard how he had previously tried to strangle a former girlfriend and a nurse at Langdon Hospital in Dawlish. Despite Rose's previous mental health issues after a head injury nearly 20 years ago, Judge Paul Darlow said Rose's ""frailties"" had ""nothing to do with it"".  He told Rose: ""The attack was in her own home - you strangled her with your bare hands. ""The attack must have been up close and personal - she was no more than an arm's length away from your face as you watched her struggle for breath and die."" ""You initially attempted to lie your way out of it and thereafter to blame her. That also demonstrates your callousness,"" he said."
Hawkish,Stephen Hawking remembered online,2024-09-25,2018-03-14,By George Pierpoint,https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-43397847,"Millions of people across the globe have flooded social media with tributes and illustrations expressing their sadness at the death of the renowned physicist Professor Stephen Hawking. Many artworks posted in honour of the professor focus on his iconic mobility chair. One such image which has been widely shared depicts the famous chair with an array of glowing stars emanating from the seat.  The picture was originally posted by news website Pictoline with the caption, ""Goodbye, Stephen Hawking"".  A minimalist portrayal of the professor's chair was posted on Instagram by Barcelona-based designer Eh'ctor.  Venezuelan designer, Oriana Estefania posted an image of Professor Hawking flying towards a black hole with the caption, ""Free, heading to your paradise... the universe"". The official Twitter account of the Clangers also shared an image of the children's TV characters looking up at the stars along with one of Professor Hawking's widely shared quotes.  Alana Neimanis in London, posted a video of her eight-year-old son Samuel reacting to the news of Professor Hawking's death.  In the video, he explains that he will ""forever miss"" the professor, and thanks him for his contribution to science.  Alana told BBC News that Professor Hawking inspired her son to develop a real love for physics.  ""Samuel often plays in the kitchen filling the sink with water and washing up to let the foam drain to see how it emulates the force of a black hole."" Samuel has Autism Spectrum Disorder, and sometimes finds it hard to understand why his friends are not as interested he is in the laws of physics.  Alana also reflected that Samuel has been inspired by the way Professor Hawking overcame the barriers of his disability to lead a ""very successful"" life.  Twitter account, Curious_Squirrel, which regularly shares light-hearted content about squirrels, posted an illustration depicting a squirrel observing the universe.  The tweet reads that Professor Hawking was such a skilled scientific communicator, he could teach ""even a squirrel"" about the universe.  Many online have been discussing the significance of the date of Professor Hawking's death, using the hashtag #PiDay. The date, 14 March, is marked as 'Pi Day' by some on social media in reference to the first three digits of the date, 3.14 - when written in the US-style - mirroring the first three digits of the mathematical constant pi.  Astrophysicist John Moffitt commented on the aptness of Professor Hawking's date of death, and pointed out that the date is also the birthday of Albert Einstein. "

Hawkish,Israeli PM in first UAE trip as Iran threat looms,2024-09-25,2021-12-13,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-59636279,"Naftali Bennett has become the first Israeli leader to visit the United Arab Emirates, as he attempts to deepen ties at a time of rising tensions over Iran. Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed, the UAE's de facto leader, held talks with Mr Bennett a year after their countries normalised relations. Israel's prime minister said he wanted to boost economic and commercial ties.  He was also expected to urge the UAE to take a tougher stance in response to Iran's expanding nuclear programme. The UAE shares Israel's concerns about the potential threat from a nuclear-armed Iran, but it is also trying to establish better relations with Tehran. The UAE became only the third Arab state to fully recognise Israel last year as part of the so-called Abraham Accords brokered by the US.  The countries have since swapped ambassadors and agreed trade deals worth hundreds of millions of dollars, including agreements on defence and arms development. Mr Bennett was welcomed by the UAE's foreign minister and an honour guard when he arrived in Abu Dhabi on Sunday night. On Monday, he was photographed shaking hands with Sheikh Mohammed before a meeting that the Israeli prime minister's office described as ""historic"". Sheikh Mohammed expressed hope that the visit would ""advance the relationship of co-operation towards more positive steps in the interests of the people of the two nations and of the region"", the official Wam news agency reported. Before departing Israel, Mr Bennett said that he was ""going to discuss ways to further our co-operation in a number of fields, especially strengthening our economic and commercial ties"". But Israel's Haaretz newspaper reported that Mr Bennett had told meetings that his focus would be Iran, and that there was concern in Israel about recent contacts between Emirati and Iranian officials. Last week, the UAE's national security advisor, Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed, a brother of Sheikh Mohammed, met Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi during a visit to Tehran. Sheikh Tahnoon said he hoped the trip would be a ""turning point"" for relations between the countries. The UAE has previously taken a hawkish stance on Iran and, along with Israel, it supported the 2018 decision of then-US President Donald Trump to abandon a landmark deal that limited Iran's nuclear activities in return for relief from international sanctions.  Iran has retaliated against the sanctions reinstated by Mr Trump by gradually violating key commitments under the agreement. It insists its nuclear programme is exclusively peaceful, but it is now enriching uranium to a purity just below the level needed for a bomb. Mr Bennett has accused Israel's arch-enemy of carrying out ""nuclear blackmail"" as a tactic in its negotiations with world powers in Vienna that are aimed at rescuing the deal by bringing Iran and the US back into compliance.  He wants US President Joe Biden to end the talks and take action against Iran, including imposing tighter sanctions and preparing for possible military strikes. The UAE has expressed opposition to such moves and sought to de-escalate tensions. ""We need to avoid a major conflict that will embroil the United States or indeed the countries in the region,"" presidential adviser Anwar Gargash told the US-based Arab Gulf States Institute last Thursday. ""Our interest is to try and avoid it at all costs."" You may also be interested in:"

Hawkish,Foo Fighters give loving send-off to Taylor Hawkins,2024-09-25,2022-09-03,By Mark Savage,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-62782108,"Foo Fighters frontman Dave Grohl choked back tears as he played the band's first show since the death of drummer Taylor Hawkins in March.  The star was singing Times Like These when he paused to collect his emotions on the lyric: ""It's times like these you learn to love again."" Earlier, Grohl described Hawkins as his ""dear friend,  bandmate and brother"". He said of Hawkins ""no-one else could make you smile or laugh or dance or sing like he could"". ""And for those of you that admired him from afar, I'm sure you've all felt the same thing,"" Grohl added. ""So sing and dance and laugh and cry and scream and make some noise so he can hear us right now."" Grohl was speaking as Foo Fighters topped the bill at an all-star concert in honour of Hawkins' life at London's Wembley Stadium.  The drummer was found dead in a hotel room in Colombia this March, shortly before Foo Fighters were due to play a festival in Bogotá. He was 50 years old.  No cause of death was announced, although a toxicology report showed traces of 10 substances in his body, including opioids, marijuana and anti-depressants.  Investigators did not say whether the mix of drugs was a factor. Saturday night's concert was the first of two gigs organised by the musician's wife and bandmates, with proceeds going to charities Music Support and MusiCares.  Sir Paul McCartney, Queen and AC/DC were among the rock royalty who showed up to pay tribute at Wembley; while Liam Gallagher opened the show with a fitting rendition of Oasis's Rock And Roll Star.  Sir Paul was a surprise addition to the line-up - giving a full-throttle rendition of The Beatles classic Helter Skelter, and duetting with Chrissie Hynde on Oh! Darling. ""A song I haven't performed since we recorded it 100 years ago,"" Sir Paul said. British 12-year-old Nandi Bushell, who went viral after challenging Grohl to a drum battle during lockdown, also got to join her heroes onstage, taking Hawkins' place during Learn To Fly.  Grohl introduced her as, ""one of the most badass drummers I've ever met in my life"".  She was one of several musicians to fill Hawkins' seat, including Blink-182's Travis Barker, Roger Taylor's son Rufus and Hawkins' 16-year-old son, Shane - who gave a thunderous performance of My Hero, on what can only have been an emotionally-charged night.  ""If you could only see how many drum sets are back there,"" joked Grohl. ""It's like your local music store."" It was a family affair through and through. Dave Grohl's daughter Violet, who had known Hawkins all her life, also gave beautiful, sensitive readings of Jeff Buckley's Grace and Amy Winehouse's version of Valerie - while her dad watched proudly from the side of the stage. The concert also featured performances from some of Hawkins' favourite bands and musicians, including Metallica, Rush, Supergrass and Stewart Copeland of The Police. ""The last few days we have been asking ourselves the same question after every rehearsal: 'I wonder what Taylor would think of this - to see all of these amazing people together making music?'"" said Grohl at one point, again struggling to contain his emotions.  There can't be many drummers whose death would warrant a Stadium-sized tribute, let alone two (a second date will be played in LA next week) - but Taylor Hawkins was no ordinary drummer.  His energy and positivity and passion for life were on display every time Foo Fighters took to the stage. He wasn't just Dave Grohl's sideman, he was his equal - playing with a grin as wide as the Grand Canyon, and the power to match.  Saturday night's concert was about capturing and celebrating that spirit. A gesture of love, instead of sadness. One that honoured his love of music, whether it was Jeff Buckley or George Michael.  ""He was a musicologist,"" Grohl told the audience. ""He knew more about music than anyone I'd ever met in my life."" That focus on Hawkins' favourite songs made the concert more personal than most benefit shows, where bands only appear to promote their latest album. Pop star Kesha tore into a sleazy version of T. Rex's Children Of The Revolution, while AC/DC's Brian Johnson lit up the stadium with muscular renditions of Back In Black and Let There Be Rock, accompanied by Grohl and Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich.  ""Taylor I know you're watching,"" said Ulrich from the stage. ""I know you can hear this, I know you can feel this. We love you."" The metal legends were also joined by Justin Hawkins from The Darkness - one of the day's most unstoppable performers, who brought a cocksure swagger to songs like Van Halen's Hot For Teacher and Queen's Under Pressure. Queen - Hawkins' favourite band - also ran through a compact set of their biggest hits, including We Will Rock You and Somebody To Love, the latter ably assisted by a jump-suited Sam Ryder.  Guitarist Brian May then led the crowd in an acoustic version of Love Of My Life, reflecting on the Freddie Mercury tribute concert that took place on the same stage 30 years ago. ""We said goodbye to Freddie in a style similar to this,"" he said, ""but I know Freddie would be very happy to use this song to honour Taylor"". Queen were the first group Hawkins ever saw live, at the age of 10; and he would regularly step out from behind his kit to serenade Foo Fighters' fans with one of their songs.  Somebody To Love was the last track he ever performed live, during a show in Argentina earlier this year.  Some sections of the tribute veered into self-indulgence. Wolfgang Van Halen's finger-twisting guitar riffs left the audience unmoved, while Josh Homme should never be allowed to sing Elton John's Goodbye Yellow Brick Road ever again.  Ohio band James Gang and Canadian prog rockers Rush laid bare the gulf between British audiences and disciples of US rock radio - although their technical skills were hard to deny.  Video tributes came from Elton John, Billie Eilish and Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer Chad Smith, who told the story of how Hawkins would visit his local music shop and buy instruments for aspiring drummers.  ""I love him and I miss him every day,"" he added.  ""Taylor's music and his passion will be remembered for ever and ever and so should his warmth and kindness with every person who was ever lucky enough to meet him,"" said Eilish in her tribute.  Fans leaving the show said it had helped them heal. ""Everybody is devastated, still, that he's gone, but after that, I feel better"" said Jennifer, who flew in from California to see the show. ""There were a lot of tears, a lot of emotions, but I think the band loved it. They were rocking out for him."" ""I think it was a release,"" agreed Sherilyn, who'd come from Norfolk with her partner, John. ""We were missing Taylor, that's for sure. I cried a lot. But everybody came together tonight. What more can you ask for?"" It was a sentiment that Grohl echoed on stage. ""We hope that you guys felt the love from all of us and all of the performers,"" he said, before closing the show with Everlong.  ""Because we felt it from you, for Taylor tonight."""

Hawkish,Where does Trump's 'America First' leave Canada?,2024-09-25,2018-05-02,By Jessica Murphy,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-43786775,"Donald Trump has been keeping Canada on its toes since he became US president at the start of last year. When it comes to matters of trade, Mr Trump has been resolutely hawkish, vowing repeatedly to put ""America first"". As the US is far and away Canada's largest trading partner, this has inevitably caused concern north of the border. And given that Mr Trump has repeatedly threatened to tear up the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) between the US, Canada, and Mexico, alarm in Ottawa has been somewhat justified. Especially as Donald Trump's administration has already hit Canadian softwood lumber with import tariffs of more than 20%. Mr Trump hasn't pulled the US out of Nafta, despite having once called it ""the worst trade deal ever made"". Instead talks have taken place since August of last year between US, Canadian and Mexican trade representatives to agree a new deal. While a deadline of 1 May to sign a new agreement came and went, a new one has been set for 1 June, and face-to-face talks are due to resume on 7 May. In Ottawa there is renewed optimism that a decent deal can be agreed. ""There is positive momentum, but as we all know it won't be done until it's done,"" Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Monday.  Yet despite key voices south of the border backing Canada's call for a positive new Nafta agreement, such as the US Chamber of Commerce, some Canadian industries remain nervous. ""There's a lot of worry,"" says Francois Dumontier, spokesman for the Milk Producers of Quebec organisation. Dairy farms in Quebec and across Canada in general are concerned about the talks because of Mr Trump's strong opposition to Canada's dairy supply management system. The long-running scheme, which is undeniably protectionist, offers Canadian farmers a guaranteed price for their milk, and puts high tariffs on dairy goods from abroad. Donald Trump has demanded an end to the system, arguing that it is unfair on American farms and shows that Canada has ""disregard"" for its trade obligations. Given that it has already been hit by large US tariffs the Canadian lumber industry is another sector concerned about the details of any new Nafta deal. The US government's complaint is that Canada is improperly subsidising its lumber industry by charging minimal fees to log public lands. This is a longstanding American frustration, and dispute over the issue has flared up repeatedly between the two countries over the past 30 years. In December, the US International Trade Commission ruled that Canadian lumber was being sold in the US at less than a fair price, which had ""materially harmed"" the industry in the US. Canada denies this. Susan Yurkovich, from the British Columbia Lumber Trade Council, says the industry is coping with the tariffs because demand from the US is currently so high. ""[But] if we were in a down market, it would be very different,"" she says. Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz has said that uncertainty over the Nafta deal is weighing on the Canadian economy, with investments being postponed or diverted south of the border.  However, the central bank's spring 2018 report showed a mixed picture among Canadian firms. While some said there were now ""challenges moving staff or goods across the border"", other companies told the bank they were hopeful their American subsidiaries would benefit from US tax cuts, or were optimistic about reaping benefits from strong economic growth in the US over the coming months.  Dan Ciuriak, from the Canadian economic think tank CD Howe Institute, says that trade between the two countries remains strong, but confidence has been ""shaken"" on the Canadian side. Last year trade between the US and Canada in both directions totalled $674bn (£494bn), according to the Office of the US Trade Representative.  Exports of US goods to Canada were 5.9% higher in 2017 than a year earlier, while exports of US services were up 8.8%. Going in the other direction, exports of Canadian goods to the US rose by 8%, while services expanded by 9.5%. To help secure a favourable new Nafta deal, Canada has launched a charm offensive in the US. Mr Trudeau and his cabinet ministers have been beating a path down to Washington and to US states with strong economic ties to Canada.  Marryscott Greenwood, an American who is chief executive of the Canadian American Business Council, a trade body that represents companies on both sides of the border, calls it ""almost a whole of Canada approach"". In addition to the prime minister and his colleagues, she says that provincial premiers, big city mayors, and former prime ministers have all also been making the case to American lawmakers to avoid protectionism and embrace Canada-US trade.  More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade: They are helped by numerous allies in the US who also want a decent new Nafta agreement, such as the US Chamber of Commerce. This powerful lobbying group has called some of Mr Trump's Nafta demands ""highly dangerous"", and have urged the president to protect Nafta's economic benefits.  Pro-trade US Republican governors have called on the president not to withdraw from the deal. Ms Greenwood guesses that Mr Trump does want a new Nafta deal, and that his harsh comments against the existing agreement was a way to ""get people's attention"" and ""forcing people to come to the table"". Until a deal is signed, Canada's steel and aluminium industries are two other sectors of the Canadian economy that remain nervous. They want a new Nafta agreement to give Canada permanent exemptions to US tariffs on metal imports. The issue is particularly pressing in Hamilton, Ontario, the largest steel manufacturing city in Canada, where 10,000 direct jobs depend on the product, and supply chains are heavily integrated with the US and Mexico. Keanin Loomis, president of the Hamilton Chamber of Commerce, was in Washington DC recently, and says he was encouraged at what seemed to be reinvigorated talks. ""We just have no idea how this will end up,"" he says. "
Hawkish,I've been left two weeks without ADHD medication,2024-09-25,2023-10-06,By Catriona Aitken,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-67021237,"A dad left without medication for two weeks due to supply issues says the rug has been pulled from under him. Simon Hawkins, from Caerphilly, said it was unnerving not to have his attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) tablets. It comes as prescribers are told not to offer certain ADHD medications to new patients while high demand and manufacturing issues are resolved. The Welsh government said other treatments were available.  Mr Hawkins, 35, was diagnosed with ADHD in January 2023 after struggling with concentration and memory. ""The best way to describe it is, if something is not right in front of my face, it's as if it doesn't exist,"" he said.  ""It's staying on top of all the regular day-to-day things that the vast majority of people don't think about.""  He added that swapping between tasks, such as in his IT job, could be exhausting.  ""All it takes is for an email to pop up and I lose track. Someone will ask you a question, even ask if you want a cup of coffee, and that's all it takes to ruin your train of thought,"" he said. ""Those distractions are just constant all day, every day."" The father-of-three was prescribed 70mg daily of a medication called Elvanse (lisdexamfetamine dimesylate) - the maximum recommended dosage of the drug.  ""With the medication, I have the energy to be able to pick something up, do it for a bit, and then do something else afterwards,"" he said. Mr Hawkins was diagnosed privately, after spending many years trying through the NHS.  It means he has to reapply for his medication from a psychiatrist each month, rather than having an automatic repeat prescription system.  ""That's not always easy, even if you don't have ADHD,"" he said. ""I was a touch late reordering but, if it had been filled fairly quickly, I wouldn't have run out.""  He said his pharmacy was really good at communicating so it was unnerving when he still did not have his tablets more than two weeks later. ""That feeling of finally getting somewhere, and then it's almost like the rug has been pulled out from under me,"" he said. Mr Hawkins said a wild goose chase followed, because the 70mg pills were out of stock. A combination of 20mg and 30mg tablets had to be approved by the psychiatrist because Elvanse is a controlled drug. Sitting in his psychiatrist's office, calling the pharmacy, they discovered the 30mg tablets were no longer available and agreed on 60mg, made up of 20mg tablets. But when Mr Hawkins got the prescription to the pharmacy, those were out of stock too. ""If I have got the time or energy I can ring around a bunch of other pharmacies that may have them,"" he said. ""But I work full time and it seems like it's such a widespread issue. ""It's stressful. I am definitely noticing things I was learning to cope with are becoming more difficult."" In an online document, NHS Wales, said various strengths of the following drugs were affected by supply disruptions: Methylphenidate:  Lisdexamfetamine:  Guanfacine:  Mr Hawkins said he was a mess while arranging a family tea party for his son's recent third birthday. ""I was frantically wrapping presents when I was supposed to be picking him up from nursery,"" he said. He said a system where pharmacies could share stock or supply records would help redirect patients.  Henry Shelford, charity ADHD UK's chief executive, said the sudden removal of medication was ""akin to removing a wheelchair from a disabled person that needs it"".  ""The NHS should have realised this was happening and had a plan. Instead, people are only finding out when their pharmacy can't supply,"" he said. ""They've been left stranded."" Community Pharmacy Wales said it was aware of the shortages and pharmacies had been told they were expected to resolve by December. ""We are aware that prescribers have been advised not to initiate new patients on products affected by this shortage until the supply issues resolve,"" it said. ""Community pharmacy teams continue to work hard across Wales to source medications for patients wherever possible."" The Welsh government said the shortages affected all parts of the UK, adding: ""On 27 September, we informed NHS Wales of the supply disruption and of mitigating actions.  ""This included information on alternative treatment options that are available such as sourcing unlicensed imported medicines."""
Hawkish,US tech and film 'collaborating' with China - Barr,2024-09-25,2020-07-16,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-53434147,"US Attorney General William Barr has accused Hollywood and US tech firms of ""collaborating"" with the Chinese government to do business there. Companies like Disney routinely agreed to censor films while Google, Yahoo, Microsoft and Apple were ""all too willing"" to work with Beijing, he said. Such actions risked undermining the liberal world order, Mr Barr added.  His intervention is the latest criticism of China by White House and other US officials. Tensions between the US and China have been rising over a host of issues. The US this week removed Hong Kong's preferential trade status, after China brought in a controversial new security law for the territory. President Donald Trump has also criticised China over its handling of the coronavirus pandemic as well as its military build-up in the South China Sea, its treatment of Muslim minorities, and massive trade surpluses. China has rejected all foreign criticism of its actions.  On Friday, in response to the latest allegations, its foreign ministry said US officials had ""lost their minds and gone mad"". Speaking at the Gerald Ford Presidential Museum, he warned that dependence on China for certain goods risked making the US vulnerable and said US firms were giving up secrets and compromising values under Chinese pressure. ""If Disney and other American corporations continue to bow to Beijing, they risk undermining both their own future competitiveness and prosperity, as well as the classical liberal order that has allowed them to thrive,"" he said. The justice department had seen growing numbers of cases where Chinese officials were lobbying US bosses to favour Beijing's policies, he said. He urged US firms to defy Chinese demands, saying: ""If individual companies are afraid to take a stand, there is strength in numbers."" He criticised technology companies, which he said had ""allowed themselves to become pawns of Chinese influence"".  He also alleged - without providing evidence - that the Chinese government was able to access Apple phones while the company had denied similar access to the US government, and that this was emblematic of a ""double standard that has been emerging among American tech companies"". ""Do you think when Apple sells phones in China, that Apple phones in China are impervious to penetration by Chinese authorities? They wouldn't be sold if they were impervious to Chinese authorities,"" he said.  Apple says it does not have a back door into its phones and will not build one. Mr Barr also praised Facebook, Google, Twitter, and LinkedIn for saying they would not comply with requests for user data under Beijing's new security law in Hong Kong. China's actions showed it did not want to join other industrialised economies but rather wanted to replace them entirely, he said.  Beijing sought to exploit the ""power, productivity and ingenuity"" of China's people to ""overthrow the rule-based international system and to make the world safe for dictatorship"". China was engaged in an ""economic blitzkrieg"" to ""seize the commanding heights of the global economy and to surpass the United States as the world's preeminent superpower"", he added. Zhaoyin Feng, BBC Chinese, Washington DC The Trump administration has long argued that China is taking advantage of America in trade. Mr Barr's remarks ramp up the accusation, alleging that China's ultimate goal in doing business with the US is to replace it and to become a world superpower.  ""Win-win in China means China wins twice,"" he said.  Mr Barr's remarks are among a series of hard-hitting speeches by senior US officials on China, including FBI Director Christopher Wray and National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo expected to follow.  All advocating for a tougher stance against Beijing, some of these speeches were delivered in key swing states like Michigan and Arizona.  Two days ago, President Trump voiced a range of grievances against China during a Rose Garden press conference, which quickly turned into an hour-long monologue attacking his Democratic rival Joe Biden. Campaign rhetoric and voices advocating for more hawkish policies towards China have become indistinguishable, as Mr Trump seems determined to make China a key pillar of his re-election strategy.  On Friday, a spokeswoman for China's foreign ministry said the country had no intention of replacing or challenging the US. Hua Chunying also said officials in Washington criticised China to distract from domestic issues.  ""These people, for self-interest and political gain, do not hesitate to hijack domestic public opinion... to the point where they have lost their minds and gone mad,"" she said. And on Thursday, the foreign ministry accused the White House of unfairly targeting China. ""We know that some in the US are oppressing China and bullying China. As an independent sovereign state, China must respond to the bullying practices and we must say no, we must... take reactive moves to it,"" Ms Hua said. She also responded to media reports that the US could ban Chinese Communist Party members from visiting the US, which she said were ""utterly pathetic"" if true. The Communist Party is the country's sole, ruling political party.  About 7% of the population are members of the party - loyal membership is essential for those who want to climb the career ladder - and members include e-commerce giant Alibaba's Jack Ma, telecomm company Huawei's founder Ren Zhengfei and  actress Fan Bingbing. Mr Barr's speech follows similar warnings about the impact of Chinese activity on the US by other US officials. Earlier this month FBI director Christopher Wray said acts of espionage and theft by China's government pose the ""greatest long-term threat"" to the future of the US. He said China had begun targeting Chinese nationals living abroad, coercing their return, and was working to compromise US coronavirus research. ""China is engaged in a whole-of-state effort to become the world's only superpower by any means necessary,"" Mr Wray added."

Hawkish,N Korea threatens to cancel Trump summit,2024-09-25,2018-05-16,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-44134910,"North Korea has said it may pull out of a summit with US President Donald Trump if the US insists it gives up its nuclear weapons unilaterally. The highly anticipated meeting between Mr Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong-un is due to take place on 12 June. But in an angry statement, North Korea's vice-foreign minister accused the US of making reckless statements and of harbouring sinister intentions. He pointed the finger squarely at US National Security Adviser John Bolton.  ""We do not hide our feeling of repugnance towards him,"" Kim Kye-gwan said.     The White House has responded by saying it is still hopeful the meeting will go ahead.  ""The president is ready if the meeting takes place. If it doesn't, we'll continue the maximum pressure campaign that's been ongoing,"" said spokesperson Sarah Sanders.   The groundbreaking agreement for Mr Kim and Mr Trump to meet came about as North Korea said it was committed to denuclearising the Korean peninsula.  Exactly what that would entail has remained unclear, but North Korea has invited foreign media to witness the dismantling of its main nuclear test site later this month. Mr Bolton recently said North Korea could follow a ""Libya model"" of verifiable denuclearisation, but this alarms Pyongyang, which watched Libya's Colonel Gaddafi give up his nuclear programme only for him to be killed by Western-backed rebels a few years later. The BBC's Laura Bicker in Seoul says North Korea - which had long said its nuclear arsenal is essential for its survival as a state - is now making its demands clear. Laura Bicker, BBC News, Seoul  The whole reason it has spent years building up a nuclear arsenal, at such a great cost, is for survival.  So to compare denuclearisation in North Korea with Libya or indeed Iraq as John Bolton did on Sunday is not going to offer much comfort. Both regimes collapsed.  This is also a warning shot to the Trump administration. They will be aware how much Mr Trump wants this summit and how it is being spun as a success brought about by his maximum pressure strategy.  There were signs this boasting irritated Pyongyang, but now it has decided to speak out through someone in a position of power.   North Korea wants the world to know that it is coming to the negotiating table from a position of strength, and they may feel that they are making all the concessions.  They've suspended all missile tests, released the three US detainees, Kim Jong-un met President Moon and the pair signed a declaration, and they're about to dismantle a nuclear test site in front of international media.  So to hear the Trump administration claiming credit for a deal they don't like has been a step too far.  These statements more than hint that North Korea is prepared to walk away from President Trump's summit in Singapore until it does hear a deal it does like. Mr Kim's statement, carried by state media, said that if the US ""corners us and unilaterally demands we give up nuclear weapons we will no longer have an interest in talks"" and ""will have to reconsider"" attending the 12 June summit in Singapore. He said North Korea did have ""high hopes"" but that it was ""very unfortunate that the US is provoking us ahead of the summit by spitting out ludicrous statements"". Kim Kye-gwan is known to be highly respected in the North Korean leadership and has taken part in negotiations with the US before. There is very little chance his comments were not personally endorsed by Kim Jong-un. Hours before the announcement, in a sign of growing problems, North Korea had also pulled out of a meeting scheduled with South Korea on Wednesday. because of anger over the start of US-South Korea joint military drills.  North Korea had earlier said it would allow them to go ahead, but then called them ""a provocative military ruckus"" which was undermining its diplomatic efforts.   The sudden change in tone from Pyongyang is said to have taken US officials by surprise. Analysts said North Korea could be trying to strengthen its hand before talks. The US state department said it was continuing to plan the Trump-Kim meeting, and Mr Trump is yet to comment. A Chinese government spokesman urged North Korea and the US to ""meet each other halfway"" ahead of negotiations.  The hawkish conservative is a firm defender of US power and a confrontational advocate for wielding that strength abroad. He has previously said it would be ""perfectly legitimate"" to carry out a pre-emptive strike on North Korea.   In media interviews over the weekend, he said North Korea could follow a Libyan model of nuclear disarmament - Libya gave up its weapons' programmes in the early 2000s and only then secured economic aid and normalised relations with the US. However during the 2011 uprising against Colonel Gaddafi's regime, Western powers intervened in Libya in favour of the rebels, and Gaddafi was captured and killed. North Korea has in the past suggested that Libya may have escaped Western military intervention had it kept its nuclear weapons programme.  Kim Kye-gwan said in his statement that this was ""not an expression of intention to address the issue through dialogue"". ""It is essentially a manifestation of awfully sinister moves to impose on our dignified state the destiny of Libya or Iraq which had been collapsed due to yielding the whole of their countries to big powers. ""We do not hide our feeling of repugnance towards [Bolton].""  Mr Kim also warns Mr Trump that if he ""follows in the footsteps of his predecessors"" - refusing to engage with North Korea unless it gives up its nuclear weapons - ""he will be recorded as more tragic and unsuccessful president than his predecessors, far from his initial ambition to make unprecedented success"".

Hawkish,Farm death accused 'banned machine use',2024-09-25,2018-11-01,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-46062736,"A smallholder on trial for the manslaughter of a farm volunteer said he did not let her use the unsafe milling machine that killed her. Neil Carpenter broke down in tears as he told a jury about finding the body of Lauren Scott, 20, on his farm at Dawlish, Devon, on 4 March 2017. Miss Scott, who had been helping out at the smallholding, died after her hair and clothing became entangled in the drive shaft of a milling machine. Mr Carpenter denies manslaughter. The 40-year-old, from Dawlish, is accused of causing Miss Scott's death by gross negligence. He told Exeter Crown Courte would never have let her use the machine ""in a month of Sundays"" - and only used it himself when it was fenced off. He said he knew the milling machine was potentially dangerous and banned Miss Scott and other volunteers from trying to use it. See more news from Devon The prosecution allege that he ought to have repaired the broken covering on the shaft which connected the machine to a tractor and powered it, known as a power take-off (PTO). They say he must have known about the milling operation because he was seen starting the tractor in the background of a video filmed by Miss Scott but he denies this. Mr Carpenter said he found her on the ground after hearing a bang. ""She shouldn't have been down there,"" he said. ""There was no need for her to be there. It was never one of her jobs."" Asked about the video, he said he could not remember starting the tractor. He said: ""The machine was broken and we were not milling corn. I had no reason to get on the tractor."" He added that in ""hindsight"" he should have bought a new cover for the PTO. The trial continues."
Hawkish,Stephen Hawking: The book that made him a star,2024-09-25,2018-03-14,By Simon Mitton,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-43404524,"Stephen Hawking was the most remarkable author I had the privilege of working with during my career as the director of science publishing at Cambridge University Press.  In 1982, I had responsibility for his third academic book for the Press, Superspace And Supergravity.   This was a messy collection of papers from a technical workshop on how to devise a new theory of gravity.  While that book was in production, I suggested he try something easier: a popular book about the nature of the Universe, suitable for the general market.  Stephen mulled over my suggestion.  He already had an international reputation as a brilliant theoretical physicist working on rotating black holes and theories of gravity.  And he had concerns about financial matters: importantly, it was impossible for him to obtain any form of life insurance to protect his family in the event of his death or becoming total dependent on nursing care.  So, he took precious time out from his research to prepare the rough draft of a book.  At the time, several bestselling physics authors had already published non-technical books on the early Universe and black holes.  Stephen decided to write a more personal approach, by explaining his own research in cosmology and quantum theory.  As he himself pointed out it, his area of interest had ""become so technical that only a very small number of specialists could master the mathematics"" used to describe it.  For a starting point, he took some themes from a course of advanced lectures that he had recently given at Harvard University.  These had catchy titles such as ""The edge of spacetime"", ""Black holes and  thermodynamics"", and ""Quantum gravity"". In the 1980s, my office and Stephen's were in the same courtyard in central Cambridge, so I often chatted with him about publishing.  One afternoon he invited me to take a look at the first draft, but first he wanted to discuss cash.  He told me he had spent considerable time away from his research, and that he expected advances and royalties to be large.  When I pressed him on the market that he foresaw, he insisted that it had to be on sale, up front, at all airport bookshops in the UK and the US.  I told him that was a tough call for a university press.  Then I thumbed the typescript. To my dismay, the text was far too technical for a general reader.  A few weeks later he showed me a revision, much improved, but still littered with equations.   I said: ""Steve, it's still too technical - every equation will halve the market.""  He eventually removed all except one, E = mc². And he decided, fortunately, to place it with a mass market publisher rather than a university press. Bantam published A Brief History of Time in March 1988.  Sales took off like a rocket, and it ranked as a bestseller for at least five years.  Total sales approached 10 million copies.  The book's impact on the popularisation of science has been incalculable.  Stephen was an inspirational ambassador for the power of science to provide rational accounts of the physical laws governing the natural world.

Hawkish,Stephen Hawking: The science that made him famous,2024-09-25,2018-03-14,By Roland Pease,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-43399340,"Prof Stephen Hawking has died aged 76. The Cambridge theoretical physicist was one of the best-known scientists in the world, but what about his discoveries? His fame among researchers was founded on a series of studies that wed Albert Einstein's great theory of gravity, general relativity, with the strange world of quantum mechanics, normally applied to tiny things like atoms and molecules.  What Hawking ended up with were descriptions of black holes that could boil themselves out of existence, and equations that described the entire history of the Universe in a single sweep. Hawking’s first forays into science publication were as a student in the 1960s when he’d had only the first intimations of the motor neurone disease that would become such a big part of his life.  With Oxford mathematician Roger Penrose, he showed that if there was a Big Bang, it must have started from an infinitely small point - in physicist-speak, a “singularity”. At the time, when the still cooling afterglow of the Big Bang (the cosmic microwave background radiation) had only just been detected on the sky, other cosmologists had hoped for something less radical than the notion of an entire Universe emerging out of nothing.  Together, Hawking and Penrose showed the quest for gentler answers was hopeless. Hawking’s next venture, in the 1970s, was to show that black holes are not black at all, but are in fact, as the title of one paper put it, “white hot”.  Black holes are the ultimate monster of general relativity. First conceived and named by John Wheeler, they are regions of space so dense that everything within their realm collapses to a single point – another example of a singularity. At the time, it seemed ridiculous that these gorgons of gravity should have anything to do with the delicate theory of quantum mechanics, designed to explain light and the orbits of electrons in atoms. But Hawking showed otherwise. In fact, quantum theory completely changes the fate of black holes.  At their very fringes, Hawking demonstrated, black holes would create and radiate new particles due to these laws, losing energy, and hence losing mass (remember Einstein's equation E=mc²).  It would take a black hole a very long time to evaporate in this way, but in its last moments Hawking said it would expire in a burst of energy equivalent to a million megaton hydrogen bombs. When the Large Hadron Collider was opened in the Swiss/French countryside outside Geneva, there was hope that the particle accelerator might be able to create microscopic black holes and so prove Hawking's ideas.  A Nobel Prize would then have been a certainty. But the LHC has seen nothing yet.  Having tackled single black holes, Hawking turned his attention to the Universe as a whole - the ultimate, inescapable gravitational container.  The laws of quantum science are as applicable here as to a vanishing black hole, especially at the first moment, the Big Bang. While other researchers struggled to depict a brief moment in the life of a molecule using quantum laws, Hawking showed it was possible to encapsulate the entire history of the whole Universe in a single mathematical expression – “The Wavefunction of the Universe”, as he called it.  Because the expression is self-contained - it starts at a singularity at the beginning of time and is closed by another at the end of time, and if necessary, history can bounce back and forth between these two book ends.  There is no need, indeed no point, to ask what happened before the Big Bang. An existing Universe would explain itself on its own terms. Hawking continued working on the ramifications of this theory to the end of his life.  To know that such a mathematical description might exist is one thing; to know which expression is the right one is a far harder job.  Stephen Hawking’s mind was not the all-conquering juggernaut of public myth.  Like any scientist, he got it wrong from time to time, and often had to concede defeat in intellectual combat.  We sometimes know of this because of his predilection for laying down fanciful bets over debated points – a year’s subscription to Playboy versus one for Private Eye, in one instance.  This happened in 2004, when he conceded to computer scientist John Preskill that black holes were not the ultimate information shredders in the Universe (a consequence he perceived of his black hole theories that would have undermined some of the most fundamental laws of physics). Hawking accepted black holes could store information about their past, encoded somehow at their edges - the so-called event horizon.   Many researchers were frustrated by the ease with which Stephen Hawking generated publicity, often overshadowing other talents with equally extraordinary or challenging ideas.  His papers were typically at the extremes of mathematical science, a further step along the path he’d chosen to follow in his student days; but they were not always close to the central scientific issues of the day. Nevertheless, his ability to project his intellectual enthusiasm beyond his frail body, and to draw the wider public into abstruse realms of science is undeniable. "
Hawkish,The inside story of Arteta's Arsenal rebuild,2024-09-25,2022-05-12,BBC Sport,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/61411433,"One of the things Mikel Arteta has done while in charge of Arsenal is plant an olive tree in the grounds outside his office. He bought it not just as a reflection of his ideal football culture but also as a metaphor for Arsenal Football Club. While the fruit and leaves are the showpiece of the tree - the top players if you like - they are no more vital to its flourishing than the branches that hold them and the roots that grow beneath it. For Arteta, those roots are the people who help the first team flourish and embody the core values that will make the club bigger and richer - such as respect, humility, a willingness to suffer and a no-blame culture. Without these roots, the top of the tree would wither and die. In April, after a run of three defeats against Crystal Palace, Brighton and Southampton, Arteta held a team meeting around that olive tree, where he talked them through this philosophy. It might well be a coincidence but Arsenal have won four straight games since that meeting and are a win against Tottenham on Thursday away from qualifying for the Champions League for the first time since 2015-16. This video can not be played Arsenal do not need any more motivation for derby - Arteta The injuries Arteta, now 40, suffered at the end of his playing career made him think long and hard about his profession. He would spend up to 12 hours a day attached to scanners, speaking to doctors, being treated by physios and so on. He tried everything he could to recover - a battle he was destined to lose - and gradually he had to accept his playing time was at an end. He has never forgotten that something he loved so dearly was taken away from him, a feeling that still drives him. His playing CV boasted 14 years in the top flight of English and Scottish football, having grown up in the Barcelona youth system and also played at Paris St-Germain, where he crossed paths with Mauricio Pochettino, then a player at the team he now manages. His career has also been touched by managers like David Moyes at Everton and Arsene Wenger at Arsenal, and he later drew on that experience to build a working relationship with Pep Guardiola, spending plenty of their time together on the Manchester City coaching staff asking questions in his quest to improve.  The experience he gained working with Guardiola was priceless, not least because it helped him refine his thinking process and establish his own philosophy. He has always been a student of the game and, after looking deeply into the Premier League, now understands every aspect of it, from the interaction needed with the media, referees and fans, to knowing all about other teams. In the last year of his coaching apprenticeship at City, he knew he was ready to take on a big job. He was interviewed by Arsenal before they appointed Unai Emery in 2018, while other clubs such as Lyon and Newcastle were also interested in signing him. Style-wise he is similar to his mentor Guardiola, although more along the lines of Premier League Pep - circa 2020 - rather than the Barcelona or Bayern Munich Pep of 2008 or 2012.  But in terms of his leadership, he is totally different to his great friend and former colleague. We will get to that. Having been an assistant, one of his primary aims on joining Arsenal was to make sure he had the right coaching staff around him. Arriving with him was assistant manager Steve Round, who brought with him a wealth of experience from working at clubs including Everton, Manchester United, Derby and Aston Villa. There was also Albert Stuivenberg, the former coach at Belgium club Genk and former assistant manager of Manchester United and Wales. He chose them because he trusted them to ask the right questions, to have similar expectations, the same standards and integrity, and the necessary understanding of leadership, tactics and gameplans that could help Arsenal to win at this level.  They also had to ask themselves whether they had a synergy with Arteta that would help him succeed at the start of his coaching journey. The answer was positive and they all came to north London to win. But first came the necessary step of changing the culture of a club that has not qualified for the Champions League since Wenger was in charge. Victory for Arsenal over Tottenham on Thursday would secure them their highest Premier League finish (at least fourth) since the 2015-16 campaign, when they finished second Working with Arteta on a daily basis is never going to be easy because he expects from those around him the kind of energy, passion and drive he expects from himself. Most days he arrives at the training ground at around 8am and he ensures everyone is on their toes from the very start. I have heard people compare him to their favourite schoolteacher, someone whose expectations can be intimidating but similarly someone who you are genuinely fond of and who you know can bring the very best out of you. He is a non-stop, perpetually driven ball of energy - but also fundamentally a man of compassion, a caring person with a natural sense of justice and someone whose main aim is to seek happiness and harmony in the dressing room. It means he has to build and design a group that can create that required dynamic. That meant players like Shkodran Mustafi, Mesut Ozil, Sead Kolasinac and most recently Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang were never going to last too long with Arteta at the helm. Once he makes his mind up about the way he wants to go, he is unmovable. The pressure on all fronts for him to make peace with Ozil was as pointless as it was remorseless. Once he decided the German was surplus to requirements - a football decision based on his performance and attitude - his judgement was backed by the board and the German's stay at the club was over. In his first club-wide meetings at Arsenal, Arteta spoke to the first team and all the staff about how lucky and privileged he was to have been given one of the great jobs in football at one of its top clubs in one of the greatest cities in the world.  But the fine words came with a caveat - namely that while they should all enjoy every privileged minute they had, they were all still going to have to work hard and to suffer. But they should enjoy the hard work that lay ahead. It is said that one of Wenger's obsessions was loyalty to all those around him, which in the end made it difficult for him to implement much-needed changes. Also everything went through him, and in a modern club that is no longer an efficient way to run things. Arteta is much more ruthless than Wenger, especially when working out just what somebody can bring to the club. He will not hesitate to grasp the nettle when it comes to making career-defining decisions regarding players. Wenger's loyalty frequently clouded his judgement and the unwillingness of those close to him to change or adapt helped create the malaise that affected the club by the time of his departure. Under Arteta there are new methods in place, creating a new energy. Emery helped by instilling a competitiveness at all levels but Arteta, considered more empathetic by the people who have known both regimes, has taken that to another level. Gradually the message is coming across and the culture is being transformed. The players are now finding themselves constantly challenged; competitiveness rather than a comfort blanket of mediocrity is now everywhere at the club. He has introduced maths and mind games, competitions among players and, above all, he and his staff spend much of the time noticing who leads the discussions, who is the most proactive and who consistently fails to join in. He realises the devil is always in the minor details. It is for that reason he loves the contribution now being made by Martin Odegaard - intelligent, intuitive, empathetic, always willing to put the team first, constantly looking to improve. Gone are the 'sick note' excuses that used to exist at Arsenal, with players looking for reasons not to play. That has been replaced with a desire from everyone to play every game, or at least do whatever is needed to put themselves in contention. Arteta and his team will always look to those players who will go that extra mile not for themselves but for the team. He also makes a point of getting close to them and all their families. When a key member of staff was considering another job offer, Arteta made it his business to contact his wife directly and ask her what she needed to make sure both she and her husband were happy at the club. It is that attention to detail that marks much of the difference in this new regime. His match talks - be they pre-match, half-time or full-time - are genuinely inspirational and he always somehow seems to get the right tone with an intensity I am reliably informed brings out goose bumps on the most seasoned professionals. Diego Maradona's death, Ukraine and the return of fans following their absence during the Covid-19 pandemic are some of the issues he has used to relate to players emotionally. He is not the quickest to admit when he has made a mistake, although he invariably knows when he has done so. He is also not averse to taking risks if he feels that is the right thing to do, even against the judgement sometimes of those close to him. That means sometimes he probably feels a bit isolated, with his mind constantly looking forward, always a step ahead. At the moment the relationship is very good with owner Stan Kroenke and his son Josh, with whom Arteta has the most interaction. His message to them has always been that the most important thing at the club is its structure, and while he continually tries to get the best footballers to the club, equally important to him is striving to be - and be seen to be - the best at getting those players to climb aboard the Arsenal train. Sometimes it means there are difficult conversations. He has had meetings with the owners where, pen in hand, he has defined what his vision for the club is in the short, medium and long term. Things like this would suggest he already carries the club on his shoulders. His relationship with technical director Edu is so close that many assume they have known each other for years. The reality is the two men's paths never crossed in their Arsenal playing days and they only met for the first time shortly before the interview stage for the manager's job - although the bond is now so strong that they are helping each other to create that competitive culture. The first time they ever spoke was on the phone and they spent the first hour talking about everything other than football. The connection that existed between the two was palpable from the outset and has gone from strength to strength in some darkish moments. When Edu arrived at the club, there were things that were missing - it certainly wasn't the club he had left as a player in 2005 - so he needed little persuading in trying to create the new culture Arteta was looking for. He saw in Arteta a well-prepared coach with the style and clear ideology to take the club forward and a man who wanted the same as he did. Edu also knew it would take a while to put in place that style and structure, and Arteta knows it is still a work in progress and that he has to build it day in, day out. The Spaniard is not averse to taking advice from those in power at the club and even from those around him but he is fundamentally his own man, one who knows his own mind and is definitely not for turning. He is well aware the buck stops with him. A win over Tottenham on Thursday would make this the first season since 2015-16 that Arsenal have finished above their north London rivals Arteta can be found on the training pitch every day but he also delegates to his extensive coaching staff when work is needed in specific areas. He will also get involved even if, for whatever reason, there are only a few of the senior players present, because he believes it is his duty to be seen to be doing his work. Like so many of those in his pressured profession, he does not deal particularly well with defeat and will spend hours looking at the mistakes his team have made - but also ones he might have made himself. The woeful performance that led to a 3-0 loss at Crystal Palace at the start of April came out of the blue and was then compounded by an arguably worse one in their home defeat by Brighton. To say it shocked Arteta would be an understatement, although he dealt with it by telling his players he was going to go home and take a long hard look at himself and then try to work out what the mistakes were. He told them it would make him suffer and that if he was prepared to do that then he expected his players to be big enough to do the same thing. He realises he can only pick 11 starters and use three substitutes per game and, to that end, he goes out of his way to connect with those players who do not make the cut for the big games, emphasising to them that it is not personal and stressing just how important and integral a part they are of the whole project. At the start of the season when things were not looking rosy and they lost their first three games, he never lost the dressing room and not a single player or member of his coaching team said a bad word about him. That is certainly something that was not always true during the reigns of Wenger or Emery. Arteta is not renowned for being a joker and his way of thanking people and getting closer to them is to spend time with them. He is not totally divorced from the British sense of humour but prefers to build relationships via events like barbecues and other informal gatherings. He frequently invites his friends and colleagues to his house to break bread and display his culinary skills.  Many clubs take their teams to places like Dubai during international breaks but not all of them do as Arsenal did recently and take all the families with them. It was a chance for the manager to show his more relaxed side, surrounded by his nearest and dearest. If there is a bereavement at the club he will always send flowers. He always celebrates Christmas, which includes giving away huge Iberico ham legs from his Spanish home of San Sebastian, of which he is so proud.  His family is his rock, especially his best friend and wife, Lorena Bernal, who has temporarily parked her career as a model and actress to help her husband settle in his new professional role. He is also a frequent visitor to the home of Edu. The Brazilian has become someone he can turn to during the most difficult and trying times, as at the beginning of the season or during their bad run in early April, someone who will pat him on the back, tell him to relax and reassure him that things are going in the right direction. Fundamentally everyone at the club, including Edu, recognises how good a coach he is and how potentially great he could become. He obviously can't do it on his own and they are clearly not yet where they want to be. He realises his own limitations and knows perhaps he needs to address such things as his behaviour on the touchline, or an excess of meetings and the length of them - but much of it is caused by the fact he is so intense, so involved. With time a more balanced approach will appear. With a top-four finish still not assured, the Arsenal board have shown their faith in him with a contract extension that could see him at the club until at least the end of the 2024-25 season. But before then there is much work to be done, which will probably include three or four squad changes before he genuinely feels he has under his control a dressing room he can call his own. The fear of course is that the intensity that is his calling card will lead to eventual burnout. But we are a million miles away from that and for the time being he has the passion, energy and dedication to ensure he takes this Arsenal side back to where their supporters feel they belong.

He is known to be more hawkish than Mr Tillerson and a number of pundits remember unfavourable comments he has made on their countries in the past.   Many expect a tougher line from him and worry about what this means for international and bilateral relations.  Tillerson's sacking was widely reported on all Iranian media outlets, with one of the main state radio stations describing it as ""new political turbulence"" in Washington.  The general sentiment of responses in newspapers is that Mr Trump is putting together a team hostile to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) on Iran's nuclear programme, in order to change the deal.  This is the case from both reformist and conservative political camps.  ""Tillerson's dismissal was to dismiss the JCPOA,"" said one headline in the hardline newspaper Javan. ""Anti-JCPOA circle completed in the White House,"" read another in the pro-reform Afkar. In the Gulf, Mr Tillerson's exit has been touted by some on Twitter as a sign of successful diplomatic pressure from the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia for him to go, over his lack of support for their economic blockade against Qatar.  The hashtag #Tillerson in Arabic was the top trend in the UAE and one of the more popular tweets was from an Emirati political science professor Abdul Khaleq Abdullah saying ""History will relay that a Gulf country had a role in the firing of the secretary of state of a great power."" ""It is worthy to note that the decision coincided with Trump's anticipation of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's visit,"" added one Saudi user.  China, Japan and South Korea believe the appointment will not change bilateral relations with the US but there are concerns for what it will mean in negotiations in general and with North Korea.  One of China's main newspapers, The Global Times, noted that most of those who had left or been fired from Trump's team were ""moderates"" like Mr Tillerson. ""As soon as Pompeo enters the State Department, those brakes that Tillerson helped Trump step on will turn immediately into his constant throttle,"" said the paper's editorial.  South Korea's news agency Yonhap echoed this wariness: ""Tillerson is known for his relatively dovish approach toward North Korea... he has sought to resolve the North's nuclear and missile issues through peaceful methods, including talks and dialogue."" Some also took the move as a signal of Mr Trump's seriousness in wanting to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.  The Korea Herald quoted a university professor saying that giving Mr Pompeo the task of preparing for North Korea-US talks signalled Mr Trump's determination to negotiate with Mr Kim. North Korean media have not yet been observed to comment in response.  Turkish media also noted America's likely change of tone with Mr Pompeo. ""Rex left, hawk came"" was the headline on the mainstream newspaper Hurriyet.  Mr Pompeo has a reputation in Turkish media for having anti-Turkish views, having previously categorised the country as a ""totalitarian Islamist dictatorship"".   Mr Tillerson's going also prompted some concern for a deal Turkey just struck with the US over Manbij, a Kurdish-held town in northern Syria where Turkey is currently carrying out ground operations against Kurdish fighters.Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu was due to meet Mr Tillerson in Washington on 19 March to discuss details. In Russia, commentators shrugged off the move to an extent, given the already tense relations between the two countries.   ""Amid a cold war between Russia and the US, the reshuffle of people at top state posts... does not influence Washington's policy,"" said one pundit in the business daily RBC. Another commentator in the moderate newspaper Izvestia echoed this view but added that accusations of interfering in the US domestic affairs might ""become far more bitter"".  Popular daily Moskovsky Komsomolets also warned that  a ""friendly disposition towards our country should not be expected from Pompeo"".  Mr Pompeo's appointment also raised concerns in Latin America, particularly in Venezuela. Opposition news website La Patilla saw Mr Pompeo as a ""recurring nightmare"" for left-wing Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, a fierce critic of Mr Trump and his policies. The pro-government news website La Iguana TV noted that Mr Pompeo was among the ""main initiators"" of US economic sanctions against Venezuela and said he had been ""more aggressive"" towards Venezuela than Mr Tillerson.

Hawkish,Black chemistry professor elected to Royal Society,2024-09-25,2023-05-11,By Jennifer Harby,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-65547281,"An academic who is believed to be the country's only black professor of chemistry has been elected fellow of the Royal Society. Robert Mokaya, from the University of Nottingham, was announced as one of the latest cohorts of fellows at the oldest science academy in continuing existence. Prof Mokaya said he was delighted. The Royal Society said its latest cohort was at the forefront of the response to global challenges. The university said Prof Mokaya's research in the area of porous carbons as sustainable energy materials had been pivotal. It added it believed he was the only black professor of chemistry in the country. He said: ""I'm delighted and honoured to be elected a fellow of the Royal Society, and very grateful to the excellent students and postdocs that I have had over the years and to my collaborators and mentors. ""I thank my wife and children for their love and support, and my parents and siblings from whom much of my inspiration has come. ""I am also grateful to those who have supported my work at the School of Chemistry and across the university."" The Royal Society said it had elected 59 fellows this year. Its previous fellows and foreign members have included Stephen Hawking, Sir Isaac Newton, Charles Darwin and Albert Einstein. Sir Adrian Smith, president of the Royal Society, said: ""I am delighted to welcome our newest cohort of fellows.   ""They are pioneering scientists and innovators from around the world who have confounded expectations and transformed our thinking.""

Hawkish,Rarely seen black swan spotted on waterway,2024-09-25,2019-12-22,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-50873371,"A rare sighting of a black swan has been made in Pembrokeshire. Photographer Giles Davies saw the swan among a group of white ones on the Milford Haven waterway, on Saturday. ""It's unusual, really unusual... the first time I've seen them, I've never seen anything like it before,"" Mr Davies said. He studied the swan for some time and it is ""in good condition"" and ""living quite happily"" among the other swans. ""As for where it's come from, not a clue. I don't know,"" he added. ""The swans often group together on the waterway during winter."" Black swans are common in the wetlands of south western and eastern Australia and adjacent coastal islands.  A pair of black swans were sent as a gift to Winston Churchill from the government of the day in Western Australia. Some black swans are still at Chartwell in Kent, once the home of Churchill and now a National Trust property. A study of bird populations in 2012 found there were 37 confirmed nesting pairs of black swans in the country. In Dawlish, Devon, the bird has become a symbol of the town. "
Hawkish,"PM defends premiership, and Ukraine's weapons pleas",2024-09-25,2022-04-23,By BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-the-papers-61205355,"An investigation by the Sunday Times has, in the paper's words, ""laid bare the obfuscation, foot-dragging and failure at the heart of the British government to confront the threat posed by Russia"" over the past seven years. It claims that as prime minister, David Cameron, Theresa May and Boris Johnson all refused repeated requests from Ukraine to buy weapons from the UK because of fears about provoking Russian President Vladimir Putin.  The paper's leader column delivers a damning verdict on what it calls the failure of successive governments to grasp the danger posed by Moscow, noting that ""the few voices who called for a more hawkish approach were sidelined in favour of a policy amounting to appeasement"". The Sunday Express says Mr Johnson has delivered a full-throttled defence of his premiership amid what the paper describes as a firm belief in Downing Street that he can put the Partygate saga behind him. It reports that Mr Johnson highlighted 10 landmark measures due to become law this week as proof that he is delivering for Britain. But according to the Observer, plans to ditch the prime minister sooner rather than later are being advanced by a growing number of senior Conservatives. It says there is mounting alarm amongst Tories at the effects Partygate could have on their electoral chances, prompting senior MPs to urge wavering colleagues to strike before it is too late. Sign up for a morning briefing direct to your inbox The home secretary has told the Sunday Telegraph that the BBC was guilty of xenophobia when reporting the government's plan to send some asylum-seekers to Rwanda. Priti Patel says she was taken aback by the tone of BBC journalists' references to the African country when she announced the agreement 10 days ago. The BBC says its journalists asked questions about the scheme. Ms Patel also claims there were undercurrents of xenophobia in parliament - but she insists she remains fully behind the plans - and reveals she is now looking for other potential countries with which similar agreements could be struck.   A renewed call by the government's efficiency minister for civil servants to stop working at home is featured by the Mail on Sunday. Writing in the paper, Jacob Rees-Mogg warns that public sector workers based in London could be sacked if they refuse to return to Whitehall, arguing ""if people are not back in their office, it will be fair to assume the job does not need to be in London"". His view is backed by the Mail's leader column, which insists working from home is a bad habit that is ruining the economy. With the headline, ""Rishi in hot water again"", the Sunday People says the chancellor has angered voters for the second time in weeks, following the row about his wife's tax affairs. It reports that Rishi Sunak is planning to spend up to £13,000 a year heating his new swimming pool at his home in North Yorkshire. The paper says that figure is six-and-a-half times the average annual energy bill for a family home and has sparked outrage amongst his constituents at a time of soaring gas prices. Mr Sunak declined to comment."
Hawkish,Hart quits as Oscars host amid tweets row,2024-09-25,2018-12-07,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-46479017,"US comedian and actor Kevin Hart says he has stepped down from hosting the 2019 Oscars following a controversy over homophobic tweets. He said he did not want to be a distraction and that he was ""sorry he had hurt people"". The choice of Hart for host was only announced on Tuesday.  But tweets from a decade ago emerged of anti-gay slurs, sparking calls for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to drop him. Kevin Hart had said hosting the Oscars was ""a goal on my list for a long time"". But in a tweet late on Thursday he said he had chosen to step down ""because I do not want to be a distraction on a night that should be celebrated by so many amazing talented artists"". He said: ""I sincerely apologise to the LGBTQ community for my insensitive words of the past."" Comments Hart made during a comedy routine in 2010 have been put under the spotlight in recent days. ""One of my biggest fears is my son growing up and being gay. That's a fear,"" he told the audience. ""Keep in mind, I'm not homophobic, I have nothing against gay people, be happy. Do what you want to do.  ""But me, being a heterosexual male, if I can prevent my son from being gay, I will."" In 2015, by which time his profile had risen significantly, Hart addressed the stand-up routine in question in an interview with Rolling Stone. ""I wouldn't tell that joke today, because when I said it, the times weren't as sensitive as they are now,"" he said.  ""I think we love to make big deals out of things that aren't necessarily big deals, because we can."" When he revealed he would be the Oscars host earlier this week, Hart said it was the ""opportunity of a lifetime for me as a comedian"" and that his mother was ""smiling from ear to ear right now"". Earlier on Thursday it had appeared he would try to ride out the storm. In an Instagram post he spoke out against the ""negative energy"" of the criticism, saying people should ""stop searching for reasons to be angry."" He said he was almost 40 years old and was ""in love with the man I'm becoming"". In a later video, he said he had been called by the Academy and asked to apologise or another host would be found.  ""I chose to pass. I passed on the apology,"" he said, repeating his assertion that the issue of the tweets had been addressed in the past. He appeared to later change his mind and issue an apology as he stood down. Parks and Recreation actor Billy Eichner welcomed the news on Twitter. ""As one of very few openly gay men in comedy who's fortunate enough to work as much as I do, I will always fight for my LGBTQ community to get the respect we deserve,"" he said. But others online expressed disappointment about Hart stepping down, including former Golden Globes host Ricky Gervais. Actress Busy Philipps wasted no time in suggesting she should host the ceremony instead. Failing that, she said, any female host would be preferable. The Oscars has been hosted by women before - such as Ellen DeGeneres and Anne Hathaway, who co-anchored with James Franco. Other suggestions put forward on social media included Daily Show host Trevor Noah, RuPaul, Justin Timberlake, and Tiffany Haddish and Maya Rudolph. But potential new hosts may be reluctant to take on the job.  The role has thrown up problems for a number of past hosts and the Hollywood Reporter has called it ""the least wanted job in Hollywood"". This latest controversy comes after a difficult few years for the Academy that have seen Envelopegate, the OscarsSoWhite campaign and the scrapping of a proposed popular film award category. The Oscars will take place in Los Angeles on 24 February 2019. Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

Hawkish,Israel election: Who are the key candidates?,2024-09-25,2015-03-14,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-31815481,"The election is proving a closely-fought contest, with polls showing no clear lead Israelis vote in the second snap election in two years on 17 March, and polls indicate that right-wing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party is facing a serious challenge from the centre-left Zionist Union.  But Israel's proportional representation electoral system means that several other parties will enter the Knesset parliament, and the larger of them will be vital in deciding who forms the next government. Benjamin Netanyahu is a veteran of Israeli politics who has led Likud twice - in 1993-99, and since 2005.   He has been prime minister at the head of a series of coalitions of various colours since 2009, having served a previous term in 1996-99, and has also held several other senior ministerial posts.  He has a reputation for negotiating the volatile party system with skill, but his best efforts failed to maintain a stable parliamentary majority in the Knesset elected in 2013.  His broad coalition collapsed in late 2014, prompting the March elections, and for the first time in years he faces a real danger of losing office to an alliance of centre-left parties. Born in 1949 into a prominent right-wing political family, Mr Netanyahu spent part of his early life in the United States.  That is where he acquired the fluent English that made him a leading international spokesman for Israel in the 1980s, culminating in his appointment as ambassador to Washington. ""Bibi"", as he is known, has a strong following in Likud, based on his impressive electoral record and his hawkish stance on Iran and the question of a settlement with the Palestinians. But these qualities, combined with his forceful personality, nationalist rhetoric and association with economic liberalism, also make him a divisive figure little liked on the left. Just as Mr Netanyahu is a product of a conservative political family, so is Yitzhak Herzog a scion of a centre-left Labour Party dynasty. His father Chaim was president of Israel for 10 years, and his uncle Abba Eban was the country's high-profile foreign minister in the 1960s and early 1970s. He won the Labour Party leadership election in 2013, and is currently leader of the opposition in parliament and co-leader of the centre-left Zionist Union electoral alliance.  Born in 1960 and a lawyer by profession, Mr Herzog served in various middle-ranking ministerial positions between 2005 and 2011, when Labour left the Likud-led coalition.   ""Bougie"", as Mr Herzog is known, has continued Labour's traditional opposition to Likud's economic polices, accusing the government of depressing Israeli living standards, but has also campaigned aggressively against Mr Netanyahu's foreign policy and alleged neglect of the Palestinian issue.  He has highlighted the fact that he was a major in an elite military intelligence unit after Mr Netanyahu - a former special forces officer - accused him of being ""soft"" on security.  The Zionist Union - whose name was chosen to reinforce the alliance's nationalist credentials - has been running neck-and-neck with or slightly ahead of Likud in the most recent opinion polls.  Mr Herzog's co-leader in the Zionist Union is Tziporah ""Tzipi"" Livni.  Like Messrs Netanyahu and Herzog, she comes from a prominent political family - her father was a leading figure in the ultra-nationalist Irgun armed group during British rule before becoming a more moderate Likud member of the Knesset. Ms Livni, who was born in 1958, followed in his footsteps, moving steadily from the 'dovish' wing of Likud to her current position as leader of the liberal Hatnua party. She supported Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's policy of withdrawal from Gaza in 2005, following him out of Likud into the centrist Kadima party, serving as foreign minister before becoming party leader ahead of the 2009 election.  Although Kadima won the most seats, socially-liberal Ms Livni refused to accept the coalition terms demanded by Jewish religious parties and went into opposition.  She later lost the party leadership, and formed Hatnua in protest at what she saw as Kadima's move to the right.  She is a prominent advocate of seeking more cooperation with the Palestinian Authority and Israel's Arab community, and lost her job as Mr Netanyahu's justice minister in 2014 over a range of policy disagreements. She is one of the few mainstream Israeli leaders to speak out openly in favour of gay rights, and is well-regarded in European, US and, albeit mutedly, many Arab diplomatic circles for her record of pragmatism as foreign minister. Charismatic journalist and broadcaster Yair Lapid also has politics in the family, as his father and fellow-newsman Yosef ""Tommy"" Lapid led the firmly secular and relatively hawkish Shinui party from nowhere into government, then back into oblivion in the mid-2000s. Yair Lapid, born in 1963, formed a similar party - Yesh Atid - from scratch in 2012, and scored a striking success in the following year's election with 19 seats and the post of finance minister in Benjamin Netanyahu's government. Tense relations with his boss and poor ratings for his performance as minister plagued his time in office, which ended when Mr Netanyahu sacked him along with Ms Livni in 2014. But a vigorous election campaign, in which he has accused the prime minister of ""leading Israel into unnecessary elections"", looks like ensuring that Yesh Atid will have a smaller but still significant number of seats in the next Knesset and make life difficult for Mr Netanyahu. Moshe Kahlon, a former Likud welfare and communications minister under Benjamin Netanyahu, returned to politics as head of the new Kulanu party with a manifesto based on promoting social equality. Born in 1960 to Libyan immigrants, he won considerable popularity in office for freeing up the mobile phone market and championing cheap electricity, and stood down from Likud ahead of the 2013 elections. Founded at the end of 2014, Kulanu focuses on depressed living standards and has reaped impressive poll ratings. But it remains an unpredictable player in terms of coalition-forming, as it seeks to appeal to overlapping and possibly contradictory constituencies in the socially-liberal and populist camps.    The real surprise of the election could be the rise of the predominantly Arab Joint List to third place in terms of Knesset representation. List leader Ayman Odeh is also head of Hadash, a radical socialist party, and brought together three other Arab nationalist and Islamist parties in a marriage of convenience to boost Arab turnout and block Mr Netanyahu's return to office. Born in 1974, the lawyer from Haifa raised his profile dramatically with an impressive performance in a prime-time TV debate in February.  The Joint List would not take posts in a government, out of consideration for Palestinians living under Israeli occupation, but would be likely to support a Zionist-Union government. The religious party Jewish Home looks set to keep something like its 12 Knesset seats. Its leader, Naftali Bennett, is a charismatic and eloquent software entrepreneur who balances economic liberalism with a pro-settler stance, and has largely pushed aside the more secular Yisrael Beitenu of Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman. Born in 1972 to US immigrants, Mr Bennett is the outgoing minister of the economy.  Like many politicians competing for the same right-wing constituency as Benjamin Netanyahu, Mr Bennett objects to the prime minister's political pragmatism and even accuses him of planning a coalition with the Zionist Union.  But in the next Knesset he, like Mr Lieberman, would almost certainly join any Likud-led government.

Hawkish,Stephen Hawking remembered online,2024-09-25,2018-03-14,By George Pierpoint,https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-43397847,"Millions of people across the globe have flooded social media with tributes and illustrations expressing their sadness at the death of the renowned physicist Professor Stephen Hawking. Many artworks posted in honour of the professor focus on his iconic mobility chair. One such image which has been widely shared depicts the famous chair with an array of glowing stars emanating from the seat.  The picture was originally posted by news website Pictoline with the caption, ""Goodbye, Stephen Hawking"".  A minimalist portrayal of the professor's chair was posted on Instagram by Barcelona-based designer Eh'ctor.  Venezuelan designer, Oriana Estefania posted an image of Professor Hawking flying towards a black hole with the caption, ""Free, heading to your paradise... the universe"". The official Twitter account of the Clangers also shared an image of the children's TV characters looking up at the stars along with one of Professor Hawking's widely shared quotes.  Alana Neimanis in London, posted a video of her eight-year-old son Samuel reacting to the news of Professor Hawking's death.  In the video, he explains that he will ""forever miss"" the professor, and thanks him for his contribution to science.  Alana told BBC News that Professor Hawking inspired her son to develop a real love for physics.  ""Samuel often plays in the kitchen filling the sink with water and washing up to let the foam drain to see how it emulates the force of a black hole."" Samuel has Autism Spectrum Disorder, and sometimes finds it hard to understand why his friends are not as interested he is in the laws of physics.  Alana also reflected that Samuel has been inspired by the way Professor Hawking overcame the barriers of his disability to lead a ""very successful"" life.  Twitter account, Curious_Squirrel, which regularly shares light-hearted content about squirrels, posted an illustration depicting a squirrel observing the universe.  The tweet reads that Professor Hawking was such a skilled scientific communicator, he could teach ""even a squirrel"" about the universe.  Many online have been discussing the significance of the date of Professor Hawking's death, using the hashtag #PiDay. The date, 14 March, is marked as 'Pi Day' by some on social media in reference to the first three digits of the date, 3.14 - when written in the US-style - mirroring the first three digits of the mathematical constant pi.  Astrophysicist John Moffitt commented on the aptness of Professor Hawking's date of death, and pointed out that the date is also the birthday of Albert Einstein. "

Hawkish,Vodafone Three deal to create UK's largest mobile firm,2024-09-25,2023-06-14,By Tom Espiner & Vishala Sri-Pathma ,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-65842845,"A deal to create the UK's biggest mobile phone operator has been struck by Vodafone and the owner of Three UK. The firms plan to merge their UK-based operations, giving them around 27 million customers and making it the biggest mobile network in the UK. The deal is yet to be approved by regulators, which will look at whether it will push up customer prices. The Vodafone and Three merger will take their combined market share past Virgin Media O2's. Virgin Media O2 has around 24 million mobile customers while EE, which is owned by BT Group, has 20 million users. Vodafone and Three UK are the country's third and fourth largest mobile firms. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) confirmed that it will examine the merger. The competition watchdog said: ""Both Vodafone and Three are key players in the UK communications market - with millions of consumers and many businesses relying on their services - so it's right that the CMA reviews the impact this deal could have on competition."" Vodafone's UK boss, Ahmed Essam, who will retain his role in the merged firm, said: ""As we go into the coming weeks, we are going to bring the case to the CMA. We believe that this case stands on very strong grounds. ""We're very confident on our case."" Vodafone will own 51% of the new business while Three UK-owner CK Hutchison will control the remaining stake. Vodafone and Three claimed customers ""will enjoy a better network experience with greater coverage and reliability at no extra cost"" from day one. They also said they would invest £11bn in the next generation of telecoms technology - 5G - in the UK over 10 years. Consumer group Which? said reducing the number of major UK telecoms firms from four to three ""risks reducing the choices available to consumers, raising prices and lowering the quality of services available"". But Karen Egan, head of mobile at research firm Enders Analysis, said similar deals in other countries had not led to price hikes.  ""Consumers benefit from effectively funding just three nationwide networks rather than four,"" she said.  She added that the companies were ""making a strong case"" for approval of the deal, although getting there would be ""a long and tortuous road"" and could take up to 18 months. Ms Egan added that the ""CMA's hawkish approach to mergers of late is not encouraging"", after the competition watchdog blocked UK approval for Microsoft's proposed $69bn takeover of Call of Duty-owner Activision Blizzard. In 2016, EU regulators blocked a takeover of O2 by the owner of Three, saying it would reduce customer choice and raise prices.  Vodafone and CK Hutchison confirmed UK merger talks last October. Margherita Della Valle, chief executive and chief financial officer of Vodafone, admitted in May that its ""performance has not been good enough"" and set out plans to cut 11,000 jobs. On Wednesday, Vodafone and Three hinted at additional job cuts within five years if the merger is approved. They said that they expected consolidation of IT, marketing, sales, distribution and logistics operations. The Unite union said that the deal was ""reckless"" and would ""hike people's bills and mean job losses for Vodafone and Three workers""."

David Clarke, 48, from Harrold, Bedfordshire, found the undeveloped film in a Kodak Instamatic camera. A Facebook appeal led him to John Salter, 82, who had taken the photos of his wife Barbara and son Ashley, both of whom have since died. Mr Salter said seeing the images was a ""joyful experience."" Professional photographer Mr Clarke collects old cameras, a hobby he has passed to his daughter Taya, 16. She bought the camera from the nearby Emmaus Village Carlton.  When he discovered it still had film in it, he thought ""it would be nice"" to get it developed.  In a bid to trace their original owner, he posted the pictures on social media and heard from Simon Liddle, a former friend from Rushden Boys' School in Rushden, Northamptonshire. Mr Liddle recognised himself in one of the photos, along with his brother Gary, mum Rose and father Bill, and his uncle John, aunt Barbara and cousin Ashley Salter.  ""It was a nice shock to see them,"" he said.  He then connected with his old friend on Facebook.  Mr Clarke said: ""It was really nice to be put in touch with people you have forgotten about. ""There's a family out there that have now got pictures that they were missing.""  Mr Salter, 82, from Bedford, but now living in Lavendon, Buckinghamshire, said he donated the camera to the charity as he was having a clear-out.

Hawkish,Fans investigate #WhoBitBeyonce,2024-09-25,2018-03-27,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-43552605,"Beyonce fans are turning into amateur detectives after learning that she was apparently bitten on the face at a party. Actress Tiffany Haddish revealed details about the bizarre incident in an interview with GQ, but left the culprit unnamed. Two actresses have already had to deny being guilty following media speculation. Now fans are using #WhoBitBeyonce to track down the person responsible. Tiffany, who stars in Girls Trip, said she met Beyonce at a party in December last year. ""There was this actress there that's just, like, doing the mostest,"" she told GQ. ""She bit Beyonce in the face... So Beyonce stormed away, went up to Jay Z, and was like, 'Jay! Come here!' - and snatched him. ""They went to the back of the room. I was like, 'What just happened?'"" Beyonce's representatives told GQ they don't know anything about the incident with the actress, who Tiffany has not named. But that hasn't stopped the Beyhive from speculating wildly.  And celebrities have been wading in on the action too. Model Chrissy Teigen says she has her suspicions. Which led to a real rollercoaster ride.  Eventually, it appears, she discovered who it was.  The party took place after a Jay Z show on 22 December in Inglewood, California, according to Tiffany.  That bit of information led to The Cut drawing up a shortlist of potential suspects based on who they say was there.  Rihanna, James Franco, French Montana and Diddy were all supposedly there - and were all written off as innocent by the magazine. Tiffany said the culprit was an actress, leading to former 90210 star Sara Foster being mentioned.  Sara made it pretty clear it wasn't her.  Meanwhile Sanaa Lathan, star of Love & Basketball, has been the victim of bee emoji attacks - with the Beyhive posting them all over her Instagram.  She too says she's not the biter.  It looks like the speculation will continue. But in the meantime fans are having lots of fun with the memes. Beyonce and Jay Z recently announced their On The Run II tour, which comes to the UK later this year.  Follow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.

Hawkish,Why Merkel may help fund Europe's virus recovery,2024-09-25,2020-05-27,By Jenny Hill,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-52807748,"Last year, in the sumptuous setting of Aachen's historic town hall, Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron signed a treaty. The leaders promised to co-operate more closely and to re-fire the political and economic heart of the EU, sealing the deal with a kiss for the cameras.  How times have changed.  Their attempts to jointly reform, reinvigorate and reinforce the EU against the deep currents of populism and the shock of the UK's departure have, thus far, not amounted to much; the German chancellor apparently reluctant to lend her weight to the French president's imagined agenda for Europe.  But last week they announced another Franco-German plan. There could be no public display of affection this time as, via separate video links, the leaders unveiled their economic recovery proposal for a corona-ravaged Europe. The EU Commission, they said, should borrow €500bn ($545bn; £448bn) from the financial markets to fund the venture.   Unable to stand physically shoulder to shoulder, Mr Macron and Mrs Merkel had, nonetheless, thrashed out a compromise that took many analysts by surprise - not least because it represents a significant shift in position on the part of the German chancellor. The German leader has always resisted the mutualisation of EU debt.  The idea that richer member states should be responsible for the debts and defaults of poorer ones has not played well in Berlin, where the idea of ""coronabonds"", so vociferously demanded by a number of member states, had ministers spluttering into their coffee.  This proposal differs, but still centres on the sharing of debt.  The money, which will be doled out in the form of grants, will sit within - and be repaid out of - the EU budget, with each country shouldering the repayment proportionate to their existing contribution to the pot.  Germany as the biggest net contributor will therefore be liable to pay back more.  Not everyone is happy. Italy says the plan needs to be more ambitious, while four other countries, including Austria, want the aid to be in loans not grants. The head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, will put forward the EU's own proposals on how the recovery fund and a revamped budget might work on Wednesday. Mrs Merkel's apparent change of heart is an indication of her alarm at where the EU might be headed, post-Brexit.  German politicians have been taken aback by the recent level of hostility coming out of Italy and they are spooked by the prospect of populists in Southern European states making gains on the back of the coronavirus crisis.  It was no accident that Mr Macron talked about learning the lessons of the financial crisis when he said Europe's response exacerbated inequality and damaged European sovereignty. Mrs Merkel, edging towards the end of her final term next year, is looking to legacy and has made clear in recent speeches that she's focused on getting the bloc into shape.  Some say that a recent ruling of Germany's constitutional court may have spurred her on. The court has called into question the future of a huge European Central Bank bond-buying stimulus programme. She's also striking while the political iron is hot at home. Her handling of the pandemic has sent her own approval ratings soaring along with those of her party.   And, as Mrs Merkel is fond of repeating, ""Germany only prospers when the EU prospers."" The Franco-German proposal has gone down well with the domestic audience. Public surveys suggest Germans have warmed to the idea.  It helps that, as the Berlin-based German Institute for Economic Research has noted in interviews, Germany wouldn't be directly responsible were another state to go bankrupt, and that this plan does not represent joint liability. There's been remarkably little bite-back politically, with even her hawkish former Finance Minister, Wolfgang Schäuble reportedly giving the plan the thumbs-up.  Coronavirus has changed a great deal here, with politicians recently agreeing to abandon a long-cherished principle of not taking on new debt in order to finance a domestic economic rescue package.  Not that the fully developed plans won't be closely scrutinised. Katja Leikert, the deputy chair of Mrs Merkel's CDU-CSU parliamentary group, welcomed the initiative as ""a significant political gesture to help rebuild political trust on the future of Europe"". But crucially, given that the money would be disbursed as grants to regions and industries deemed to be most affected by the crisis, Ms Leikert says that ""conditionality will also be very important"". She says, for example, that the fund should be used to ""enable future investments... in digitalisation or transformation to a sustainable economy"". And while she notes that among voters she finds ""huge support for European solutions in the time of the crisis"", Ms Leikert adds that this is limited and says ""we have to make sure that increased public spending on the European level will create a European added value"". Europe's so-called ""frugal four"" continue to object to the plan, concerned that it might set a future precedent.  The leaders of Austria, Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands may have heard Mrs Merkel say this was a one-off instrument for extraordinary times but, publicly at least, they don't believe her.  They'll be under huge pressure to fall in, now that the bloc's two weightiest members have agreed on a plan that co-ordinates beautifully - some would say suspiciously so - with the wishes of Ursula von der Leyen.  It was no accident that, before Covid-19's deathly advance across the medieval courtyards and traffic-clogged avenues of Europe, Mrs Merkel and Mr Macron chose to hold that summit in Aachen.  Nearby, in its cathedral, lie the remains of Charlemagne, the warrior king who first united - not always diplomatically - much of what we recognise as Europe today. Having been apparently content to simply invoke an ancient ghost last year, it could be that finally France and Germany are together ready for action."
Hawkish,Federal Reserve takes tougher stance on inflation,2024-09-25,2021-12-15,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-59671577,"The Federal Reserve will cut back its stimulus programme more quickly than planned, as it ratchets up its response to rising inflation. The US central bank had already announced it was tapering off the monthly support, introduced to bolster the economy during the pandemic. But on Wednesday officials said the process would be speeded up, suggesting the stimulus will end by March. The move opens the door to interest rate rises in 2022. The Federal Reserve's so-called ""dot plot"" graphic of projected interest rate rises shows that the majority of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee expect three increases next year. ""Economic activity is on track to expand at a robust pace this year, reflecting progress on vaccinations and the reopening of the economy,"" said Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell. ""In my view, we are making rapid progress toward maximum employment,"" he said. Demand remained ""very strong"", although the arrival of the Omicron variant posed a risk to the recovery, he added. Officials forecast that inflation will run higher next year than they had previously projected and that unemployment, the other measure targeted by the Federal Reserve, would fall to 3.5%. As a result they forecast that benchmark interest rates would need to rise from current near-zero levels to 0.9% by the end of 2022. Analysis: North America Business Correspondent, Samira Hussain All year long, the Federal Reserve has been advocating a ""patient"" approach to winding down its support of the economy.  But faced with inflation at an almost 40-year high, the committee basically said, right we need to get on with it FAST. It's a particularly hawkish tone by the normally ""wait and see"" Fed.  For several months, the Central Bank had been calling inflation ""transitory."" That word has been put to pasture.  Americans are struggling to meet the cost of basics like food and housing because of skyrocketing prices. But this is an indication that the Fed is also spooked by the dramatic rise in inflation and concerned about just how long it will stick around.  The Federal Reserve began winding down its $120bn-a-month bond-buying programme in November, saying it would reduce the stimulus by $15bn a month.  But November's inflation data, showing prices rising at a pace not seen since 1982, increased pressure on the central bank policy-makers to take further action.  The stimulus will now be reduced by $30bn a month starting in January. ""The Fed apparently just woke up to the inflationary pressures consuming the US economy. With [Consumer Price Inflation] in touching distance of 7%, it should be of no surprise to see the Fed accelerating tapering,"" said Seema Shah, Chief Strategist at Principal Global Investors. ""Price pressures may well ease next year, but inflation will settle at a level uncomfortably high for the Fed,"" she added.  ""The big question for markets now is: can the US economy digest this pace of [interest rate] hikes without ending up with a stomach ache?"" The new Omicron coronavirus variant has added uncertainty over the future path of the economy.  However the Federal Reserve said it expected economic growth to be 4% next year, higher than the 3.8% projected in September. Diane Swonk, economist at Grant Thornton, said Mr Powell had chosen his words carefully reflecting that ""this is a booming economy in which inflation has been more persistent"" but that there had also been ""extraordinary progress towards full employment"". His language around employment had been ""very bullish"" she said, ""justifying rate hikes sooner rather than later""."
Hawkish,Oscars condemns Will Smith slap and launches review,2024-09-25,2022-03-28,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-60908869,"The Oscars film academy has condemned Will Smith for slapping Chris Rock at Sunday's ceremony, and has launched a formal review of the incident. A statement said it would ""explore further action and consequences"" in accordance with California law, and the body's standards of conduct.  Smith slapped Rock in the face on stage after the comic made a joke about the actor's wife, Jada Pinkett Smith. Moments later Smith won his first ever Oscar - for best actor in King Richard. Rock took aim at Pinkett Smith's shaved head, a result of the hair-loss condition alopecia. The incident cast a pall on what should have been Hollywood's biggest celebration and overshadowed others' achievements, one member of the Academy of Motion Pictures, Arts and Sciences - which organises the Oscars ceremony - told the BBC. ""I woke up so bummed out about what Will Smith did,"" said the member. ""To me, he stole the limelight. I don't think that was the place to be so violent. Most people were shocked. There were children there. It was a place to celebrate."" She asked not to be named. Monday's statement from the organisation behind the Oscars said: ""The Academy condemns the actions of Mr Smith at last night's show. We have officially started a formal review around the incident and will explore further action and consequences in accordance with our Bylaws, Standards of Conduct and California law."" Shortly after Sunday night's incident, Smith was seen apparently being comforted by actors Denzel Washington and Tyler Perry. Actor and comedian Tiffany Haddish, who co-starred with Jada Pinkett Smith in the 2017 comedy Girls Trip, described the exchange to People magazine as ""the most beautiful thing I've ever seen"". She said Smith had stood up for his wife. However, many said Smith was wrong to use violence.  Marshall Herskovitz, a film producer, tweeted early on Monday morning: ""I call upon the Academy, of which I am a member, to take disciplinary action against Will Smith. He disgraced our entire community tonight."" Roger Ross Williams, a black member of the Academy's board of governors, told the Hollywood Reporter that the confrontation drove him to tears because ""it reinforces stereotypes about black people and it just hurts me to my core"". Actor Wendell Pierce, whose credits include HBO's The Wire and Treme, said he was hoping for ""a public act of contrition"" from Smith.  But he pointed out that Rock once produced a documentary on how black hairstyles are tied to identity. ""That film showed an appreciation for Jada's, and Black women's, struggle with the disease of alopecia. The joke did not. It insulted and provoked,"" he wrote on Twitter. On social media, some users suggested Smith's actions could have violated the Academy's code of conduct and wondered whether Smith would be asked to return his award for Best Actor, which he collected onstage shortly after slapping Rock. The code states the Academy is ""categorically opposed to any form of abuse, harassment or discrimination"", including members acting ""in a manner that violates standards of decency"". It also reserves the right for the Academy board to suspend or expel those in violation of the code. However, Hollywood insiders like actor Whoopi Goldberg have said it is unlikely Smith will lose his award. ""We're not going to take that Oscar from him,"" she predicted. ""There will be consequences I'm sure, but I don't think that's what they're going to do."" Smith earned the award - his first - for his portrayal of Richard Williams, the father of tennis legends Venus and Serena Williams, in the film King Richard.  In a tearful acceptance speech, he apologised to his fellow nominees - but not to Rock - and said ""love will make you do crazy things"".  His wife has previously described hair loss due to her autoimmune disease as ""terrifying"". She looked unamused when Rock quipped to her: ""Jada, can't wait for GI Jane 2,"" in an apparent reference to her shaved head and a 1997 film in which the titular character sports a buzz cut. Moments later, Smith walked on stage and struck Rock before returning to his seat and shouting: ""Keep my wife's name out of your [expletive] mouth."" Comic Kathy Griffin said the slap sets a dangerous precedent. ""Now we all have to worry about who wants to be the next Will Smith in comedy clubs and theatres,"" she wrote. Rock declined to press charges and has not commented publicly about the slap. In the moments after the altercation, he quipped that it was probably ""the greatest night in the history of television"", before presenting the award for best documentary.

Hawkins, 15, knew a top-12 finish would realistically be enough for a medal, after a fourth and two third-place finishes on the penultimate day. Despite a difficult start, Hawkins fought back to finish third. ""This means so much to me,"" he said. ""I'm sure there'll be many more medals to come [for Team GB], but it's great to be the first [individual] medallist,"" the teenager from Cornwall told BBC Sport. Morgan soon claimed her silver medal with consistent performances throughout her all-around gymnastics event. The 15-year-old was sitting in fourth position after two of the four apparatus and finished with a total of 53.432 - just 0.634 points short of gold medallist Giorgia Villa of Italy, with Anastasiia Bachynska of Ukraine third.

Hawkish,County lines motorhome drugs gang sentenced,2024-09-25,2023-11-24,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-67519137,"Eighteen members of a drug gang that used a motorhome to target seaside towns in Devon and Cornwall have been handed a range of jail sentences of up to 12 years. Exeter Crown Court heard the gang supplied Class A drugs with an estimated street value of £1.38m. There were more than 30 drug county lines runs from Liverpool to the south west over 15 months to September 2022. Judge Anna Richardson said drugs had a ""devastating impact"" on society. She said the gang had exploited addicts in Devon and Cornwall, recruiting them through offering free drugs or pressure to pay off debts.  The dealers used the motorhome to tour the south west as they built up networks in Exmouth, Dawlish, Teignmouth, Torbay, Ilfracombe, Penzance, Camborne and Hayle, the trial heard. The conspiracy was based in Liverpool, and recruited couriers who made almost weekly trips to the west country. The trial heard they set up the first network in Exmouth in 2021, before moving on to Torbay and Cornwall. The operation was so successful its leaders were spending half their time in Ibiza by the time police closed it down in the autumn of 2022, the court heard.  The 20-month plot involved 21 men and women and 33 courier trips, which brought an estimated 8.8kg of heroin and 6.6kg of cocaine with a total value of £1.38m. Dealers stayed at Airbnbs, leisure parks and holiday camp sites, including one on the Lizard, the court was told. The leader of the conspiracy was 25-year-old Benjamin Burns, who made 15 trips to the south west, including several with his girlfriend. He bought a specially-adapted phone, which hid its true number and was intended to stop police identifying him. The next three most important gang members, the court heard, were Thomas Keating, his son Christy Keating and his cousin Georgie Keating, who all made frequent trips to Devon and Cornwall. Police involved in the sting, codenamed Operation Harbinger Two, traced more than 20,000 messages sent to users in which drugs were offered, the court heard.  Lawyers representing all the defendants said they were drawn into dealing by their youth, naivety, drug addiction, debt, or difficult personal circumstances. Over the course of the two-day sentencing hearing, 13 people were handed sentences who had previously admitted or were convicted by jurors of conspiracy to supply heroin and cocaine. They were: Also sentenced was Lee Paton, 34, of Liverpool, who pleaded guilty to possession with intent to supply amphetamine and heroin. He was sentenced to three years and 10 months. Maggie Burns, 21, of Prescot, and Dannielle Marshall, 27, of Orpington, both pleaded guilty to money laundering and assisting an organised criminal gang. Burns was sentenced to 12 months suspended for two years, with 20 rehabilitation days and 12 mental health treatment sessions. Marshall was sentenced to 18 months suspended for 24 months, with a curfew for four months between 19:00 and 07:00, and 20 rehabilitation days - including help with mental health. Joanna Buchanan, 49, of Shaldon, pleaded guilty to production of cannabis and assisting an OCG. Buchanan was sentenced to one year, suspended for 24 months, 100 hours of unpaid work at rate of one day a week, and 20 days of rehabilitation activity. Benjamin Hopkins, 46, of Shaldon, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply heroin, production and possession with intent to supply cannabis and possession of cocaine. He was sentenced to two years, suspended for 24 months, 300 hours of unpaid work, and a two-month curfew between 19:00 and 07:00. The final three members of the gang are set to be sentenced on Monday.  Follow BBC News South West on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram. Send your story ideas to spotlight@bbc.co.uk."
Hawkish,Museum's mammoth move 'a game of battleships',2024-09-25,2023-11-24,By Sophie Parker,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-wiltshire-67514517,"When it was announced that more than 300,000 objects would be moved by the Science Museum Group in west London to a storage unit near Swindon, it was described as the world's biggest house move. Now, more than two years later, the massive purpose-built warehouse in Wroughton is taking shape.  From trams, cars and missiles to a special kitchen sponge and rubber duck, homes have been found for the huge array of exhibits previously held in London.    About 300,000 objects and 30,000 metres of shelving are now inside the building at the Science Museum Group's National Collections Centre. The moving operation started a few years ago, with the last of the bigger objects being moved in at the moment. Head of collections management at the Science Museum Group Alexandra Fullerlove said that finding somewhere for each of the items has been ""like a giant game of battleships"". Every item has been catalogued, barcoded and put into place, with the vast majority also getting a professional photo shoot. There are 42,000 barcodes stuck on shelves, however many items are far too big to be on any shelves at all and stand in a massive grid on the warehouse floor. ""We are bringing in small and medium objects, but among them we're also bringing around 200 of some of our largest objects,"" Ms Fullerlove said. That includes an old tram from Glasgow, which is just under six metres (19ft) tall. ""The grid is divided up into 3.6m squares so we know where everything is,"" she added.  In a triumph of organisation skills, the grid is also colour, number and letter coded, so every steam engine, rocket, submarine and car can be found. The storage also has palette shelving six metres (19ft) tall. Big objects come in on lorries and have to be carefully taken off with a forklift truck, which is electric so there are no fumes in the building.  Lorries must have their wheels washed before they can go into the unloading bay. Staff think there are only around 30,000 objects left to go through the recording process. One intriguing item though is hard to understand unless you know the context: a used kitchen sponge. It sits on the shelving, amongst other carefully preserved cleaning products, but also signed photos and teacups. The difference between this and any other sponge is that it was once part of Prof Stephen Hawking's office. The Science Museum Group collection at Wroughton has its entire contents, sponge included. Staff working at the site explained a few of their other favourite pieces. The collections information project manager is Miriam Dafydd. Her favourite is a small rubber duck with some letters on.  ""[It is] just like the ones you might have in your own bath at home, but this one's got a special story to do with space,"" she said. An Open University team were trying to work out how to land a probe on a comet when the duck entered the plan. ""It turned out it was the exact same shape as a rubber duck,"" Ms Dafydd said. ""I'm pleased to say that in 2014, it did land successfully, with the use of the rubber duck in the planning."" Collections engagement and volunteering manager Alison Faraday showed off a few of the collection's robots, including trumpet player Harry and one that did stand-up comedy, officiated at weddings and knew Shakespeare. There was also a robot called Eric - a replica of one made in 1928 which would spit sparks, though his counterpart used LED lights. Ms Faraday loves the collection. ""All the time I feel joy and inspiration,"" she said. ""This is just such an amazing collection, showing how science and technology has evolved over many, many years."" While the storage is not a museum, the organisation is expecting to open it up for guided tours some time next year, with researchers able to come in earlier.

Hawkish,What Pompeo means for US foreign policy,2024-09-25,2018-03-14,By Joel Gunter,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-43398579,"Rex Tillerson never quite got his feet under the table at the State Department. In the 14 months he was in charge, he too often denied Donald Trump the absolute loyalty the president craves. In return, he was frequently and publicly undermined by Mr Trump, right up until his sacking-by-tweet on Tuesday. Mr Tillerson's brief tenure saw the department gutted by budget cuts and hamstrung by unfilled senior positions. The staff appeared to have little good to say about him. External reviews generally rated him somewhere between ineffectual and the worst secretary of state on record. But he was also seen as a bulwark against some of the president's more volatile foreign policy instincts, on Iran, North Korea, and Russia. Where Mr Trump sought to rip up treaties and trade agreements, Mr Tillerson appeared to favour stability and continuity. He will be replaced by the director of the CIA, Mike Pompeo, a hawkish, Trump loyalist whose foreign policy positions are much more closely aligned with the president's. Mr Pompeo's easy relationship with Mr Trump might boost the State Department's standing with the administration. It could also remove a key check on the White House. Here are four key foreign policy areas the appointment might most visibly play out. The president made it clear when he announced the change that his disagreement with Mr Tillerson over Iran was a factor. ""When you look at the Iran deal, I think it's terrible. I guess he thought it was OK,"" he said. ""With Mike, Mike Pompeo, we have a very similar thought process. I think it's going to go very well."" Mr Trump has railed against the Iran deal since 2015 and threatened throughout his early presidency to pull out. The Joint Comprehensive Programme of Action (JCPOA), as it is officially known, is an Obama-era deal between the US, UK, Russia, France, China, Germany and Iran, designed to limit Iran's nuclear programme in return for the lifting of sanctions. Mr Tillerson supported the deal and appeared to have some success warding the president off ripping it up, a move which would strain relations with the other powers involved, who insist the deal cannot be renegotiated. Representatives from the European nations have reportedly been meeting state department officials in recent weeks an attempt to protect the deal. That effort may now face an additional hurdle with the appointment of Mr Pompeo. As a congressman, he fiercely opposed the deal and he has been frequently critical of Iran. ""The notion that [Iran's] entry into the JCPOA would curtail Iranian adventurism, the terror threat or their malignant behaviour has proven to be fundamentally false,"" he said in October.  Mr Pompeo joins the state department just days after President Trump's surprise decision to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong-un for talks, a prospect experts agree the department, with key Korea positions unfilled, is fundamentally unprepared for. Mr Tillerson was a frequent advocate of improving diplomatic relations with North Korea, a position that won him scorn from Mr Trump. ""I told Rex Tillerson, our wonderful Secretary of State, that he is wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man"", the president tweeted in October, using a nickname for Mr Kim. Mr Pompeo has taken a much harder line on North Korea, suggesting at a security conference last year that he supported regime change and recommending during a recent Fox News appearance that the US make ""no concessions"" in negotiations with Pyongyang. If Mr Pompeo can bolster the state department's Korea expertise in short order, he may help take the US into a summit in a stronger position. But his hardline stance on Pyongyang could also scupper talks with a notoriously sensitive regime. If he steers the administration to abandoning the Iran deal before Mr Trump and Mr Kim even sit down, North Korea would arguably have even less reason to take the Americans in good faith. Mr Pompeo's loyalties to the president are perhaps most on show when it comes to Russia. As a Republican congressman, he crowed about the Democratic Party hack allegedly orchestrated by Russia. In a now-deleted tweet, he wrote: ""Need further proof that the fix was in from Pres. Obama on down? BUSTED: 19,252 Emails from DNC Leaked by WikiLeaks."" Mr Tillerson several times put himself at odds with Mr Trump by taking a harder line than the president on alleged Russian interference in the US election. By contrast, Mr Pompeo said in January there was a ""Washington-based focus on Russian interference. I want to make sure we broaden the conversation"". As CIA director, he said in October that US intelligence agencies had concluded that Russian interference did not affect the outcome of the 2016 US election - a remark the CIA later had to walk back, reasserting that the intelligence community had made no such determination. In the end, Mr Tillerson's stance on Russia may have been the final straw for him. Earlier this week, while the president conspicuously omitted to support the UK's conclusion that Russia probably directed an assassination attempt on its soil, Mr Tillerson asserted that the poison used ""clearly"" came from Russia and promised a response. Hours later, he was sacked. The appointment of Mr Pompeo may give Mr Trump a secretary of state prepared to take a softer line on alleged Russian interference in the election, but it does not remove the sharpest Russia thorn - Robert Mueller's special counsel investigation into alleged collusion.  Mr Trump's National Security Adviser HR McMaster and Secretary of Defence James Mattis are seen to have been counterweights to the president's more assertive foreign policy instincts, but both men are also rumoured to be on borrowed time, particularly Gen McMaster.  Mr Pompeo has shown a more aggressive streak. He has criticised Iranian and Russian expansionism, accusing both of meddling in Syria, and pushed back against Russia's actions in Ukraine. As CIA director, he presided over a major increase in CIA operations in Afghanistan.  His appointment, and a possible weakening of the positions of Gen McMaster and Mr Mattis, could shift the administration's policy on Syria, said analyst Charles Lister in a briefing note from the Middle East Institute.  ""Mike Pompeo's appointment as secretary of state is likely to embolden those within the Trump administration who seek to further amplify a more assertive posture within the Syrian crisis,"" he said."
Hawkish,Crewe Alexandra 1-2 Mansfield Town,2024-09-25,2022-09-24,BBC Sport,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/62937224,"Late goals from Will Swan and Oliver Hawkins saw Mansfield Town come from behind to snatch a dramatic win at Crewe Alexandra. Trailing to a Courtney Baker-Richardson strike, Nottingham Forest loanee Swan took a pass from fellow substitute Jason Law and struck into the bottom corner with a fine finish in the 87th minute. Hawkins then headed in the winner from Kieran Wallace's cross deep into stoppage time. After being on the backfoot to a dominant Mansfield for much of the game, Baker-Richardson produced a clinical finish in the 70th minute after being set up by Dan Agyei, who had earlier rapped the visitors' post. The Stags wasted chances in both halves, with Stephen Quinn blasting wide and full-back Stephen McLaughlin pulling a shot past the far post. Crewe keeper Arthur Okonkwo pushed around Hawkins' powerful header from a George Maris free-kick. Okonkwo produced another fine save when tipping over from Ollie Clarke after the Mansfield skipper chested down and hit a powerful half-volley in the second half. Crewe emerged from their shell with Agyei smacking an effort on to the post before setting up Baker-Richardson's goal. But the Stags were far from finished and their comeback win was their third success in the past four games and lifted Nigel Clough's side up to sixth in the table. Match report supplied by PA Media.

Hawkish,Israeli coalition government in crisis as MP quits,2024-09-25,2022-05-19,By Raffi Berg,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-61512656,"The future of Israel's government has been plunged into uncertainty after a member quit, leaving it as a minority in parliament for the first time. The Arab member of the coalition resigned, saying she could not tolerate its leaders' ""right-wing stances"" towards her section of society. The unexpected move means the coalition commands only 59 seats out of 120. The most diverse coalition in Israel's history has been in power for just under a year. Led by nationalist Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, it brought together eight parties from across the political spectrum, some with major ideological differences. Significantly, the government included an independent Arab party for the first time since the state was founded in 1948. Israel's Arab minority comprises about 20% of the population and although they have equal rights under the law, they often complain of discrimination. In a letter announcing her decision, Ghaida Rinawie Zoabi of the left-wing Meretz party, said: ""Again and again the heads of the coalition have taken hawkish, rigid and right-wing stances regarding basic issues of utmost importance for Arab society."" She said she had been swayed by recent events, including the funeral in Jerusalem of Al Jazeera reporter Sherine Abu Aqla, shot dead in the occupied West Bank last week while reporting on an Israeli operation, which saw troops in gun battles with Palestinian militants. At Abu Aqla's funeral last Friday, Israeli police beat and kicked mourners carrying her coffin aloft, causing it to almost fall to the ground. Police said they had acted after being ""exposed to violence by rioters"". The scenes, carried live on Al Jazeera, caused widespread outrage and scathing criticism of the police's actions. ""I cannot continue supporting the existence of a coalition that harasses my community in this disgraceful manner,"" Ms Zoabi wrote. Her departure puts the coalition in a precarious position. The government will now find it harder to function and would be vulnerable in the event of a no-confidence vote. Ms Zoabi is the second coalition member to resign within weeks, after a member of the prime minister's own right-wing Yamina party quit, saying the coalition was ""harming... the Jewish identity"" of the state. The coalition was formed in order to bring together enough parties to oust long-term Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu following a series on inconclusive elections. Mr Netanyahu has been leader of the opposition since then and has vowed to return to office."

Hawkish,Tom Holland and Letitia Wright join Oscars Academy,2024-09-25,2019-07-02,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-48836768,"Tom Holland, Letitia Wright, Adele, Lady Gaga and Winston Duke have been named among 842 new members added to the Oscars Academy. That's the group of people who decide who win Oscars each year. And after criticism of its lack of diversity, the new additions are 50% women and 29% are people of colour. You might remember #OscarsSoWhite being used in 2015 and 2016 in protest at the lack of actors of colour being nominated for top acting awards. The new additions are more inclusive and representative of the movie industry following this criticism. Overall female membership is now 32% - up from 25% in 2015. People of colour make up 16% of the Academy's membership now - double what it was four years ago. In 2016, people like Jada Pinkett Smith and director Spike Lee said they would boycott the Oscars when only white actors were nominated for the big awards. Chris Rock hosted the event, but there was pressure on him to step down due to the backlash. To address this, the people asked each year to join the voting panel since then has become more diverse. People like Riz Ahmed, Priyanka Chopra, Gal Gadot and Naomie Harris joined in 2017. And 2018 saw Jada Pinkett Smith, Tiffany Haddish, Amy Schumer, Daniel Kaluuya and Timothée Chalamet added. Other new names on the 2019 list include Captain Marvel and Crazy Rich Asians star Gemma Chan and British actress Claire Foy, who you may have seen in The Crown. Jamie Bell, Elisabeth Moss, Archie Panjabi and Amanda Peet have also been added. They've been selected from 59 countries from around the world. It's estimated there are now 10,000 voting members of the Oscars academy. Follow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.

Hawkish,A Nato summit for hawks,2024-09-25,2022-06-30,By Frank Gardner,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-62001165,"Historic, transformative, game-changing. Even before this year's Nato summit began, the epithets were rolling in. For this was the first such summit since Russia's fateful invasion of Ukraine on 24 February. Would differences bubble up to the surface? Would some countries push for an early ceasefire in Ukraine? Or would the alliance's more hawkish leaders get their way and see a new, robust posture towards Moscow with Nato's borders reinforced? Most important of all, would Turkey drop its opposition to two key democracies - Finland and Sweden - joining the alliance? That diplomatic breakthrough came early on with the two Nordic nations set to be fast-tracked to membership after their foreign ministers signed a security pact with Turkey. The Kremlin reacted with predictable indignation, branding Nato an aggressive, expansionist organisation with imperialistic ambitions. I asked Jens Stoltenberg, Nato's Secretary General, for his reaction. ""Finland and Sweden,"" he replied, ""are two sovereign democratic nations and they have the right to choose their own path. ""Russia doesn't respect the decisions of free nations and therefore it uses force to try to prevent them from doing what they want. That's one of the reasons why they have invaded Ukraine."" And what, I asked Stoltenberg, would he say to those who suggest that Nato is partly to blame for the war in Ukraine by ""provoking"" a paranoid Kremlin which claims it is being surrounded by a hostile Nato? ""This idea that Nato has some kind of responsibility for the [Ukraine] war is absolutely meaningless,"" retorted the Nato chief. ""Ukraine is a sovereign nation, they have made their decision. We are 30 allies, we have made our decision. None of that is an excuse to invade another country. ""The core of this matter is that President Putin doesn't like a free democratic successful nation on his borders. He therefore wants to re-establish some kind of sphere of influence. That's unacceptable and that's why our allies are providing unprecedented levels of support to Ukraine."" That support materialised into a billion-pound package of UK military aid, including drones and electronic warfare kit, bringing the UK's military assistance to Kyiv to £2.3bn. By midway through the summit the US had announced a package of reinforcements for Europe: two squadrons of F35 stealth bombers to be sent to Britain, two naval destroyers to Spain and thousands of troops to Romania. The UK followed suit, announcing a further 1,000 troops to be allocated for the defence of Estonia, a frontline state on Russia's border with one of its two aircraft carriers allocated - in a time of emergency - to a newly enlarged Nato rapid response force that's set to grow from 40,000 troops to over 300,000. The aim of all this, Nato ministers told me, was to build such a powerful deterrent that President Putin is dissuaded from launching any more land grabs in Europe. But what about an eventual peace deal? Will it ever be possible to make a deal with Russia that ends the war in Ukraine? That can only happen, said the UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, once Russia is pushed out of Ukraine and held accountable for its (alleged) war crimes. Interviewing her in the shadow of the towering, plate-glass skyscraper that houses the UK's embassy in Madrid, I asked her if she still believed that included making Russia give up Crimea, which it annexed in 2014. She wouldn't be drawn. But she said Nato needed to ensure that a Russian invasion of a sovereign nation could never be repeated.  Ms Truss was far from being the only ""hawk"" pushing for a robust stance towards Russia, and to a lesser degree China. In a sunlit Spanish garden in downtown Madrid I interviewed Estonia's Prime Minister Kaja Kallas. Could she, as a neighbour of Russia, I asked, trust in a future peace deal with Moscow? ""I think the West has been misled by Putin,"" she replied. ""He has lied a lot and has not kept the promises that he has given and therefore we shouldn't believe him any more. Plus the mistake that we have done is that the war crimes have not been punished."" If there were any dissenting voices among leaders at this summit, I didn't hear them. But once those leaders have returned home they may find more domestic problems taking priority. So not every ambition announced with such fanfare in Madrid may end up being fulfilled."
Hawkish,Foo Fighters review: A band working through grief,2024-09-25,2023-06-01,By Mark Savage,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-65769192,"For whatever reason, songs about male friendship and fraternal love are almost entirely absent from rock and pop music. Maybe it's a machismo thing - a fear of looking soft, an outdated model of manhood - but there are almost no male equivalents to songs like The Spice Girls' Wannabe, or Taylor Swift's I'm Only Me When I'm With You, written about her BFF Abigail Anderson Rock music, in particular, has always been more concerned with sex, love, status and power than camaraderie or platonic relationships. So when Dave Grohl sings about Taylor Hawkins on Foo Fighters' new album, But Here We Are, it hits you like a truck. ""I had a person I loved and, just like that, I was left to live without him."" Hawkins died suddenly in his hotel room last year at the age of 50, just hours before Foo Fighters were due to perform at a festival in Colombia. It was a devastating loss. Hawkins was more than just the band's drummer. He was Grohl's sidekick, confidante and brother in arms.  ""Upon first meeting, our bond was immediate and we grew closer with every day, every song, every note that we ever played together,"" the musician wrote in his 2021 memoir, The Storyteller.  ""We are absolutely meant to be and I am grateful that we found each other in this lifetime,"" he added, calling him, ""my brother from another mother, my best friend, a man from whom I would take a bullet"". Soon after Hawkins died, Grohl also lost his mother, Virginia - who had raised him as a single parent in Washington, DC, and allowed him to drop out of school to pursue music.  So it's no surprise that grief looms large over this album. Grohl describes himself as walking in circles, haunted by voices, waiting for storms to pass. Time is moving forward for everyone but him; and he's plagued by thoughts of his own mortality. ""I think I'm getting over it,"" he sings on Under You. ""But, there's no getting over it."" It all comes to a head on The Teacher, an epic, shape-shifting rock song that moves through all five stages of mourning in 10 minutes. Seemingly directed towards his mother, a public school teacher for most of her life, it is sombre and vulnerable one minute, and scorching with anger the next; with a dark, detuned guitar riff that threatens to choke the song's more uplifting chorus. ""You showed me how to breathe, but you never showed me how to say goodbye,"" Grohl laments, and the song grows in intensity, as though he's trying to build a tower to heaven. When he reaches the summit, there's a cathartic scream of ""goodbye"" before the music collapses in a bit-crushed fuzz of digital distortion. It's a stunning response to the pain of last year... As is the rest of the album, which hums with an intensity and focus that Foo Fighters' more recent outings have lacked. Musically, it's back to basics. Muscular chords and melodic riffs are the order of the day, as the band power through their sadness.  Under You has a fizzing pop melody that's among Grohl's finest. The title track is like drinking razor blades from a paper cup - all sawtooth guitars and primal scream vocals. Grohl sounds like he's disintegrating as he howls: ""I gave you my heart, but here we are"". By contrast, Show Me How is a tender, reflective duet with his daughter Violet. Over a gauzy twilight groove, they tentatively plan for the future, father and daughter offering equal reassurance to one another: ""I'll take care of everything from now on"". The gorgeous piano ballad Beyond Me also probes at the possibility of normal life resuming, even if Grohl can't contemplate what that would look like. ""You must release what you hold dear,"" he sings, ""or so I fear."" In black and white it might sound heavy-going, but there's an urgency to these 10 songs that balances out the pain. With their nerves burned raw, the band sound revitalised, defiantly alive, determined to honour Hawkins' spirit. Making their live return in Washington DC earlier this week, with veteran session drummer Josh Freese behind the kit, Grohl said as much. ""Getting up and playing shows again has been weird,"" he said. ""Not a day goes by where we don't think about him or talk about him. So this one's for T."" It's a reminder that, although the band continues, Hawkins will always be with them. And perhaps Grohl's honesty and vulnerability about his loss will inspire other writers to tackle the subject of male friendship.  It's notable that, when men do discuss those bonds, it's almost always too late: Diddy's I'll Be Missing You is a tear-stained tribute to the rapper Notorious B.I.G.; Pink Floyd's Wish You Were Here describes the loss of Syd Barrett to mental illness; Ed Sheeran's Eyes Closed is about the void Jamal Edwards' death left in his life. But with TV shows like Ted Lasso opening up the discussion about platonic love and brotherly affection, there could be a rich new lyrical seam for musicians to explore. For Hawkins, what a legacy that would be."

Hawkish,Science community mourns Stephen Hawking,2024-09-25,2018-03-14,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-43395479,"Tributes from around the scientific community are pouring in for prominent physicist Stephen Hawking, who died early on Wednesday aged 76.  The messages highlight his breakthrough research as well as his personality and inspiration to millions. One of the world's best-loved scientists, he was renowned for his work on black holes and relativity.  He wrote hugely popular science books, and even broke into a pop culture.  Suffering from a rare form of motor neurone disease he spent most of his life in a wheelchair and was largely unable to speak except through a voice synthesiser.  US TV scientist Neil DeGrasse Tyson said Hawking's death left a huge vacuum.   Caltech physicist John Preskill said Hawking's work inspired millions of young scientists to try and follow in his footsteps. ""I'll remember the sharp wit and twinkling eyes; he never took himself too seriously. His friends will miss him terribly,"" he wrote on Twitter. US space agency Nasa described the Briton as an ambassador of science, remembering his work with the astronauts on the international space station.  Accolades for Mr Hawking also came in from the tech community with Google CEO Sundar Pichai writing that the world had ""lost a beautiful mind and a brilliant scientist."" Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak told BBC News: ""Stephen Hawking's integrity and scientific dedication place him above pure brilliance.""  ""We lost a great one today,"" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said. ""Stephen Hawking will be remembered for his incredible contributions to science - making complex theories and concepts more accessible to the masses."" ""He'll also be remembered for his spirit and unbounded pursuit to gain a complete understanding of the universe, despite the obstacles he faced. May he rest peacefully as his legacy and brilliance live on."" Tim Berners-Lee, widely regarded as the inventor of the World Wide Web, tweeted the world had ""lost a colossal mind and a wonderful spirit"". US-Canadian theoretical physicist Lawrence Krauss described Mr Hawking as bravely fighting and taming the cosmos for 76 years.  Russian billionaire Yuri Milner, whose Breakthrough Foundation had won Hawking as a supporter for plans on interstellar travel, told the BBC that the physicist's contributions to science ""will not be forgotten"". ""When future historians consider who were the outstanding people of our age, they will think of Professor Hawking,"" he said in a statement to the BBC. ""As both scientist and human being, he was of the very highest stature."" Yangyang Cheng, a particle physicist at Cornell University, also highlighted the fact that the British physicist had inspired her when she grew up in China.  A similar notion was tweeted by James Davenport, an astrophysics post-doctoral student at Western Washington University.  Robert McNees, a physics professor at Loyola University Chicago, expressed the same feeling. ""I idolised Hawking when I was a kid. Once, when I was a post-doc, I got to hang out with him for an evening. Our group went for dinner and drinks, then karaoke. He was funny, lively, and kind. I called my parents at 3am to tell them. It was my 'I made it' moment."" Mr Hawking's unique fame far beyond the science community was highlighted by Caltech physicist Sean Carroll."
Hawkish,University seeks Stephen Hawking archivist,2024-09-25,2021-06-21,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-57526712,"Cambridge University is looking for an archivist to take on the ""challenging task"" of cataloguing 160 boxes of Prof Stephen Hawking's work. The University Library acquired the 10,000-page archive belonging to the world-renowned physicist last month. It will be the two-year job of a new archivist to catalogue the documents, enabling researchers to access them in the future. Prof Hawking, who lived and worked in Cambridge, died on 14 March 2018. The vast archive includes scientific papers, letters dating from 1944-2008 and his assistants' notebooks. There are also film and TV scripts - including for the Oscar-winning film The Theory of Everything, The Simpsons, and The X-Files. When Prof Hawking's archive was acquired, Prof Stephen J Toope, vice-chancellor of the university, said: ""His legacy lives on through this archive, which will inspire countless generations of young people with the same ambition as Stephen - to challenge our knowledge of, and help us understand our place in, the universe."" The new project archivist will create a catalogue which will be published online, with the contents later made available for research purposes. While ""substantial experience cataloguing archives to professional standards"" is an essential skill, it would be ""desirable"" for the successful candidate to have ""an interest and or/knowledge of post-war and contemporary science"", the job particulars state. Dr Katrina Dean, keeper of archives and modern manuscripts at the library, said: ""I don't doubt it's going to be a challenging task. ""One of the roles will be to try and understand the context of Prof Hawking's work - who he was working with, and when."" However, she added: ""We don't work in a vacuum. We work with colleagues and we have experts here within the university."" Prof Hawking's former office in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics at Cambridge University will also be preserved, and reconstructed at the Science Museum in London.

Hawkish,The Shape of Water leads Oscar nominations,2024-09-25,2018-01-23,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-42790624,"The nominations for the 90th Academy Awards have been announced, with The Shape of Water leading the field. Guillermo del Toro's fantasy romance received 13 nominations, including best picture. World War Two drama Dunkirk follows with eight nominations, while Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri received seven. British stars shortlisted include Gary Oldman, Sally Hawkins and a pair of Daniels - Day-Lewis and Kaluuya.  Greta Gerwig has landed a best director nomination for Lady Bird, one of nine films shortlisted for the best picture award. Others include Steven Spielberg's The Post, gay romance Call Me By Your Name and Winston Churchill drama Darkest Hour. Oldman's performance as Churchill has already won the British actor a Golden Globe and a Screen Actors Guild award. To win the Oscar, though, he will have to beat three-time best actor winner Sir Daniel Day-Lewis, nominated again for Phantom Thread. Meryl Streep's best actress nomination for newspaper drama The Post is her 17th for best actress and her 21st overall. The three-time Oscar winner said she was ""honoured beyond measure"" to be recognised for ""a film that stands in defence of press freedom and inclusion of women's voices in the movement of history"". Frances McDormand is tipped to be this year's winner for her role as a grieving mother in Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri. Two of McDormand's co-stars, Woody Harrelson and Sam Rockwell, go head to head in the best supporting actor category. The Shape of Water has also fared well in the acting categories, with nominations for Richard Jenkins and Octavia Spencer alongside Hawkins' best actress nod. Del Toro's film narrowly missed out on tying with the previous nomination record of 14, obtained by the films All About Eve, Titanic and La La Land. Diversity continues to be a hot topic in Hollywood, which has been rocked this year by sexual harassment scandals, concerns over gender pay equality and the role of women both in front of and behind the camera. These topics appear to have had an impact on this year's nominations, which are largely free of embarrassing exclusions and the kind of all-white line-ups that led to the #OscarsSoWhite campaign on social media. Greta Gerwig's nomination in the best director category will placate those who expressed displeasure at the Golden Globes' all-male directing nominees, even if she is only the fifth woman in history to be afforded that honour. And while there are no non-white performers up for best actress or best supporting actor, there are two black males up for best actor - Denzel Washington and Britain's Daniel Kaluuya - and another two shortlisted for best supporting actress. Jordan Peele's best director nomination for Get Out is also significant, given he is only the fifth black film-maker to be considered for the award. ""Right now I'm just thinking about everyone who bought a ticket and told someone else to,"" Peele tweeted in response to his film's four nominations. ""You did this."" Eight of this year's female acting contenders are aged over 40, while Christopher Plummer becomes the oldest man to be nominated for best supporting actor for All the Money in the World. Plummer, 88, took over the role of J Paul Getty in Sir Ridley Scott's film after the director decided to erase Kevin Spacey's performance as the US billionaire. At 89, meanwhile, Belgian director Agnes Varda - whose film Faces Places is up for best documentary feature - is believed to be the oldest Oscar nominee ever. Varda is a week older than fellow 89-year-old James Ivory, who has been nominated for writing Call Me By Your Name's screenplay. The Academy has recently strived to broaden the ethnic, age and gender make-up of its membership, which may have filtered through to this year's nominations. Yet the Academy still has a long way to go, as a comparison between male and female nominees in some of the key categories attests. Notable firsts include Rachel Morrison's best cinematography nomination for Mudbound, Netflix's drama about racial tension in Mississippi. Morrison, whose other credits include the forthcoming Black Panther, is the first woman ever to receive a nomination in this category. Mudbound's Mary J Blige also makes history by getting nominations for best supporting actress and best song in the same year. The nine-time Grammy winner co-wrote Mighty River for the film, which is also recognised for its adapted screenplay. Among those to miss out this year include James Franco, who had been tipped by some to get a best actor nod for The Disaster Artist. The US actor recently became the subject of sexual harassment allegations which may have hurt his chances of an Oscar nomination. London-born Martin McDonagh, Three Billboards' writer-director, is also a surprise omission from the best director line-up. Surprise nominees include Britain's Lesley Manville, up for playing Day-Lewis's sister in fashion-based period piece Phantom Thread. Paul Thomas Anderson's film, also up for best picture, best director and two other awards, did much better than many had expected. The nominations were announced in Los Angeles by British actor Andy Serkis and Girls Trip actress Tiffany Haddish.

Sue Dann, Lord Mayor of Plymouth, said: ""The King wanted this to be a community event, he celebrates volunteers and that's what we've been doing in the city."" In Exeter bell-ringers at the Cathedral attempted a new full bell peal lasting three and a half hours immediately after the Coronation service.  The Exeter Hindu Cultural Centre is marking the occasion with a Coronation Pooja including prayers from 18:00, followed by a children's presentation and a home cooked Indian meal. North Devon Council has invited people to stand within the letters it has mowed on Capstone Hill, for a photo opportunity on Sunday at midday.

Hawkish,Postcard from 1907 reveals address of suffragette,2024-09-25,2023-03-01,By Dan Martin,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-leicestershire-64803813,"A suffragette is to be commemorated on International Women's Day with a blue plaque on the house where she lived. The plaque will be placed on the former home of Alice Hawkins in Mantle Road, Leicester, on 8 March. Many suffragettes, including Ms Hawkins, refused to provide their addresses to census officials, but a postcard owned by her descendants gave the address. Her great-grandson Peter Barratt said it was a touching gesture. Mr Barratt worked with city councillors and Ismail Dale of Heritage Schools to get the plaque. Pupils from nearby primary and secondary schools will lead its unveiling.  The Hawkins family lived at the property in the early 1900s when Ms Hawkins was campaigning to secure the vote for women. The postcard was sent to her by Leeds suffragette Mary Gawthorpe on 11 June 1907 and provided valuable information on where Ms Hawkins lived. It allowed Mr Barratt and the councillors to confirm the address, with the records office identifying a location for the plaque. Mr Barratt said: ""To see a plaque unveiled on the very house where Alice and family, including our grandfather, lived over 100 years ago will be a very touching moment for myself and all her descendants who will be with me on the day."" The plaque not only commemorates Ms Hawkins, but many of the other local women who campaigned alongside her for equality at the ballot box. Ms Hawkins worked as a machinist at the Equity Shoe factory in Leicester and realised working conditions and pay for women were inferior compared to those of her male colleagues. She began campaigning for equality and joined the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU). After attending her first meeting in February 1907, she joined a march to the House of Commons and was jailed for the first of five times. She was one of several women charged down by mounted police and sent to Holloway prison. The suffragette campaign finally prompted the government to pass the 1918 Representation of the People Act, giving the vote to the first women - although not all women - in Britain. Ms Hawkins died in 1946, aged 83, and was buried in a pauper's grave. Fosse ward councillor Sue Waddington, who has been involved in the campaign, said: ""I am very pleased that the plaque to celebrate Alice's life will be a permanent reminder of her life in Fosse ward and her struggles for votes for women.""

Hawkish,Who is Senator John McCain?,2024-09-25,2017-07-20,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40666269,"A war hero, a political maverick, and one of President Trump's fiercest Republican critics - Senator John McCain, 81, has been granted all these titles over the years. Known in Washington for his doggedness and common-sense conservatism, he beat off younger rivals to secure the Republican party's nomination for president in 2008. As a US Navy pilot, Mr McCain narrowly escaped death in July 1967 when a missile exploded near his fuel tanks, sparking a ship fire that left 134 troops dead. Three months later he was shot down over Vietnam, where he spent five years as a prisoner of war. The son of a four-star admiral, he was offered early release due to his father's prominence - but rejected it. Instead, he endured repeated beatings and torture, including two years in solitary confinement. The six-term senator now faces another grave battle, after being diagnosed with brain cancer.  Mr McCain had surgery to remove a blood clot from near his left eye on 14 July, and was found to have an aggressive form of brain tumour known as glioblastoma.   Well-wishes from across the political divide saw four former presidents praise his tenacity, with President Trump sending his ""thoughts and prayers"", and Barack Obama - his rival for the presidency in 2008 - commenting, ""John McCain is an American hero... Cancer doesn't know what it's up against."" Mr McCain stayed in the armed forces after his return to the US, ultimately acting as naval liaison to the Senate until his retirement in 1981. It was at this point that he moved to Arizona to embark on a political career, winning a congressional seat in 1982 and securing a Senate seat four years later. Running against George W Bush for the 2000 presidential nomination, Mr McCain's direct style won him initial support and he secured a surprise victory in the New Hampshire primary. But he was hit by a number of attacks as campaigning turned increasingly negative, and later fell out with influential members of the so-called ""religious right"". The choice of Christian conservative Sarah Palin as running mate for his 2008 presidential campaign was designed to win over such Republicans.  Mr McCain has never been afraid to adopt a controversial position - especially since Donald Trump's emergence in politics. Though he has since hardened some of his views, he has previously attracted the ire of social conservatives for his relatively moderate views on civil unions, abortion and immigration reform. He was one of the Iraq war's strongest supporters, and backed the troop increase there known as the ""surge"". As chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee he has been a vocal - and hawkish - force in foreign policy and military affairs. While battling Mr Obama for the White House, Mr McCain stressed his own experience in these areas and argued that he would make a far better commander-in-chief. The Arizona Senator has repeatedly criticised President Trump's warming relations with Russia, and spent New Year's Eve 2016 with Ukrainian Marines. ""We stand w/them in their fight against #Putin's aggression,"" he tweeted then. Mr McCain withdrew his support for Mr Trump - then his party's presidential nominee - in October 2016, the day after a 2005 recording emerged of him making obscene remarks about women and appearing to trivialise sexual assault. ""When Mr Trump attacks women and demeans the women in our nation and in our society, that is a point where I just have to part company,"" he said. In July 2017, he told CBS's Face the Nation that Russian President Vladimir Putin ""got away with"" trying to change the result of the 2016 US presidential election. The Republican elder has repeatedly shown himself willing to work with Democrats or vote against his party on ideological grounds, including when he voted to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and against George W Bush's tax cuts.  He co-sponsored a bipartisan immigration bill in 2007 which, had it passed, would have offered an amnesty to illegal immigrants as well as tougher border controls. And he was the author, with Democrat Senator Russ Feingold, of a major campaign finance reform in 2002 intended to reduce the influence of money and pressure groups in US elections. He has criticised President Trump's refugee travel ban, saying it betrays American values and ""in some areas, will give Isis [Islamic State] some more propaganda"". When news broke of the president's confrontational first phone call with Australia's Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, Mr McCain phoned Australia's US ambassador, Joe Hockey, to express ""unwavering support"" for the countries' relationship.   In 2017, Mr McCain travelled to war-torn Syria to visit US forces deployed there. He called the Trump administration's decision not to prioritise ending the Syrian civil war ""another disgraceful chapter in American history"". As reports emerged of his cancer diagnosis in summer 2017, the senator's office said he was ""in good spirits as he continues to recover at home with his family"". But news a year later that he had discontinued medical treatment suggested the old granite-faced warrior had lost his last battle, and left the political world in mourning."
Hawkish,Storm-hit rail move 'destroying beautiful beach',2024-09-25,2019-10-13,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-50016322,"Plans to move a storm-hit coastal rail line on to a beach have been described as ""horrifying"" by residents. Network Rail has announced plans to move a mile-long stretch of the main railway away from crumbling cliffs. Campaigners claimed it would involve the destruction of more than half of Holcombe beach near Teignmouth, Devon.  Network Rail said the plans were the ""best possible solution"" to preserve the line that connected Devon and Cornwall to the rest of the country. The proposals have been part of a broader series of plans by Network Rail to safeguard the line. These included the expansion of the sea wall, which began at Dawlish in June, following a major collapse and destruction of the rail line in February 2014. That project was expected to be completed in January 2020 at a cost of £30m.  Ruth Ward from the Save Holcombe Beach campaign said there must be alternatives to destroying ""such a beautiful beach"". ""Surely in this day and age we know the sea is rising and moving it out to sea is going to make the problem from the sea worse,"" she added. In 2014 the storm damage cost the local economy £1bn as a result of the six-week closure of the line, according to a spokesman for Network Rail. ""Leaving it is not an option. Changing our plans to potentially re-grade the cliff would mean we would have to close the railway line. ""It would have a massive impact on the peninsula, all the way down through Devon and into Cornwall,"" he added. Network Rail said the plans were not final and further consultation would be held. If the project went ahead the building work would begin in 2022 and take up to six years."
Hawkish,Victory for Orban means a headache for the EU,2024-09-25,2022-04-04,By Katya Adler,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-60978909,"You could almost hear the collective thud of EU hearts sinking on Sunday night as Viktor Orban made his victory speech. ""Our win is so huge you can see it from the Moon, never mind from Brussels,"" he gloated pointedly.  A self-styled illiberal democrat, Hungary's prime minister has repeatedly clashed with Brussels over rule of law issues, like press freedom and migration.  They've fallen out over Moscow too.  That's why there was so much international attention on Hungary's election. Orban is famed for his warm relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin. He buys a lot of energy from Moscow. But so do many other EU countries. It's more the similarity critics see between the two men. Both, they say, are disdainful and dismissive of Brussels, of political opposition, of questioning media, of the LGBTQ+ community. Of course Orban is no Putin. Though an election billboard on Hungarian highways, sponsored by opposition parties, suggested as much.  Next to black-and-white photos of the two leaders facing one another, the caption summarised the choice allegedly facing voters: ""Hungarian Putin"" or Europe. Numerous populist, nationalist, or right-wing politicians with a penchant for strong man (or woman) politics, have admired Putin over the years - or sought to emulate some of his traits. Think Italy's Matteo Salvini, France's Marine Le Pen, the US's Donald Trump. But Orban is the leader of an EU and Nato member country, at a time when both are deeply at odds with Moscow over the invasion of Ukraine. ""I worry about our friend in Budapest,"" a foreign minister from a key EU power told me in a whisper, just before the Russian invasion. In fact, Hungary signed up to Western sanctions, which came thick and unexpectedly fast, via Brussels. But at the same time opponents back home complained Hungarian state media was churning out propaganda-like news, ""Russia-style"" about the war in Ukraine.  Opposition politicians made a formal complaint to the OSCE, the Organization for Security and Co-operation that monitors human rights and elections in early March. Most state and private media in Hungary have been taken over by Orban allies during his last 12 years in government. Loyalists head up key institutions across the country in business, academia, media and NGOs too. This system of patronage has given birth to an elite class of wealthy conservative cronies in Hungary. Critics call them Orban's oligarchs. ""There's been an orgy of disinformation over Ukraine,"" political commentator Peter Kreko told me. So much so, he said, that many Hungarians believe the war was triggered by Kyiv. The war ended up dominating the last weeks of the election campaign here. You'd have thought the Hungarian opposition would have had a field day exploiting Orban's known ties to Moscow. Instead, the well-oiled government PR machine slickly transformed him into Orban the peacemaker - allowing him to avoid directly antagonising Moscow. Ukraine borders Hungary, and around 400,000 refugees have fled here since Russia's forces invaded. But Orban said Hungary should keep out of the conflict itself - a war, he said, between two giant countries. Too dangerous, he insisted. He has refused to send weapons into Ukraine or to allow other countries to transit their arms destined for Ukraine through Hungary. He is the only EU leader to openly criticise Ukraine's president.  Orban's entourage accused Vlodymyr Zelensky of forming a ""pact"" with the Hungarian opposition to drag Hungarian soldiers into the war with Russia. It was striking this Sunday, that in addition to his supporters, the majority of anti-Orban voters I spoke to in polling stations were ambivalent about who was to blame for the bloodshed in Ukraine. A huge contrast to public opinion I've come across elsewhere in central and eastern Europe over the last month, in capitals awash with Ukrainian flags. Not a sight that greets you in Budapest. For years, Orban has prided himself on his ""political pragmatism"". An outspoken anti-communist after the fall of the Berlin Wall, he's now a nostalgic nationalist conservative. He dallies with allies east and west. Always pushing the boundaries. Just about getting away with it. But the war in Ukraine has changed things. It's thrown loyalties into sharp relief.  Orban's attitude towards Ukraine sits uncomfortably with EU and Nato allies. Hungary is becoming increasingly isolated.  Orban has even succeeded in alienating his closest EU ally. The similarly ""illiberal""-minded government in Poland.  Warsaw is one of the most hawkish Western powers when it comes to Russia. And right now it's furious with Viktor Orban. And yet, he is the longest-serving leader around the EU table. He knows how things work. Neither Nato nor the EU will want to ostracise him altogether. The West aims to present a united front when facing Vladimir Putin. With his fresh election victory, Viktor Orban will remain an unpredictable thorn in their side for some time to come."

The 5km (3.1 miles) route will run from near Kingsteignton to Teignmouth and be accessible to walkers, cyclists and mobility scooter and wheelchair users. The scheme will improve biodiversity, with the creation of hedgerows and woodland, the council has said. There will also be viewing points on the route, as reported by the Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS). The first section between Town Quay, Newton Abbot and Kingsteignton opened in March 2013, followed by the route eastwards linking Newton Abbot Racecourse to the Passage House Inn five years later. Councillor Stuart Hughes, cabinet member with responsibility for cycling, said delivering the Teign Estuary Trail had been an ambition of the council for many years. ""It is a project for which we've been able to attract significant local support,"" he said. ""A huge number of residents, cycle enthusiasts, walkers, business owners and visitors to the area have been flagging up significant need for the delivery of this route."" A public consultation ""demonstrated overwhelming support for the proposals from 92 per cent of respondents"" with the planning application receiving just one objection, he added. Teignbridge's member for planning, councillor Gary Taylor said: ""The trail will provide a very important green infrastructure link which I know will be warmly welcomed by our local public and by those visiting the area.""

Hawkish,Hawkins confident after opening win,2024-09-25,2013-04-22,Owen Phillips,https://www.bbc.com/sport/snooker/22251827,"Barry Hawkins says his confidence could not be any higher after cruising into ""the thick of the World Championship"" with a slick first-round display against qualifier Jack Lisowski. The Australian Open champion continued his impressive form this season with a 10-3 win over the Crucible debutant. ""I played really solid,"" the London-born cueman told BBC Sport. ""After the season I have had my confidence cannot be any better really."" Hawkins, who will be 34 on Tuesday, has played some of the most consistent snooker of his career this season and secured his first ranking event title with victory over Peter Ebdon in the final of the Australian Goldfields Open in Bendigo in June. Hawkins, up to 14 in the world rankings, said he felt relaxed and in an ideal place to make the most of his good form and calm mood. ""It has taken me a long time to get to this stage,"" he said. ""I have had a lot of setbacks in my career, but I have kept fighting, kept practising and working hard and I feel that now is the time to have a decent run here."" His prospects look encouraging after an emphatic victory over 21-year-old Lisowski. ""I was pleased with the way I performed throughout the match,"" said Hawkins, who will play Mark Selby or Matthew Selt in the second round.  ""I didn't finish off as well as I would have liked but I think I did the job early doors. ""I am delighted to still be in the tournament and in with a shout."" Hawkins, who is making his eighth successive appearance at the Crucible, has now reached the second round on his last three visits. ""The first match is always one of the toughest because you want to be really involved in the tournament,"" the Ditton resident said. ""Once you get through the first round, you are in the thick of it. Now I have got that out of the way I can settle down and try to treat it like any other tournament. ""Obviously it's the World Championship so it is always at the back of your mind; it's the biggest stage and you want to do really well. ""But I have been to a lot of venues and been to this place a lot of times so I know what to expect.""

Hawkish,'Snooker-mania' escape boosts Hawkins,2024-09-25,2015-04-23,Owen Phillips,https://www.bbc.com/sport/snooker/32431681,"Hawkins will face world number 12 Mark Allen in the last 16 at the Crucible on Friday World Championship Venue: Crucible Theatre, Sheffield Dates: 18 April-4 May Coverage: Watch live on BBC TV, HD, Red Button, Connected TV, online, tablets, mobiles and BBC Sport app. Full details here. Barry Hawkins says the picturesque serenity of the Derbyshire countryside has helped him relax and find his best form at the Crucible. The world number five was the 2013 runner-up and he proved it was no fluke by reaching the final four at last year's World Championship. And he told BBC Sport staying in a cottage a short drive away from Sheffield has helped him stay calm prior to another attempt at winning snooker's showpiece event. ""It is ideal really,"" said Hawkins, who needed to call on all his powers of relaxation as he saw a 9-4 lead slowly whittled away in his 10-9 first-round win over Matthew Selt. ""It's in the countryside, it has unbelievable views and on a lovely day it feels perfect - away from all the hustle and bustle of Sheffield and the snooker-mania. ""I get fed up with staying in hotels and if you are going to be here for a week or two you want to be as comfortable as possible. ""I stumbled across it a couple of years ago online and as long as I am playing at the Crucible I will always try to stay there."" The eagerly awaited tranquil trip was very nearly a mini-break this year, with Hawkins coming perilously close to wasting his money before finally shaking off Selt's comeback. Avoiding defeat in that match means Ronnie O'Sullivan remains the only man to have beaten Hawkins at the Crucible since 2012. Hawkins' appearance in the 2013 final against Ronnie O'Sullivan was the first time he had gone beyond round two at the Crucible since turning professional in 1996 But the run to the 2013 final, where he lost 18-12, and last year's 17-7 defeat in the last four mean that although the title still eludes him, Hawkins did at least get full value from his countryside retreat. And the Kent-based, London-born left-hander said this season's tough Sheffield opener may do him some good - as long as there is no repeat when he starts his second-round, three-session match against Mark Allen on Friday. ""It gives me a lot of confidence and shows I can do it under the utmost pressure,"" the 'Hawk' said. ""I just hope I just don't have to do it again. ""If you can get through the first couple of rounds playing really well and get through quite easy, and conserve some energy for the later rounds, then it is a massive advantage.  ""Last year I came through some really tough battles and when I played Ronnie in the semi-finals I was absolutely wiped out. ""I had nothing left in the tank whatsoever. It was the first time I have ever felt like that.  ""I went quite far behind and just wanted him to finish me off. I just couldn't wait to get out of there. It's mentally draining and not a nice feeling to have."" At least Hawkins had three full days off after Monday's nerve-jangling win over Selt. Barry Hawkins' recent record at the Crucible 2013 2014 Last 32: Beat Jack Lisowski 10-3 Last 32: Beat David Gilbert 10-4 Last 16: Beat Mark Selby 13-10 Last 16: Beat Ricky Walden 13-11 Quarter-final: Beat Ding Junhui 13-7 Quarter-final: Beat Dominic Dale 13-12 Semi-final: Beat Ricky Walden 17-14 Semi-final: Lost to Ronnie O'Sullivan 17-7 Final: Lost to Ronnie O'Sullivan 18-12 And the 36-year-old is guaranteed to be match sharp when he faces world number 12 Allen. He knows he needs to be, against one of the most attacking players on the circuit. ""It just gets tougher and tougher from now on,"" said Hawkins, who has only beaten the Northern Irishman once in nine previous meetings. That win was in their last encounter, a 5-1 success at the German Open in 2013. The only time they have played each other in a match longer than a first-to-five format came at the Crucible in 2011, Allen winning a thrilling encounter 13-12 with a break of 123 in the deciding frame. ""Mark is so gritty and determined and is a great player,"" the two-time ranking event winner said. ""If he gets going he bangs in big breaks all day long and he has a great all-round game. ""I will have to be at the top of my game to win. I am thoroughly looking forward to it; I like the way Mark plays and hopefully it will be free-flowing.""

Five-time champion Ronnie O'Sullivan celebrated his 42nd birthday with a 6-1 win over Welshman Michael White in the third round of the UK Championship. O'Sullivan was dominant early on, making a stunning 132 on his way to a 4-1 lead against the world number 26. An error-strewn sixth frame also went O'Sullivan's way and he closed out victory with a break of 65. World number eight Barry Hawkins was a shock last-32 loser against Thailand's Sunny Akani.

I wasn't brilliant but some people scramble better than others when they need to, and I was able to do that."" With 12 of the top 16 seeds having already lost in York - including the world's top three Mark Selby, Judd Trump and Ding Junhui - O'Sullivan's hopes are looking increasingly strong. O'Sullivan showed flashes of his fluent best early on, but his margin of victory was as much down to White's struggles as his own efforts. White, 26, said: ""I was absolutely awful. It's so frustrating. I didn't even play half-decent."" O'Sullivan added: ""You could see Michael struggling out there and the more you miss the harder it gets. I kind of felt for him. He's a good lad and he loves the game and it was frustrating for him. ""I want to play well and do well but if I don't, I don't care. I have other more important stuff to do."" Higgins, 42, held off a fine fightback by Chinese teenager Yan Bingtao to progress with a 6-3 victory. The Scot hit breaks of 66 and 80 as he moved 3-0 ahead, but Yan, 17, then responded with two-half centuries of his own to help bring him level. But Higgins' superior matchplay began to tell and two more 50s saw him over the line. Higgins, who plays Mark King in the next round following the Englishman's win over Luca Brecel, said: ""I competed well. My safety was good against a very talented player.

The world number four won the final eight frames in a 10-4 victory over qualifier David Gilbert to secure a last-16 meeting with Ricky Walden. ""I struggled early on and felt a bit all over the place,"" Hawkins, 35, said.  ""But I stuck with it, finished off strongly in the first session and played pretty well today."" He added: ""I was quite confident coming in today but knew I had to play well and I did that. ""I am delighted to get through and feel like I am in the tournament now."" Hawkins had never been beyond the second round in seven attempts at the Crucible until his run to the final last year, losing eventually to Ronnie O'Sullivan. And the London-born, Kent-based player said that helped him settle when his match against Gilbert was in the balance at 4-2 down. ""I was nervous and was struggling to settle,"" Hawkins admitted. ""But the longer you are out there the easier it is - and the experience last year helped. I tried to stay calm and managed to get my game together."" However, Hawkins said experience will never completely eradicate the edginess that comes from playing in snooker's showpiece event.  He added: ""I don't think you are human if you don't get butterflies going out there. There is so much that comes with this tournament. ""Everyone is desperate to do well in it. You just want to perform well and you put so much pressure on yourself, perhaps too much - instead of just going out there and playing. ""That's what I did at the start but I managed to relax and then started cueing a lot better."" Hawkins, who turned 35 on Wednesday, is now relishing the chance to play Walden in a repeat of last year's Crucible semi-final. ""I forgot it was my birthday,"" he said. ""It's a nice little present. ""This morning I got a few texts and opened my cards but I forgot all about it because of the match so I will go for a nice birthday meal, and celebrate a little bit.

The wall of the Ship Inn at Cockwood, near Dawlish, Devon, collapsed following heavy rain - people were in the building but no one was hurt. Heather Brown, one of the family partners who run the pub, said the situation was ""absolutely devastating"", and their landlords Punch Taverns had not listened to their calls for building improvements. A Punch Taverns spokesperson said the company was ""thankful that no one was hurt or injured"". The pub is made from cob, a traditional West Country building material, which is a mixture of mud and straw. Ms Brown said ""cob specialists predicted this would happen"". She said: ""Punch have dragged their heels and ignored our pleas to help and now our business is in ruin. ""It's heart-breaking - in an industry that is already driven into the ground with the cost of living... fingers crossed we can rebuild.""

Hawkish,Dozens of WW2 veterans sign history buff's rifle,2024-09-25,2023-11-06,By Katy Prickett,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-67301224,"A history enthusiast has spent two years getting forces veterans to sign a rifle as he records their World War Two stories.  Jay Hawkins, 26, was inspired after buying a 1939 Lee-Enfield weapon. The painter and decorator, from St Ives, Cambridgeshire, has traced about 90 RAF, Army and Royal Navy personnel and hopes to record at least 10 more. ""I can't comprehend what they went through, when most of them were just 17 or 18 years old,""  he said. ""People wouldn't have the lives they have today without them."" Since beginning the project he has travelled thousands of miles, meeting veterans in England, Scotland and Wales, with the closest living ""only 12 doors down"".  He uses social media forums to reach out to the children and grandchildren of the men and women, the youngest of whom was in their 90s, with the oldest aged 107.  They include Ken Hay, 97, who joined up aged 17 and ""stormed the beaches of Normandy"" in 1944 as a private in the Essex Regiment, only to be captured a few days later by the German 12th SS Panzer Division, while behind enemy lines. He was sent to Poland in a cattle truck, where he worked in a coal mine, but worse was to come.  ""During the final months of the war, he was force-marched 1,000 miles (1,600km) with thousands of prisoners of war, across Poland and Germany in appalling winter conditions, until the Americans liberated them on 20 April 1945,"" said Mr Hawkins.   Mr Hawkins said: ""Trying to find female veterans is really hard to do, but they had just as important role in World War Two."" Marie Scott, 96, who met him in Harwich, Essex, was also aged 17 during D-Day, when she was in the Wrens [Women's Royal Naval Service] working as a switchboard operator for the Supreme Headquarters of the Allied Expeditionary Forces (SHAEF).  ""Her responsibilities included passing messages from the continent to the leaders of Operation Overlord, including Eisenhower and Montgomery,"" said Mr Hawkins. ""She passed coded messages from troops during the D-Day landings and one of her most vivid memories is she could hear all the gunfire and screams through her headphones."" He said the ""most British story of all"" came from RAF veteran Joe Randall, 100, who now lives in Teignmouth, Devon. After the Normandy landings, he built temporary airfields and cleared the area of snipers.  Mr Hawkins said: ""He described a Spitfire crash, with the ammunition popping off and aviation fuel alight, and he said the bravest thing he did in the war was to run to the Spitfire and duck under and rip out a box. ""And what was in the box? It was a big box of tea so he and his friends could have a brew."" Mr Hawkins' World War Two interest was sparked by a visit to the Imperial War Museum at Duxford in Cambridgeshire aged about 12.  After hearing of a similar project in the US, he decided to ask veterans to sign the deactivated gun, and then he would upload their stories on Instagram as the Lee-Enfield Rifle Project. He hoped a museum would be interested in taking his collection of stories once he had finished the project.  Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X. Got a story?

Hawkish,City square to lose slave trader name,2024-09-25,2023-11-08,Jonathan Morris,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c292l62xr20o,"A Plymouth square that was named after a former mayor and slave trader is set to be renamed. The city council has proposed changing Sir John Hawkins Square to Justice Square. The square, between Higher Lane and Palace Street, was constructed and named in the 1980s when the next door magistrates' court was built. Anyone can appeal against the move by 29 November and magistrates will have the final say. The square was named after Elizabethan sailor Hawkins who is described in the Encyclopaedia Britannica as ""the first English slave trader"". The council decided to rename the square in 2020 following anti-racism protests during which a statue of slave trader Edward Colston was torn down in Bristol. Legal wrangles followed with a proposal to name the square after Jack Leslie, a black football pioneer who played for Plymouth Argyle. That was withdrawn after a road near Home Park, the stadium where Leslie made his name, was named in his honour. Councillor Chris Penberthy, cabinet member for housing and cooperative development, said: ""I'm very pleased to be able to finally move forward with the renaming of the square. ""We think that Justice Square is a fitting name for the area given its obvious proximity to the court but also as a homage to the positive role the justice system plays in our society."" The process of renaming the square has started and a notice will be displayed for 21 days. Anyone who wishes to appeal against the renaming can do so by contacting Plymouth Magistrates' Court by 16:00 GMT on 29 November 2023. If any appeals are lodged, the proposed renaming will be decided by magistrates.  Information about the role of Hawkins and others from the city who were involved in the slave trade is on a plaque in the square. Another plaque about the role of Hawkins' cousin Sir Francis Drake in the slave trade was placed on a statue of Drake on the Hoe. It followed pressure to remove the statue but the city council said at the time that ""rather than remove the statue we feel we have a duty to tell the full story of what he did and use this to help remember those who suffered as a result of the slave trade"".

Kenya's Geoffrey Kirui won gold with a season's best of 2:08:27.  Bahrain's Rose Chelimo won the women's race in 2:27:11, as two-time champion Kenya's Edna Kiplagat took silver.

There was also a British guy shouting at me, 'come on Aly Dixon' - he kept doing it. But apart from that, the crowd were great."" Earlier, Hawkins said he could have finished among the medals had he changed his tactics. ""It is bittersweet. I could just see third place in the distance,"" said Hawkins, who was ninth in the marathon at the 2016 Olympics in Rio. ""The last five kilometres, I kept the same distance, which was quite frustrating. Maybe I left it a bit late.

Hawkins' performance equalled that of fellow Briton Peter Whitehead, who was fourth in the 1995 World Championships in Gothenburg. Ethiopia's Tamirat Tola took silver in 2:09:49, two seconds in front of Tanzania's Alphonce Simbu.

I was really pleased until I managed to wear one,"" said the 25-year-old. ""I should've been in a position where I could have taken that on and won the race but that's the 400m hurdles for you.

In the men's 110m hurdles, Andrew Pozzi was the only Briton from three athletes to reach the semi-finals on Sunday evening as David Omoregie and David King failed to progress. Pozzi, who claimed the European Indoor 60m hurdles title in March, won his heat in 13.28 seconds in the same race as one of the main contenders, Jamaican Ronald Levy, failed to finish. ""I knew I got out very well so once I got to halfway it was about staying clean over the barriers and avoiding any big mistake,"" said Pozzi. ""Ronald is a big loss to the competition but I'm happy to make it through and make it to the semis tonight. ""I need a little bit faster to go into the final but I'm ready to do that.""

The Scot, 26, was running his first marathon since collapsing while leading the 2018 Commonwealth Games race. And Hawkins finished 10th in a new Scottish record time of two hours, eight minutes and 14 seconds. ""I was thinking 'not again' but I managed to get my head back up and focus,"" he told BBC Scotland. ""At the 40km mark, I looked down to grit my teeth and go but I had a bit of moment. Almost blackout, but I managed to get myself together."" Hawkins is now the third fastest Briton over 26 miles 385 yards, having eclipsed the Scottish record of Alistair Hutton, which stood for 34 years. ""I was hoping for two hours, seven minutes going in, but to take a minute off the Scottish record, I'm pretty pleased with that,"" he said. Looking back on his Commonwealth Games disappointment in Australia, he added: ""I had moved on from the Gold Coast towards the end of last year. I had all of my focus on London, but it's good to get it off my back. ""It's been a tough learning curve. It was completely different to being injured. If anything, you'd rather be injured because you'd know what was wrong. ""But I was patient and slowly made my way back."" Hawkins qualifies for the World Championships in Doha later this year, while his London time was inside the standard for the Tokyo Olympics in 2020. ""I need to keep putting in the miles, the big sessions, and make sure I pick the right races so I can secure that Olympic place,"" he said.

The race will be the Scot's first marathon since collapsing in exhaustion 2km from winning the Commonwealth Games title in Gold Coast last April. ""I don't want to be known as the guy who fell over on a bridge; I want to be known as the guy who wins medals and runs quick times,"" he told BBC Sport. ""I'll maybe have to prove that the Gold Coast hasn't done any damage."" Last year, in temperatures approaching 30C, the Scot was leading the Commonwealth Games marathon when he began to look unsteady on his feet. Falling once, he got back up and continued before a second fall moments later crossing a bridge just over a mile from the finish line ended his race and he was eventually taken to hospital for treatment.  ""It was almost like going into a car that had been sitting in the heat all day,"" recalled Hawkins.

But the 26 year-old feels he has learned from his experience in Australia. ""It's going to be a good learning curve for the Tokyo Olympics, if I make it, because it will probably be similar conditions there. ""I'll have a better plan and actually stick to it - which I didn't do in Gold Coast."" In the year since his disappointment in Gold Coast Hawkins has chosen to concentrate on training blocks and racing shorter distances. And he believes that training at altitude in Arizona and in the heat of Mallorca will prepare him to make a statement on his return at the London Marathon on 28 April. ""The aim is to run fast enough that people forget what happened in the Gold Coast,"" he said. ""Some people have had big 'catastrophes' like that and they've not been the same. ""My body is feeling good in training but it's just actually doing it in a race to say 'I'm back'. ""I've run personal bests at altitude in training and I'm aiming for a PB in London.

Hawkins, ninth in Rio, was narrowly beaten into second place on Saturday by the USA's Leonard Korir in the 8k race. Though he admitted afterwards that was ""bitter-sweet"", he knows the signs are growing ever more encouraging. ""Hopefully at the Worlds I can improve on what I did at the Olympics,"" the 24-year-old told BBC Scotland. Hawkins finished two places better off in Edinburgh compared to the 2016 event at Holyrood Park. ""Last year I used this as an opener, to start my season off when I was training for the London Marathon,"" he said. ""To be in a better place than I was then shows I can maybe even improve on this. ""This year the depth of the race, the standard, was a lot higher so to actually improve on my position from last year shows how much I've come on, how much of an improvement there's been."" In finishing second, he not only became the first Briton to beat Sir Mo Farah in any race in seven years, he also finished ahead of last year's winner, the American Garrett Heath. ""To be fair it's not Mo at his best because clearly he's in winter work at the moment, he's not 100%. But to beat Garrett Heath and even to be so close to Leonard Korir - he's a quality athlete,"" added the Scot, from Elderslie in Renfrewshire. Hawkins saw Leonard Korir pass him on the finishing sprint ""I was pretty disappointed when I got pipped at the line but I'm pleased just with the way the race went. I made it hard, did what I planned to do before. It's a bit bitter-sweet but that's racing."" Like most athletes of his pedigree, everything he does just now is geared towards one clear goal. ""The World Championships in August is my main aim,"" he continued. ""Hopefully I can go and do the New York half-marathon in March, that would be my next goal, and after that it'll be 100% on the World Championships. ""The crowd here were loud enough. I can't imagine what the crowds at the World Championships in London are going to be like. To have such a big event in your home country, in the capital, will be incredible.""

""I am really pleased; it was all I was hoping for,"" Muir, who ran her leg in around 2:52, 10 seconds faster than last year, told BBC Scotland. ""Having that role as captain, I just wanted to do well for the team, so I am glad I could do that and bring the team home."" After a three-week training stint in South Africa, next on Muir's agenda is setting another indoor record at 1000m next month, to add to the recent British indoor 5,000m and British 1500m records she already holds. ""I am hoping to run a really fast time at the Birmingham Indoor Grand Prix (on 18 February) and possibly get Kelly's British record over the 1K indoors (a time of 2:32.96, run in Birmingham 13 years ago).""  Beyond that, the 23-year-old confirmed the possibility of running both the 1500m and 5,000m at the World Championships. ""I am thinking about it, definitely,"" she added.

Hawkish,"Girl, 12, drums at Hawkins stadium memorial gig",2024-09-25,2022-09-05,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-suffolk-62793175,"A 12-year-old drummer said she had mixed emotions performing at Wembley Stadium as part of a memorial concert for Foo Fighters drummer Taylor Hawkins.  Nandi Bushell, from Ipswich, joined the band onstage and took Hawkins' place on the drum stool for Learn To Fly. Hawkins died earlier this year while the band were in South America.  Nandi said: ""It was amazing to play Wembley, but at the same time it was really sad."" She was one of many musicians to fill Hawkins' seat on Saturday in London, including Blink-182's Travis Barker, Foo Fighters' bandleader Dave Grohl and Hawkins' 16-year-old son, Shane. The young drummer, who goes to school in Ipswich, went viral after challenging Dave Grohl to a drum battle during lockdown. Grohl introduced her as ""one of the most badass drummers I've ever met in my life"". She met Hawkins last year, and performed the song at Wembley with a set of drumsticks he had given her.  Speaking on BBC Breakfast on Monday, she said: ""It was an incredible experience and so fun and exciting, but it was a tragedy that Taylor died because he was an amazing musician,"" she said. ""He was really warm and friendly and it's such a tragedy he died because he was just the nicest person.  ""It was so much fun. He was a role model ever since I was eight years old because I absolutely love the Foo Fighters. ""He was an amazing drummer."" Justin Hawkins from Lowestoft band The Darkness was at Wembley alongside Wolfgang Van Halen and Grohl to sing Van Halen's Hot For Teacher. And the frontman also joined Queen to sing Under Pressure, which featured Darkness drummer Rufus Taylor, who is the son of Queen drummer Roger Taylor. Eurovision runner-up Sam Ryder, from Maldon in Essex, also performed during the Queen section. He sang Somebody To Love - 30 years after George Michael sang it at the old Wembley for the 1992 Freddie Mercury tribute concert. Ryder praised the audience for their participation - writing ""when the crowd understands the assignment"" on an Instagram post. ""What a beautiful and moving celebration of such a wonderful human. Thank you for everything, Taylor,"" he wrote, ahead of announcing the release date for his debut album. Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

Hawkish,Israeli coalition government in crisis as MP quits,2024-09-25,2022-05-19,By Raffi Berg,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-61512656,"The future of Israel's government has been plunged into uncertainty after a member quit, leaving it as a minority in parliament for the first time. The Arab member of the coalition resigned, saying she could not tolerate its leaders' ""right-wing stances"" towards her section of society. The unexpected move means the coalition commands only 59 seats out of 120. The most diverse coalition in Israel's history has been in power for just under a year. Led by nationalist Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, it brought together eight parties from across the political spectrum, some with major ideological differences. Significantly, the government included an independent Arab party for the first time since the state was founded in 1948. Israel's Arab minority comprises about 20% of the population and although they have equal rights under the law, they often complain of discrimination. In a letter announcing her decision, Ghaida Rinawie Zoabi of the left-wing Meretz party, said: ""Again and again the heads of the coalition have taken hawkish, rigid and right-wing stances regarding basic issues of utmost importance for Arab society."" She said she had been swayed by recent events, including the funeral in Jerusalem of Al Jazeera reporter Sherine Abu Aqla, shot dead in the occupied West Bank last week while reporting on an Israeli operation, which saw troops in gun battles with Palestinian militants. At Abu Aqla's funeral last Friday, Israeli police beat and kicked mourners carrying her coffin aloft, causing it to almost fall to the ground. Police said they had acted after being ""exposed to violence by rioters"". The scenes, carried live on Al Jazeera, caused widespread outrage and scathing criticism of the police's actions. ""I cannot continue supporting the existence of a coalition that harasses my community in this disgraceful manner,"" Ms Zoabi wrote. Her departure puts the coalition in a precarious position. The government will now find it harder to function and would be vulnerable in the event of a no-confidence vote. Ms Zoabi is the second coalition member to resign within weeks, after a member of the prime minister's own right-wing Yamina party quit, saying the coalition was ""harming... the Jewish identity"" of the state. The coalition was formed in order to bring together enough parties to oust long-term Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu following a series on inconclusive elections. Mr Netanyahu has been leader of the opposition since then and has vowed to return to office."
Hawkish,Wonka film review: ‘Relentlessly wacky and over the top’,2024-09-25,2023-12-04,Nicholas Barber,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20231204-wonka-film-review-relentlessly-wacky-and-over-the-top,"Timothée Chalamet stars in a new prequel from the makers of Paddington 2 that explores Willy Wonka's early years. It's a seriously sweet treat that is 'straining at every sinew' to be the best possible family entertainment, writes Nicholas Barber. Not many of us have ever wondered about the backstory of Willy Wonka, the wizard-like confectioner from Roald Dahl's classic 1964 children's novel, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. But, the film industry being what it is, a big-screen prequel was as inevitable as Violet Beauregarde's decision to try the forbidden chewing gum. And so, just in time for Christmas, we have Wonka: an unfortunate title, but what else were they going to call it? More like this: -   Julia Roberts stars in a 'timely' and 'chilling' thriller -   Napoleon is 'an awe-inspiring achievement' -   Dream Scenario review: 'Nicolas Cage is on peak form' The good news is that the film is directed by Paul King, co-written by King and Simon Farnaby, and produced by David Heyman, ie, the team behind Paddington 2. Having made one of the best children's films of recent times – all right, one of the best films of recent times, children's or otherwise – they were granted the opportunity, and the budget, to do whatever they wanted with Willy Wonka, and they didn't hold back. The obvious route would have been to recount how Willy built his factory and persuaded the Oompa-Loompas to staff it, but King and Farnaby have veered off in a direction all of their own. In their hands, Wonka is the tale of how the starry-eyed young Willy (Timothée Chalamet) tries to set up a chocolate shop in a fictional city (sort of British, sort of American, sort of mainland European) in a fictional time period (sort of Victorian, sort of mid-20th Century). But his efforts are opposed by Slugworth (Paterson Joseph), Prodnose (Matt Lucas) and Fickelgruber (Mathew Baynton), the three businessmen mentioned in Dahl's novel as the rival sweet-makers who stole Wonka's recipes. The film's funniest characters, thanks to the actors' gleeful mispronunciation of half of their dialogue, these three slimy snobs bribe a chocoholic police chief (Keegan-Michael Key in a fat suit) to kick the interloper out of town.   But that's not all. A remarkable percentage of the running time is taken up by Willy being forced to work in a launderette by two Dickensian grotesques played by Tom Davis and Olivia Colman (who, judging by her performance here, should really have been cast as Trunchbull in Matilda the Musical). There are also subplots in which Willy has to learn to read, borrow a giraffe from a zoo, find the parents of his streetwise sidekick Noodles (Calah Lane), and break into the villains' lair, which happens to be directly beneath a cathedral. All of these hijinks are heightened by the brightly coloured stripy costumes, the Heath-Robinson inventions, oodles of Dahl-esque wordplay, and a range of clever Berlin cabaret numbers and Broadway show tunes by Neil Hannon of the Divine Comedy. There's also a generous helping of syrupy sentimentality. Between this and his two Paddingtons, it's clear that King likes his films to be more twee than their source novels, so anyone without a seriously sweet tooth may feel queasy before the end. Overall, then, Wonka seems to be straining every sinew to be the best possible family entertainment at cinemas this Christmas. It throws in everything, kitchen sink included. But what it doesn't have is one strong, gripping plot to build momentum and raise the pulse rate. It doesn't convince you that Willy's back story ever needed to be told. Slotting together bits from Mary Poppins, Sweeney Todd, Oliver Twist, and more besides, it's less like a finely crafted chocolate gateau than one of those selection boxes that contains several brand-name chocolate bars, all wrapped in garish plastic packaging. As it drifts back and forth between the launderette and the city square, between the present day and mawkish flashbacks to the past, it doesn't quite get going. And it keeps you waiting for a moment that will make you gasp or laugh out loud, as so much of Paddington 2 did. Chalamet, as talented as he is, is neither a great singer nor a great comedian, and he hasn't worked out how to make Willy anything beyond a gurning goofball. It's a relief when Hugh Grant shows up as a snooty, orange-faced Oompa-Loompa called Lofty, but beware, it's a cameo appearance which includes precious few scenes that aren't in the trailer. Wonka Director: Paul King Cast: Timothée Chalamet, Hugh Grant, Olivia Colman Run time: 1hr 56m Release date: 8 December UK, 15 December US   One aspect of the film which stops it being more enjoyable is that it is set in ""a world of pure imagination"", as the song from the 1971 film goes. Dahl's novel bristled with the author's annoyance at the nuisances of contemporary life, and even Paddington 2 was concerned with the injustices of modern Britain. But just as one scene has Willy being carried over the city by a bunch of helium balloons, the film ignores the gravitational pull of reality. Relentlessly wacky and over-the-top, everything in it is too contrived to care about. Oddly enough, that even applies to Willy's creations, which look more like toys than sweets, and which have so many magical properties that their flavour seems irrelevant. It's a small point, perhaps, but there has to be something wrong with a film about the world's best chocolate maker if it doesn't leave you with a craving to scoff some chocolate. ★★★☆☆ Wonka is released on 8 December in the UK and 15 December in the US If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news  "
Hawkish,Return to Scotland was vital - Hawkins,2024-09-25,2017-11-06,BBC Sport,https://www.bbc.com/sport/athletics/41891039,"Scotland's Callum Hawkins finished fourth in the men's marathon at the World Championships in London in August Scotland's Athlete of the Year Callum Hawkins admits he may have quit running if he had not returned from college in America five years ago. The 25-year-old marathon runner spent two years at Butler University in Indianapolis before moving back home. ""If I hadn't come back to Scotland when I did, I probably wouldn't be running now,"" Hawkins said. ""I've had two knee operations and have been fortunate to get back, and to a higher level than before."" Hawkins admits his lifestyle in America was not conducive to elite level performance, and that moving back to Scotland provided the focus he needed. Hawkins was named Scottish Athletics' Athlete of the Year at an awards ceremony on Saturday, external, having finished fourth at the world championships in London in August and set a Scottish half-marathon record. The Kilbarchan AAC runner, who became the first male to win the award since hurdler Allan Scott was named Athlete of the Year in 2008, suffered an injury during his time in America and believes that returning to Scotland enabled him to come back stronger. Scotland's Sammi Kinghorn was named Para Athlete of the Year on Saturday ""I look back now on things that happened a few years (ago) and think they happened for a reason,"" Hawkins said. ""It was while I was at Butler University that I damaged my knee and I still don't quite know how it happened. I've an idea but it was puffy for a year-and-a-half and then, via ultrasound, we found the cartilage had been torn. ""The first surgery was in 2012 and I didn't really get back into my running until well into 2014, when I ran the Glasgow 2014 qualifying time in California. So that was two years just to get back to where I had been at. ""I probably wasn't the best behaved to be honest, when out there in America. The lessons helped make me the athlete I am today and I have no regrets. ""There are different routes you can take. You look at Chris (O'Hare) who was over there young and went right through the system. Luke Traynor isn't quite the same profile but I think he has benefited a lot from being in America, too.  ""And then there's Laura (Muir), Andy (Butchart) and myself doing it more based in Scotland and in a slightly different way. Young athletes are seeing that leaving Scotland is not necessarily the best option for them. Hopefully Brits and Scots are showing we can compete at the top level globally."" Scottish wheelchair racer Sammi Kinghorn, who won two gold medals at the World Para-athletics championships in London in July, was Para Athlete of the Year, while 1500m runner Jeema Reekie was name Under-20 Athlete of the Year.

Hawkish,Funding for south west special needs hospital beds,2024-09-25,2023-12-01,By Georgina Barnes,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-67582001,"Plans for twenty new mental health hospital beds for people with learning disabilities or autism have been revealed for the south west. The NHS said it would invest more than £40.5m to improve acute mental health care for those whose ""needs cannot be met in a mainstream mental health hospital"". The beds will be split into two 10-bed units in Dawlish in Devon, and Bristol. Its hoped the move will bring an end to long distance placements. Director of nursing at NHS England South West, Jill Crook, said it would ""drastically"" transform health services available to people with a learning disability and autistic people. She added: ""This is part of a wider programme of work, including continued improvement to community services and the new beds will not result in more people being admitted to hospital, instead only those who genuinely need to be in hospital can be, and closer to home. ""We are working hard across our systems, and importantly with people with lived experience to get this right."" NHS England South West said subject to planning permission, the facilities would be placed at the Blackberry Hill Hospital site in Bristol and at the Langdon Hospital site in Dawlish. Tina Emery, from the National Network of Parent Carer Forums, said it would provide specialised support for those that needed it. She said: ""This is brilliant news for families and their loved ones in the south west.  ""For far too long parents and carers have had to travel hours at a time, often hundreds of miles from home to visit their loved ones.  ""New services in the south west will make it easier for parents and carers to visit, support and advocate for their loved ones, speeding up the process of recovery and them returning home.""

Callum and Tsegai Tewelde both qualified automatically as the first two Britons across the line in Sunday's London Marathon. Derek, 26, will also go to Brazil after posting a personal best time of two hours, 12 minutes 57 seconds, inside the 2:14:00 qualifying mark. English duo Ally Dixon and Sonia Samuels will run in the women's event.  Derek Hawkins, who had a nervous wait to find out if he would be a selectors' pick, told BBC Scotland: ""I was in my bed when I got a phone call early this morning; I was elated.  ""When I crossed the line, I was the third Brit and just out of the automatic selections, but I ran a PB and you feel that you have justified your selection. ""But it is a matter for the selectors, so it out of your control and you are sitting there thinking for a couple of days."" Callum Hawkins, 23, finished eighth in the London Marathon in a new personal best of 2:10:52 and hailed it as a great achievement for their father, Robert, who is also their coach. Tewelde runs for Shettleston Harriers in Glasgow ""Before Sunday, he was a bag of nerves and probably more nervous than us,"" he said. ""To get us both in is huge. ""To have your training partner and brother in the same race at the Olympic Games is going to be unbelievable."" Asked what his target would be in Rio, the younger Hawkins said: ""In a perfect world, top 20, but it is going to be really tough and conditions are going to be pretty tough - something I've never experienced before in a marathon."" Tewelde, a Glasgow-based Eritrean who claimed asylum in Britain in 2008, ran 2:12:23 to finish 12th in what was his first marathon. It caps a remarkable story for the 25-year-old, who still bears the scars on his forehead from a landmine that exploded next to him when he was eight, killing his friend. ""It's massive for me,"" said Tewelde. ""It's exciting to be part of the British team and I'm very happy.""

Hawkins, a semi-finalist in Sheffield in three of the past four years, led 5-3 thanks to four first-session half-centuries. The world number six added three more 50s after the resumption to go 8-3 up. He then won three of the next five, ending with a century, to move within two frames of a stunning win. World Championship schedule & BBC coverage times China's world number three Ding, 31, was the bookmakers' tip to secure a first world title following early exits for reigning champion Mark Selby and world number two Ronnie O'Sullivan - as well as his stunning 13-4 thrashing of Anthony McGill in round two. But the 2016 runner-up was way off that standard in the first 11 frames, wasting numerous chances as he slipped 8-3 behind. Barry Hawkins' dominance in numbers, as Ding Junhui struggled to live up to the bookmakers' billing A confidence-building 102 - the first century in the match - got Ding back on track and he backed it up with a frame-winning 52. But Hawkins, 39, remained consistently impressive, taking his match tally of 50-plus breaks to eight and rounding off a majestic performance with a brilliant 113 clearance for a commanding lead heading into Wednesday's third and final session from 10:00 BST. Kyren Wilson's high-risk, attacking style produced seven wins from eight evening session frames In a repeat of January's Masters final, England's Kyren Wilson put on a ruthless attacking performance to lead Mark Allen 11-5 after their second session. Wilson, the world number nine, won seven of the eight frames in the evening session, playing high-risk snooker and putting the Northern Irishman under pressure with some relentless potting. The 26-year-old rattled off breaks of 125, 105, a 92, two 90s and three further half-centuries and needs just two frames to progress when the match resumes on Wednesday at 14:30. World number 16 Allen had taken the final frame of a high-quality morning's play to tie the scores at 4-4. But his form dipped and Wilson's brave shot selection paid dividends, unlike in the Masters final where his radar failed him and Allen's composure saw him win a first 'Triple Crown' event. Judd Trump just shaded a competitive first session against John Higgins in their quarter-final World number four Judd Trump showed his potting power and battling qualities to take a 5-3 lead over Scotland's John Higgins in the first session of their World Championship quarter-final. Trump took the opening frame against the 30-time ranking event winner. Higgins levelled, but runs of 58, 100 and 71 saw the Bristolian take control. World number five Higgins hit back to win the next two despite being far from his best, but a fine 77 break earned Trump a two-frame advantage. Four-times winner Higgins, 42, had an extra day off after his 13-1 thrashing of Trump's good friend Jack Lisowski in round two. But he struggled to match his performance in a repeat of the 2011 final, with Trump outscoring his opponent, potting more balls and also having greater safety success. Trump, 28, pinched a pivotal third frame by two points after Higgins broke down on 57. The Scot responded to get to within a frame at 4-3, but he missed a relatively simple red which allowed Trump to get the lead his play had merited. Two-time runner-up Ali Carter, who won a feisty round-two match with O'Sullivan, is level with two-time champion Mark Williams at 4-4. World number seven Williams, 43, opened with a magnificent 135 and looked set to go 2-0 ahead after a break of 60. But Carter, 38, pinched the frame with a 63 and led 2-1 thanks to a stunning 126 before both players had two-frame runs in a topsy-turvy encounter.

""It was nice to get it over and done with. I struggled earlier but I am pleased to get through,"" said Trump. ""Coming into the tournament, I felt the ones who hadn't played too much would go on and those who had, would burn themselves out, which is what has happened.

""I'm pleased with how I held it together at the end and we will see what happens in the next round. I'm just going to enjoy every minute."" Kent-based Hawkins had won only two of seven matches at the Crucible before this year but has now beaten Jack Lisowski, world number one Mark Selby and Ding. World number nine Ding, a World Championship semi-finalist in 2011, played poorly and missed the brown with only the colours remaining when presented with a good chance to win the third frame of the session. Hawkins, ranked 14th in the world, took that frame and the following one to seal the victory. Walden resumed with a 10-6 lead against 21-year-old Welsh qualifier White and won the next three frames 56-51, 78-20, 69-44 to also book his first semi-final appearance. The 30-year-old Walden said: ""I'm overjoyed with that. It's been good so far and I'm pleased to be in the semis."" Hawkins has Terry Griffiths, the 1979 world champion, in his camp and 26-year-old Ding said he would like to work with a similarly experienced former professional to help improve his game. ""It might be good to get help from an old player's experience, but I haven't got anyone to help me, so I do everything myself,"" Ding said. ""I'd like to listen if they could tell me something I'm doing wrong."" He added: ""I've only had one week off in the last year. I really need a holiday, just to be free for a day. ""I'm not disappointed. I can relax now. It's all over now.""

Hawkish,Hawkins confident after opening win,2024-09-25,2013-04-22,Owen Phillips,https://www.bbc.com/sport/snooker/22251827,"Barry Hawkins says his confidence could not be any higher after cruising into ""the thick of the World Championship"" with a slick first-round display against qualifier Jack Lisowski. The Australian Open champion continued his impressive form this season with a 10-3 win over the Crucible debutant. ""I played really solid,"" the London-born cueman told BBC Sport. ""After the season I have had my confidence cannot be any better really."" Hawkins, who will be 34 on Tuesday, has played some of the most consistent snooker of his career this season and secured his first ranking event title with victory over Peter Ebdon in the final of the Australian Goldfields Open in Bendigo in June. Hawkins, up to 14 in the world rankings, said he felt relaxed and in an ideal place to make the most of his good form and calm mood. ""It has taken me a long time to get to this stage,"" he said. ""I have had a lot of setbacks in my career, but I have kept fighting, kept practising and working hard and I feel that now is the time to have a decent run here."" His prospects look encouraging after an emphatic victory over 21-year-old Lisowski. ""I was pleased with the way I performed throughout the match,"" said Hawkins, who will play Mark Selby or Matthew Selt in the second round.  ""I didn't finish off as well as I would have liked but I think I did the job early doors. ""I am delighted to still be in the tournament and in with a shout."" Hawkins, who is making his eighth successive appearance at the Crucible, has now reached the second round on his last three visits. ""The first match is always one of the toughest because you want to be really involved in the tournament,"" the Ditton resident said. ""Once you get through the first round, you are in the thick of it. Now I have got that out of the way I can settle down and try to treat it like any other tournament. ""Obviously it's the World Championship so it is always at the back of your mind; it's the biggest stage and you want to do really well. ""But I have been to a lot of venues and been to this place a lot of times so I know what to expect.""

Hawkish,'Snooker-mania' escape boosts Hawkins,2024-09-25,2015-04-23,Owen Phillips,https://www.bbc.com/sport/snooker/32431681,"Hawkins will face world number 12 Mark Allen in the last 16 at the Crucible on Friday World Championship Venue: Crucible Theatre, Sheffield Dates: 18 April-4 May Coverage: Watch live on BBC TV, HD, Red Button, Connected TV, online, tablets, mobiles and BBC Sport app. Full details here. Barry Hawkins says the picturesque serenity of the Derbyshire countryside has helped him relax and find his best form at the Crucible. The world number five was the 2013 runner-up and he proved it was no fluke by reaching the final four at last year's World Championship. And he told BBC Sport staying in a cottage a short drive away from Sheffield has helped him stay calm prior to another attempt at winning snooker's showpiece event. ""It is ideal really,"" said Hawkins, who needed to call on all his powers of relaxation as he saw a 9-4 lead slowly whittled away in his 10-9 first-round win over Matthew Selt. ""It's in the countryside, it has unbelievable views and on a lovely day it feels perfect - away from all the hustle and bustle of Sheffield and the snooker-mania. ""I get fed up with staying in hotels and if you are going to be here for a week or two you want to be as comfortable as possible. ""I stumbled across it a couple of years ago online and as long as I am playing at the Crucible I will always try to stay there."" The eagerly awaited tranquil trip was very nearly a mini-break this year, with Hawkins coming perilously close to wasting his money before finally shaking off Selt's comeback. Avoiding defeat in that match means Ronnie O'Sullivan remains the only man to have beaten Hawkins at the Crucible since 2012. Hawkins' appearance in the 2013 final against Ronnie O'Sullivan was the first time he had gone beyond round two at the Crucible since turning professional in 1996 But the run to the 2013 final, where he lost 18-12, and last year's 17-7 defeat in the last four mean that although the title still eludes him, Hawkins did at least get full value from his countryside retreat. And the Kent-based, London-born left-hander said this season's tough Sheffield opener may do him some good - as long as there is no repeat when he starts his second-round, three-session match against Mark Allen on Friday. ""It gives me a lot of confidence and shows I can do it under the utmost pressure,"" the 'Hawk' said. ""I just hope I just don't have to do it again. ""If you can get through the first couple of rounds playing really well and get through quite easy, and conserve some energy for the later rounds, then it is a massive advantage.  ""Last year I came through some really tough battles and when I played Ronnie in the semi-finals I was absolutely wiped out. ""I had nothing left in the tank whatsoever. It was the first time I have ever felt like that.  ""I went quite far behind and just wanted him to finish me off. I just couldn't wait to get out of there. It's mentally draining and not a nice feeling to have."" At least Hawkins had three full days off after Monday's nerve-jangling win over Selt.

He knows he needs to be, against one of the most attacking players on the circuit. ""It just gets tougher and tougher from now on,"" said Hawkins, who has only beaten the Northern Irishman once in nine previous meetings. That win was in their last encounter, a 5-1 success at the German Open in 2013. The only time they have played each other in a match longer than a first-to-five format came at the Crucible in 2011, Allen winning a thrilling encounter 13-12 with a break of 123 in the deciding frame. ""Mark is so gritty and determined and is a great player,"" the two-time ranking event winner said. ""If he gets going he bangs in big breaks all day long and he has a great all-round game. ""I will have to be at the top of my game to win. I am thoroughly looking forward to it; I like the way Mark plays and hopefully it will be free-flowing.""

World number 12 Allen, 29, played some stunning snooker as he went 11-8 ahead. But world number five Hawkins won five frames in a row to progress. ""I didn't do a lot wrong but, at the latter stages, you have to do a lot more right than I did,"" Antrim potter Allen told BBC Sport. ""The last session was frustrating. Barry did a good job and froze me out. Any chances I had were half-chances and the balls were awkward. ""Barry did very well and I was probably average. But it should have been over after the first 20 frames. I felt Barry was hanging on.""

Five-time champion Ronnie O'Sullivan celebrated his 42nd birthday with a 6-1 win over Welshman Michael White in the third round of the UK Championship. O'Sullivan was dominant early on, making a stunning 132 on his way to a 4-1 lead against the world number 26. An error-strewn sixth frame also went O'Sullivan's way and he closed out victory with a break of 65. World number eight Barry Hawkins was a shock last-32 loser against Thailand's Sunny Akani.

Murphy faces Ricky Walden in the fourth round, following the Chester man's impressive 6-2 victory over world number 13 Kyren Wilson, while Mark King, Martin Gould and three-time champion John Higgins also progressed on day eight at the York Barbican. World number four O'Sullivan said he was not at his best in beating an out-of-sorts White. O'Sullivan, who is seeking to match Steve Davis' record haul of six titles in the event, made his third century of the tournament and added a further three breaks of more than 50 to move into the last 16. This video can not be played 'Let's have a bit of the jungle' - O'Sullivan Another title would also see him draw level with Stephen Hendry's 18 'Triple Crown' triumphs, having won the World Championship five times and the Masters on seven occasions.

I wasn't brilliant but some people scramble better than others when they need to, and I was able to do that."" With 12 of the top 16 seeds having already lost in York - including the world's top three Mark Selby, Judd Trump and Ding Junhui - O'Sullivan's hopes are looking increasingly strong. O'Sullivan showed flashes of his fluent best early on, but his margin of victory was as much down to White's struggles as his own efforts. White, 26, said: ""I was absolutely awful. It's so frustrating. I didn't even play half-decent."" O'Sullivan added: ""You could see Michael struggling out there and the more you miss the harder it gets. I kind of felt for him. He's a good lad and he loves the game and it was frustrating for him. ""I want to play well and do well but if I don't, I don't care. I have other more important stuff to do."" Higgins, 42, held off a fine fightback by Chinese teenager Yan Bingtao to progress with a 6-3 victory. The Scot hit breaks of 66 and 80 as he moved 3-0 ahead, but Yan, 17, then responded with two-half centuries of his own to help bring him level. But Higgins' superior matchplay began to tell and two more 50s saw him over the line. Higgins, who plays Mark King in the next round following the Englishman's win over Luca Brecel, said: ""I competed well. My safety was good against a very talented player.

Higgins will face Barry Hawkins after the Englishman beat Noppon Saengkham 6-4 in the earlier semi-final. Higgins and Ronnie O'Sullivan have both won four Welsh Open titles, with the Scot beating O'Sullivan 5-1 in this year's quarter-final. ""I don't like semi-finals, I am really relieved,"" Higgins told BBC Wales. ""I am delighted to be through to another final. It would be amazing to win it for a fifth time, amazing. ""It would be some record for myself to win it five times, it would be brilliant, but Barry will be gunning to win it for his first time. ""It should be a good final between two top-eight players."" Scores & schedule Watch the Welsh Open on the BBC Higgins held a 2-1 advantage before taking a close fourth frame with a brilliant pink pot after it seemed the Scot had lost his chance, but Wilson took the next frame with a break of 61 to cut Higgins' lead to 3-2. A break of 99 then restored the four-time world champion's advantage and playing well, he quickly made that 5-2. The match finished with another flourish as Higgins added a break of 106, his 710th century in tournament play. Hawkins, World Championship runner-up in 2013, did not manage a century break in his win over Saengkham, but did enough to progress. ""I missed some easy ones, I just struggled and I am a lucky boy to be in the final,"" Hawkins said after a break of 63 made the 10th frame decisive. Hawkins will now appear in a sixth ranking final, chasing a fourth win. ""It was hard work, a horrible game, he was a difficult opponent to play against... I struggled at the table a bit,"" Hawkins added to BBC Wales. ""I will try and forget about today and play like I did in the quarter-final. If I play like I did today in the final I will get murdered."" Hawkins, who beat China's Yan Bingtao to reach the last four, opened up a 3-1 advantage with a break of 94, but there was not much fluency from either player. A 37-minute seventh frame was edged by Hawkins on the colours to make it 5-2 before Saengkham, playing in his first ranking semi-final, cut the deficit to 5-3 in another cagey frame. The match finally had a century break when Saengkham secured his third of the tournament, sinking a long red to set up a break of 139, but Hawkins won the 10th and with it the match.

Teignbridge District Council and Devon County Council are applying to the government for ""levelling-up"" funding.  As well as the dedicated new cycle route, the scheme would help provide better connectivity to a new housing development at Wolborough. The government is expected to make a decision by the autumn, Teignbridge councillors were told. The local authority will put in £500,000 and Devon County Council has agreed to pay £1m, said the Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS). Speaking at this week's annual meeting, Councillor Gary Taylor, executive member for planning, said the route would make ""better use of existing infrastructure and encourage increased cycling along one of Teignbridge's most important commuter corridors"". He added: ""The scheme, with its new links, would deliver more sustainable, low carbon and low-cost travel choices and would secure long-lasting benefits for people living and working in the area."" Some councillors questioned why the authority was not instead focussing on the long-awaited next section of the Teign Estuary Trail, from the Passage House Inn to Teignmouth, that was approved by the county council last year. An officer explained that projects awarded levelling-up funding have to be completed by March 2025 and the county council had advised that it was ""not feasible"" to get the Teign Estuary Trail done within that timescale. The officer added, however, that the trail was a ""popular scheme and a high priority"". Follow BBC News South West on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. Send your story ideas to spotlight@bbc.co.uk."
Hawkish,Macron flexes political muscle in boxing photos,2024-09-25,2024-03-20,By Andre Rhoden-Paul,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68618722,"First he flexed his muscles on Ukraine. Now Emmanuel Macron has gone one further, releasing photos of him hitting a punchbag with bulging biceps in a show of his strength in action. The French president's photographer posted two images on Instagram, days after he began to take a far more hawkish public line against Russia. It was not long before ""Rocky"" began to trend on social media. Perhaps inevitably, others questioned whether the photos had been ""enhanced"".  Doubters pointed to the size of his biceps, and re-posted the boxing picture alongside an image of Mr Macron, 46, with a skinnier arm.   Others joked and tweeted the pictures, taken by Soazing de la Moissonnière, saying that they showed Mr Macron, a keen boxer, getting ready to take on Russia and its 71-year-old president, Vladimir Putin.  They were published less than a week after the French president suggested sending Western troops to Ukraine could not be ruled out.  Speaking on French TV last Thursday, he warned that Russia was seeking to extend its power and would not stop now. ""If we leave Ukraine alone, if we let Ukraine lose this war, then for sure Russia will threaten Moldova, Romania and Poland,"" he said. The imagery will not be lost on his adversary in the Kremlin, who has been repeatedly photographed bare-chested to show his own personal fitness. Gaspard Gantzer, a well-known public relations expert, told newspaper Nice-Matin that the president wanted the images to show ""he is a Frenchman like any other ... that he is in great physical shape ... that he wants to fight."" Broadcaster CNews said of the pictures: ""In the two photos, we see the head of state ready to fight, his gaze fixed on the punching bag. ""As if he was determined to beat his opponents. The drawn features, the bulging muscles, the clenched teeth, the president looks like a true warrior."" French weekly women's magazine Femme Actuelle painted a more flattering view, saying the photos ""hit hard"" and also pointed to bulging biceps. However, the photos did not go down well with all in France.  Sandrine Rousseau, an opposition Greens MP, reposted the photo on Twitter with the comment: ""What misery of politics!"" ""The pose seems advantageous,"" the French daily newspaper Le Figaro said, but added that the photos had ""aroused much mockery"". Mr Macron is among a long list of politicians who have been keen to show off their sporting prowess.  President Putin famously paraded bare-chested on a horse and is no stranger to an ice hockey match or releasing a judo DVD.  Mr Macron previously made headlines with a very relaxed photo of him in an unbuttoned shirt and chest hair on full display.   His wife, Brigitte Macron, said in November that the president did boxing training twice a week."

The unit will provide an appointment-priority service, allowing people to book appointments for the same day. Health bosses closed the unit in response to the Covid-19 pandemic due to staffing levels and service demands.

""Our teams have worked hard over a long period of time to reach this point.

The NHS said walk-in visitors would also be supported, but appointments would be prioritised - ""so people may be redirected"". It said the unit would reopen without X-ray facilities due to ""radiology workforce constraints"". Ms Davenport said the trust had followed the model at Totnes Community Hospital's MIU. ""The feedback on the 'appointment-priority' service at the MIU at Totnes Community Hospital has been very positive and has allowed us to deliver a consistent service in that area.

Hawkish,Crushed Palestinian hopes 30 years after Oslo accords,2024-09-25,2023-09-12,By Yolande Knell,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-66751704,"It is the 30th anniversary of the breakthrough Oslo Accords between Israel and the Palestinians. The peace deal led to the creation of the Palestinian Authority, intended to provide interim self-government for just five years while negotiations solved outstanding core issues in the conflict. Today, nearly a decade after peace talks collapsed, the PA remains in place, but is losing its legitimacy.   With its vibrant restaurants, bustling malls and new construction constantly under way, affluent Ramallah has become synonymous with the Palestinian Authority (PA). Since 1993 when the first of a pair of agreements known as the Oslo Accords were signed on the White House lawn, foreign donor money has flowed into this West Bank city, north of Jerusalem. Its streets contain smart government ministries with signs and stationery locating them in the State of Palestine. But Palestinians are acutely aware that this is a facade. As far as Palestinians were concerned, the PA was supposed to be replaced with an elected government, running their own independent state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, with its capital in East Jerusalem. That dream has become ever more distant. ""Things are bad and going backwards,"" Um Nabil, a middle-aged shopper in Ramallah's Manara Square tells me. ""Our lives now are full of instability."" While opinion polls indicated the Oslo Accords were originally supported by two-thirds of the Palestinian public, the huge optimism it generated has been replaced by deep gloom.   ""It's just an overwhelming perception that the Palestinian leadership made a huge mistake some 30 years ago,"" says veteran Palestinian pollster, Khalil Shikaki. ""The belief that the two-state solution is no longer viable is also overwhelming, and that is making people a lot more depressed.""  The reality of life for Palestinians is a grinding military occupation. Whichever way they drive out of Ramallah, they encounter Israeli checkpoints, soldiers, and settlements.   At the time the Oslo Accord was signed in 1993, there were just over 110,000 Jewish settlers living in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. Today, the figure is more than 700,000. Settlements are seen as illegal under international law but Israel has always disputed that. Now the country has its most hardline ever government - with religious nationalist ministers who advocate annexation of the West Bank.   Meanwhile, the PA - dominated by the Palestinian President's Fatah faction - is weak and lacks initiatives to force Israel to stop expanding on land wanted for a future Palestinian state. It is corrupt and authoritarian and often seen as a tool of Israel's occupation.   There is huge resentment at how PA security forces co-ordinate with the Israeli army to arrest Palestinians allegedly planning attacks against Israelis. Members of the public also note that senior PA officials enjoy large salaries and VIP-style travel permits which ease Israeli restrictions on movement for them and their families. They believe that they use their status to help their allies gain access to such permits, as well as coveted public positions and contracts. Some 60% of the Palestinian public now see the Authority as a burden, according to Dr Shikaki's surveys. Six months ago, a slim majority even said that its collapse would serve their national interest. After Israel captured the West Bank and Gaza from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East War, its military governors ruled the territories directly. Meanwhile, East Jerusalem was annexed to Israel in a move that was not internationally recognised.  As a result of the Oslo Accords, leaders of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) - newly recognised by Israel as the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people - returned from exile abroad. The PLO had renounced terrorism and recognised Israel's right to exist in peace. With Yasser Arafat as president, the newly created PA began to take over basic services such as health, education and policing in Gaza and parts of the West Bank. Some 60% of the West Bank remained under full Israeli control but Palestinians hoped to expand their hold over time. It only took a few years for progress to come grinding to a halt.  The collapse of peace talks at Camp David in 2000 was followed by Palestinian fury when Israel's opposition leader visited Jerusalem's most sensitive holy site - the al-Aqsa Mosque compound, known to Jews as Temple Mount - seeking to promote Israeli sovereignty there.  The deadly violence of the second Palestinian intifada, or uprising, then left the peace process in tatters and strengthened the hawkish Israeli right-wing. Although negotiations were later brokered by the US, they achieved little; the last round fell apart in 2014. In his comfortable office in Ramallah, I meet Sabri Saidam, a former PA education minister who is now deputy secretary general of the Fatah Central Committee. He rejects the idea that the Authority is ineffective, describing its creation as ""a milestone."" His message is that propping it up preserves the possibility of the two-state solution - the international formula for peace. ""It is not the finale, yet it reflects an achievement the Palestinians would like to preserve,"" he says, spelling out how the PA has helped consolidate a Palestinian identity, established institutions, reinforced law and order and taken on tens of thousands of public workers. With the cash-strapped PA currently struggling to pay full salaries to employees, Dr Saidam urges crisis-weary international donors to step up, raising the spectre of chaos and collapse otherwise.    Undermining the legitimacy of the PA is its steady drift towards autocracy. Presidential elections brought Mahmoud Abbas to power for a four-year term in 2005, but now 87 years old, as the head of the PA and PLO, he continues to serve by his own decree overseeing an increasingly broken system.   The last parliamentary elections held in 2006 were won by Fatah's bitter rival, the Islamist party, Hamas, which is committed to the destruction of Israel. Efforts to form a unity government that the world could accept ultimately failed and in 2007, Hamas seized full control of Gaza, after days of deadly inter-factional fighting. It continues to rule there and the damaging internal political rift persists. Parliament remains suspended. While criticising the PA - even on social media - is increasingly risky, those who do speak out argue that today it has become preoccupied with its own survival and maintaining benefits for its leaders.   ""It's the opposite of self-determination and self-government,"" complains Diana Buttu, a Palestinian-Canadian lawyer and former spokesperson for the PLO. ""It's become a dictatorship and rule by those who are unelected, with no real connection to any political process."" Today, Palestinians aged under 35 have never voted in a general election. Ms Buttu and others call for new elections and a definitive push by world powers to force Israel out of occupied territory.  However, foreign players seem unwilling to take bold steps. Back in the heart of Ramallah, the legacy of Oslo shapes the rhythms of daily life as PA workers leave their offices and pupils from government schools head home.   But people of all ages are worried. There is a looming fear of internal strife when the PA's unpopular, elderly president finally leaves the political stage without a clear successor, and then the stress of the daily news. A woman in her 20s recounts how two brothers from her village were killed on the same day by Israeli troops during an incursion late last year. ""Their poor mother received the news like a thunderbolt,"" she says. A shopkeeper, Abu Saleh, will not let his four sons leave the city. ""I'm afraid of crossing paths with the Israeli army and settlers,"" he explains. He no longer visits his brother living an hour's drive away in Nablus.   Recent months have been the bloodiest in the West Bank for years with regular Israeli military raids, a series of shootings by Palestinian militants and growing violence by extremist settlers. Some pockets of the West Bank - particularly in the flashpoints of Nablus and Jenin - have fallen outside the PA's control.  The loss of faith in PA leaders has boosted militants from Hamas and Islamic Jihad still committed to armed struggle against Israel and led to the creation of new, more localised groups. ""We're so tired,"" sighs the young woman in Ramallah, summing up the general mood. ""We just want this conflict to end."" Yet three decades on from a landmark deal, there is no end in sight.  While there is real frustration at today's PA - its international role now entangled with that of the PLO - that is compounded by a sense that it also controls the only real mechanisms for any paths to progress in achieving peace."
Hawkish,Israel defence minister resigns over Gaza,2024-09-25,2018-11-14,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-46207094,"Israel's defence minister has resigned over the cabinet's decision to accept a ceasefire ending two days of fighting with Palestinian militants in Gaza. Avigdor Lieberman denounced the move as ""surrendering to terror"". He said his right-wing Yisrael Beiteinu party would leave the ruling coalition, which could lead to an early election. Eight people were killed on Monday and Tuesday as militants fired 460 rockets towards Israel and Israeli forces bombed 160 targets in Gaza. The ceasefire was largely holding on Wednesday and schools and businesses in southern Israel reopened after no rocket attacks were reported overnight. However, Israel's military said it had shot at and captured a Palestinian man who tried to breach the Israel-Gaza border fence while hurling grenades. Palestinian health officials later said a fisherman had been killed by Israeli fire in northern Gaza. The Israeli military said soldiers had shot the man because he was advancing towards the border fence.  The fighting - the most intense since the 50-day war in 2014 - began after an Israeli special forces undercover operation in Gaza was exposed on Sunday, triggering clashes that left seven Palestinian militants and one Israeli soldier dead.  Late on Monday, militants launched a barrage of rockets and mortars at Israel. One of the rockets hit a block of flats in the town of Ashkelon, killing a Palestinian man who was working in Israel. In response, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) carried out what it called a wide-scale attack against targets belonging to the militant groups Hamas, which dominates Gaza, and Islamic Jihad. The Hamas-run Gaza health ministry said seven people were killed in the strikes. Five of the dead were said to be militants and the other two farmers.  Hamas and other Palestinian factions announced on Tuesday afternoon that they had accepted an Egyptian-mediated ceasefire and would abide by it if Israel did. Israel's security cabinet initially said only that it was ordering the military to continue its operations as required, but Mr Lieberman and another minister appeared to confirm it had agreed to accept a ceasefire when they denied supporting it. At a news conference in Jerusalem on Wednesday, the defence minister said the military response to the rocket fire had been ""insufficient and inappropriate"". He added that the government was making a serious mistake by accepting a ceasefire with Hamas and other militant groups that Israel, the US, EU and UK have designated as terrorist organisations. ""We are buying quiet for the short term at the price of serious damage to national security in the long term"" he warned. Mr Lieberman revealed he had similarly opposed recent decisions to allow into Gaza fuel for the territory's power plant and $15m (£12m) in cash from Qatar intended to fund the salaries of unpaid civil servants in the Hamas-run government. ""I could not remain [in office] and still be able to look residents of the south in the eyes,"" he added. Dozens of residents of Israeli border communities protested after the ceasefire announcement at what they called the ""lack of action by the Israeli government"" to deal with the threat of Palestinian rocket attacks. Mr Lieberman also announced that Yisrael Beiteinu would leave the ruling coalition and called on other parties to agree on an early date for a general election, which is not due until November 2019. By Yolande Knell, BBC News, Jerusalem This announcement by Mr Lieberman was expected.   He has been calling for tough Israeli military action against Hamas and has opposed ongoing efforts by Egypt and the UN to secure a long-term ceasefire deal that would quieten the Israel-Gaza border. His hawkish stance as defence minister has often left him at odds with the military top brass. But it plays out well with the voter base of his political party. The decision to withdraw Yisrael Beiteinu from the coalition government weakens Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who now controls just 61 of 120 parliamentary seats.   However, an official close to Mr Netanyahu told the BBC it was ""not necessary to go to elections in this sensitive security period"". He added that the prime minister would now take over the defence ministry. Mr Netanyahu's office said he was holding consultations with ministers from his right-wing Likud party and other party leaders in effort to stabilise his coalition.  Earlier, the prime minister defended the ceasefire decision, saying that ""in times of emergency, when making decisions crucial to security, the public can't always be privy to the considerations that must be hidden from the enemy"". ""Our enemies begged for a ceasefire and they knew very well why,"" he added. Opposition leader Tzipi Livni of the centre-left Zionist Union alliance demanded an early general election. ""The government of failure in security must go,"" she said. ""No peace, no security - elections now that will lead to an emergency coalition headed by the Zionist Union. We will restore security and act for peace."" Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri said Mr Lieberman's resignation was ""recognition of the defeat before the growing force of Palestinian resistance"". "
Hawkish,Burglars in raids spate 'may have struck before',2024-09-25,2024-03-12,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0w654yw0p9o,"Burglars behind a series of raids before Christmas are thought to have struck again, say police. Devon and Cornwall Police said burglaries in Devon between 19 February and 11 March ""may be linked to 15 burglary reports prior to Christmas"", said officers. In the latest incidents, offenders entered properties in Fulford Drive in Cullompton, Dawlish Road in Exeter, Hillside in Sidmouth, South Molton Street in Chulmleigh and School Lane in Thorverton, they added. Police urged anyone with CCTV, dashcam or doorbell footage that may help investigations to come forward. In the latest five burglaries, offenders got in by either reaching through a cat flap, damaging doors to gain entry, or accessing via insecure doors and windows. Once inside, the offenders stole bank cards, car keys and the cars themselves, police said.  Of eight cars stolen, four have been recovered. Det Insp Guy Biggar said: ""Sadly, we’ve seen a continuation in this series of crimes, and I would urge the public to be extra vigilant on securing both houses and vehicles. ""If you have seen any suspicious behaviour, or have been a victim of an offence and not yet reported it, please get in touch with us. ""Equally, if you have any CCTV, dashcam or doorbell footage which may assist our enquiries, please report it to us to so we can investigate in full. ""In the meantime, we would ask residents to ensure that their homes are secure by keeping their doors locked at night and when they leave their property.""

Hawkish,How a North Korean missile researcher became a South Korean MP,2024-09-25,2024-04-12,Frances Mao,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c51n8w77z9wo,"As a young man, Park Choong-Kwon helped build the nuclear missiles that his homeland, North Korea, blasted off from time to time to threaten the West. Now he sits in its democratic neighbour’s legislature – a member of South Korea’s parliament elected just this week. When people migrate from authoritarian regimes to liberal democracies, they dream of a better life, of opportunities. A refugee becoming a lawmaker, or even one day president? It’s possible. But for a North Korean, it’s extraordinary. Park, at age 37, is just the fourth escapee ever to become a parliamentarian in the South. “I came to South Korea with nothing,” he told the BBC earlier this week, “and now I’ve entered the political arena. “I see all of this as the power of our liberal democracy and I think it’s all possible because our citizens made it happen. It is a miracle and a blessing.” For North Korean watchers, it's also a sign of progress. ""There are tens of thousands of North Koreans who voted with their feet, voted against the oppression of that regime with their lives - some lost - but others didn't, and the world is benefiting from them,"" says Sandra Fahy, an associate professor at Carleton University in Ottawa who's researched life in North Korea. ""Who better to understand the importance of democratic representation and political engagement than those who have lived in a world where it was forbidden?"" Park escaped the clutches of the North Korean state a decade and a half ago when he was 23, having breathed not a word of his plans to his parents and other family members. It was too risky, and if they had known, that could have put them in peril, he says. He had spent his last three years embedded in the National Defense University – one of the elite students seen as the next generation entrusted with developing the North’s nuclear weapons technology. While relatively sheltered in the capital, he had grown up in the North in the 1990s, the period of massive famine in the country where millions died and desperate citizens turned to black market goods. But he was exposed to life outside – through South Korean TV shows smuggled in and study abroad in China, where his fixation on new ideas drew scrutiny from his minders. By the time he graduated university, he told Korean media, he had realised “how completely wrong and corrupt the North Korean regime was”. So he hatched his plan and waited. The release came one day in April 2009. North Korea that day had just managed to successfully launch its first intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM)  – the very same weapon he had toiled away for years on building. The whole country was “in a celebratory mood”; he saw the opportunity and slipped away the next morning under the cover of the jubilant noise. Getting out was an ordeal of course - he chose the faster but vastly more expensive route to China, which cost nearly 10 million won (£5,800 pounds; $7,300). Despite the cost, the fake passport provided by the broker was a shoddy certificate. But in a interview with NK News last year, he recalled the moment he realised he was potentially free. Clambering onto the Chinese-side banks of the Tumen River, there was a mingled sense of freedom and loss - leaving him  feeling like an ""international orphan"". Another life-changing moment came some time later when he received his South Korean passport -  one of the happiest moments of his life, he says. Compared to many other defectors from the North, about 35,000 of whom have settled in the South since the 1990s, Park adapted quickly to his new life, a challenge smoothed out by his elite background and education. He was accepted into the country’s most prestigious university – Seoul National University – where he earned a PhD in materials science and engineering, and then landed a highly coveted job at Hyundai Steel, one of the South’s powerhouse conglomerates. And then the president’s party came knocking. Park told the BBC he hadn’t ever considered entering politics, but when the People Power Party reached out, he felt he wanted to give back through public service. As the number two delegate on the ruling party’s list for proportional voting seats, he was essentially guaranteed a spot in Wednesday’s elections – no matter how unfavourable the turnout. The results in the end were terrible for the deeply unpopular President Yoon Suk-yeol and his ruling PPP. But Park is forward-facing and has big plans now as an elected lawmaker. In the South’s previous parliament, there had already been two sitting North Korean members –  both with significant profiles. Thae Yong-ho, who represents the luxury district of Gangnam, was formerly a North Korean ambassador to the UK who famously defected in 2016 during his London stint. The other is rights activist Ji Seong-ho, who lost his left arm and leg as a young teenager in 1996 when he and his starving family were stealing coal from a train. He fainted from hunger and fell through a gap between the train cars; the wheels ran over him. He later managed an escape from North Korea on crutches. Those representatives have long sought to improve the situation for their fellow defectors. Many say while they may have a new lease on life since arriving in the South, it’s tinged with a feeling of being treated like second-class citizens. That pushed Ji into running for office in 2020, campaigning on the rights of North Koreans, after a case where defectors accused of smuggling were forcibly returned by South Korean officials. A year earlier, an impoverished North Korean mother and daughter were found dead in their apartment in Seoul, having reportedly starved to death. Park says one of his first aims is improving the support given to North Koreans when they arrive in the South – and he’s pushing for lifelong packages. He says since the flow of new arrivals slowed to a trickle due to pandemic border closures, the budget should be re-allocated. He also wants to leave his mark on inter-Korean relations. And in that vein, he’s heartily endorsed his president’s current hawkish attitude towards dealing with the North and Kim Jong-un’s increased missile provocations. While some say the North has reacted because it was spooked by Yoon pursuing closer relationships with the US and Japan, Park dismisses that theory. “Some people think that since the Yoon government came in, the threat of war has increased. But it’s not true – the provocations were stronger under the previous administration,” he told the BBC. He points out the North’s missile launches and weapons development increased during President Moon Jae-in's administration – which sought a more conciliatory approach to engaging with North Korea. But appeasement must not be the approach taken, he argues: “Blocking North Korea’s provocations is the most important priority, and that will lead to reducing the threat of war.” He believes in eventual reunification between the two halves of the peninsula. This is despite Kim Jong-un this year taking concerted steps to stamp out that prospect: branding the South as the enemy state and reportedly blowing up a massive arch symbolising the two Koreas coming together in the future. But Park is undeterred. He’s determined to “play a role as a bridge” in the South Korean government. “I want to help South Koreans view North Korea’s regime and its people separately, fostering a mindset conducive to unification.”"
Hawkish,Housemate 'stabbed student in music row' - court,2024-09-25,2024-04-12,By Pritti Mistry,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-humber-68797523,"Warning: This report contains offensive language. A student was stabbed to death by a housemate after an argument over the victim's taste in music escalated into violence, a court has heard. Sachin Hawkins died after he was fatally stabbed at the shared house he was staying in, on Hardy Street, Hull, on 15 November 2023. Syed Hussain-Kazi, 25, of Hardy Street, denies murder. Hull Crown Court heard the 19-year-old was ""stabbed through the heart"" with a 6in-long (15cm) bladed knife. Prosecutor Sharon Beattie told the jury of eight women and four men Mr Hawkins had been playing music and was standing in the doorway in the kitchen when Mr Hussain-Kazi, who had been drinking, ""started poking fun at his taste in music"". ""The defendant called him a faggot. Sachin replied back calling him a bitch,"" said Ms Beattie. ""They usually called each other names in a jokey way. ""On this day, however, it escalated when the defendant replied: 'what did you call me?'"" It was at this point Mr Hussain-Kazi stabbed the 19-year-old in the chest, the court heard. ""Sachin said 'he just stabbed me' and dropped to the floor,"" the prosecutor told the court. Mr Hussain-Kazi repeatedly retorted ""who's the bitch now?"" as another housemate held him back, the jury heard. The defendant was later heard by another saying ""I need to go"" before picking up his jacket and stepping over Mr Hawkins while uttering ""I'm sorry"" before leaving the house, the court was told. Following his arrest, Mr Hussain-Kazi denied murder and told police he ""had no intention to cause Sachin any harm"" and that he was ""my friend"", the prosecutor said. The jury heard there were previous concerns over the 25-year-old's behaviour, including an occasion in November 2022 at university halls of residence where he scared first-year flatmates when he ""started swinging a 30cm knife"" in front of a student's face, jurors heard. At the time Mr Hawkins had tried to talk him down and students believed the incident was ""drink-related"". ""The defendant has a tendency to pick up knives to intimidate others with little reason to do so"", said Ms Beattie. Jurors heard the pair met in their first year at the University of Hull and had been living together in the same halls. They formed a friendship and later moved together with three other friends into a student house on Hardy Street in August 2023. Mr Hawkins was originally from London but moved to America with his mother. He later decided to return to the UK. The 19-year-old was training to be a special education teacher.

Hawkish,Decade on from Dawlish railway devastation,2024-09-25,2024-02-04,By Zhara Simpson,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-68180709,"Ten years have passed since a powerful storm battered the South West of England, leading to the evacuation of homes and the destruction of a railway line. The tracks at Dawlish were left dangling by the force of the storm that began on the evening of 4 February 2014, cutting off the coastal town's only railway line to the rest of the region for eight weeks. Its sea wall had survived three recent storms but the latest proved too much for the defences to withstand as huge waves crashed over the top. About 50 people were evacuated from their homes that night. Among them was Peter Large and his family. They lived nearby in a three-storey house and were evacuated after 23:00 GMT. Mr Large compared the storm to a ""giant taking a sledgehammer to the front of the houses"". He said: ""You could see flashing lights. We had a knock at the door to say we had 10 minutes to evacuate. ""The sea wall was gone; we were worried there was a good chance the houses were going to go with it."" By John Ayres, BBC Spotlight The collapse of the sea wall at Dawlish initially started in the evening. I was in Looe, Cornwall, as the town had suffered really bad flooding, so I was staying in a hotel expecting to broadcast live from there in the morning. Instead, I received a call in the middle of the night saying: ""Get to Dawlish now, the railway has fallen into the sea!""   When we arrived in Dawlish, we couldn't go to the actual location where the wall had collapsed because it was too dark, unsafe and inaccessible. Residents had been evacuated from their homes.  We pitched up in town along the front near the station but ballast from the railway was being tossed by the waves up into the air.  It was raining rocks in Marine Parade so we had to relocate to a safe position.  Fortunately, as it began to get light the storm did ease back a bit although it was still pretty hairy. We positioned ourselves in the underpass between the road and the beach.  Although our first live broadcast was fine, I was ordered to relocate before the next one because there were fears viewers would complain, saying the scene was too dangerous.    Sea water was pouring through the underpass and out onto the road behind us. As the day went on the number of media outlets outside Dawlish station grew and grew, forming quite a media village.  After a night of being pounded by both the wind, rain and sea it was a relief to finally have a full breakfast - although that was only the beginning of the day.  Steve Briers, a cameraman who shot the devastation on the morning of 5 February, called 999 to alert emergency services. ""Every wave that came in was taking another section of the road out,"" he said. ""I thought it was a matter of time before the houses just went into the sea as well. ""I was very aware that I was now on an island. I remember it being a very busy morning."" Those evacuated were directed to a nearby guest house, Sea Lawn Lodge, where people arrived with blankets around their shoulders. Val Belcher, from the guest house, said: ""People had five minutes to get out their houses. I made them tea and coffee and they had to go through to our dining room. ""The police were there and took all the information they needed.""  Ten years on, Network Rail said a £165m package of resilience measures had been built, funded by the Department for Transport. It said the measures were ""proving to be effective"". Network Rail said the programme had delivered a stronger, taller sea wall for Dawlish and a new footbridge with lifts since 2019. Rail Minister Huw Merriman said: ""Thanks to more than £165m of government funding to restore and protect this vital stretch of railway, its future is now secured. ""This will provide residents with peace of mind - the line is better protected, no matter the weather."" Andy Bowes-Roden, deputy editor of Modern Railways, said the South West received among the lowest transport spends per head in the country. He said: ""In transport terms I think the government has let the South West down catastrophically. ""We've had billions spent in London, we're having billions spent in the Midlands, billions promised for the North. ""There was an integrated rail plan for £96bn for the Midlands and the North.   ""Now for a tiny fraction of that money, we could have that additional route between Exeter and Plymouth. ""We could strengthen our coastal railway, we could upgrade existing routes, we could expand bus services.""         Follow BBC Devon on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

Hawkish,Pressure mounts on Japan's Shinzo Abe,2024-09-25,2018-03-14,By Dr John Nilsson-Wright,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-43395476,"It is no exaggeration to say that the bolt out of the blue commitment by US President Donald Trump to sit down for talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has had a severe impact on Japan's government.  A carefully crafted, US-Japan co-ordinated strategy - of unremitting political and economic pressure on North Korea - has been a replaced by a new unilateral US policy of (albeit perhaps temporary) moderation. The shift is informed by Mr Trump's confident optimism that he will be able to reach a deal to negotiate away the North's nuclear weapons and advanced missile programme.  But the unexpected talks will have an impact in Japan not unlike the July 1971 announcement by then President Richard Nixon that he planned to travel to Beijing to meet Chairman Mao Zedong.  At that time, Japan's leaders experienced the ""nightmare"" they had struggled to avoid for the best part of two decades.  In an instant, and with barely 20 minutes of advance notice, the Japanese government had been informed that the Cold War policy of ""containment"" of China - that it had loyally sought to adhere to at the prompting of successive US administrations since 1950 - had been unilaterally ditched. Japan was left isolated and betrayed by its senior allied partner, creating a residue of distrust that rattled bilateral ties between Washington and Tokyo for years to come. For Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Mr Trump's diplomatic handbrake turn on North Korea could not have come at a worse time.  Having rushed to Washington to be the first foreign leader to meet with the president-elect in November of 2016, and relying on careful diplomatic preparation to better understand and manage America's new, mercurial and self-regarding leader, Abe may be forgiven for confidently thinking that his successful Trump Tower visit had given him an advantage with the president.  This confidence has suddenly evaporated. The Abe administration now appears not only dismayed by the lack of consultation from their US partner, but also deeply alarmed by two potential scenarios.  Historically, Japan has worried about the twin danger of being either abandoned or entrapped by its US ally. These fears are now dominating Japan's anxious assessment of what may happen at the May summit between Mr Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong-un.  Fear number one is that a transactional Trump, intent on getting an agreement with Kim to succeed where his presidential predecessors have failed, and to deflect attention away from his domestic political troubles arising from the Robert Mueller investigation, will sell the US-Japan alliance short.  The worry for Japan is that the president, in order to meet the North Korean demand for a security guarantee, will agree either to a dramatic reduction of US forces from the region (some or all of the 28,500 troops in South Korea or the 50,000 or so troops in Japan) or focus exclusively on US strategic interests at the expense of alliance interests. Mr Trump may confine himself to the long-range nuclear-armed missile challenge to the US, and he may be tempted to ignore or overlook the medium-range missile threat to Japan or other political concerns, including the unresolved fate of Japan's ""abductees"", citizens kidnapped from Japan by North Korean agents in the 1970s and 1980s.  Fear number two is that the May summit will fail to produce an agreement, and that a disgruntled Trump, having run out of diplomatic road, will feel that he has no choice but to order a military attack against the North.  War on the peninsula will then drag Japan, as America's ally, into a hugely costly and destructive war that will expose the country and its citizens to massive existential risk.  Trump's latest decision to replace the diplomacy-favouring Secretary of State Rex Tillerson with a more hawkish Mike Pompeo, who backs using military force against the North, has only heightened these fears of alliance entrapment.  Compounding this strategic, international crisis, is Mr Abe's exposure on the home front.  A long-simmering corruption and influence-peddling scandal dating from 2017 has suddenly re-surfaced, precisely at the same time as the Korea crisis.  The scandal risks implicating the prime minister's wife Akie Abe. She allegedly helped lobby for a deal allowing a controversial Osaka based school, Moritomo Gakuen, to buy state-owned land at massively reduced prices (86% below market value) on which to build a primary school. Reports in early March by Japan's progressive daily newspaper, Asahi Shimbun, suggest that officials from Japan's finance ministry, which was responsible for managing the land-deal, had selectively and deliberately removed from a number of documents submitted to Japan's parliament critical details highlighting the role of Mrs Abe and some of the questionable circumstances surrounding the land deal.  The scandal has already had a number of dramatic effects. On 9 March a local official from the Osaka finance bureau killed himself, prompting suggestions that it was a result of the scandal.  At the national level, the controversy has created sharp tensions between the cabinet and the parliament, with leading opposition politicians arguing that the government has actively sought to deceive the legislature - a grave charge in a political system that places a premium on parliamentary scrutiny.  In response, a senior bureaucrat, Nobuhisa Sagawa, the former head of the national tax agency and previously in charge of the finance ministry section responsible for handling the land-sale, has been forced to resign. His immediate boss, Taro Aso - the finance minister and deputy prime minister - is also under pressure to resign, not only from opposition politicians but even from some of his colleagues in the governing Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). The worry for Mr Abe is that the scandal will lead to demands for his resignation and potentially might even bring down his cabinet.  When the scandal first emerged in February of 2017, he publicly stated he would resign if it was revealed that either he or his wife had influenced the land-sale. The latest revelations make it harder for him to dispel the impression that there may have been some undue influence, if only implicitly.  For now, Mr Aso, the finance minister, has made it clear that he has no intention to go, and Abe has defended keeping him in post in order to get to the bottom of the procedural irregularities in the finance ministry.  However, there are two more compelling reasons for the prime minister to protect his colleague:  First, so long as Mr Aso stays in post, he acts as a political human shield for the prime minister, insulating him from direct criticism. Second, Mr Aso leads the second largest of the LDP's political factions and as such can deliver a critical number of party votes for the forthcoming LDP presidential election in September of this year.  Mr Abe hopes to win the election, securing in the process a third term as party leader and a minimum of three more years as prime minister.  It is too early to tell how much damage this second crisis will inflict on Mr Abe. The latest opinion polls reveal a 6% drop in the popularity of the government from 54% to 48%.  While bad news for the prime minister, the drop has not been as fast or as pronounced as that which took place in 2017 when the scandal first broke. Moreover, there is little evidence, so far, that the controversy is boosting the position of the opposition parties, which remain far less popular than the LDP. Paradoxically, the lifeline for the prime minister may be the North Korean crisis. The Japanese public is made increasingly anxious by developments on the peninsula and remains eager to see the May summit talks succeed. From the perspective of Japan's voters, success here most likely requires a stable and experienced government at the helm in Tokyo.  Good governance, good relationships (whether personal or national) and effective alliances depend on trust. It remains to be seen whether trust can be restored and maintained between both the governments of the United States and Japan and between Mr Abe and the Japanese electorate.

The Scot, 25, was leading the men's marathon when he collapsed just over a mile before the finish line after succumbing to the hot conditions. He had to wait several minutes for treatment at the roadside but had twice refused help. ""It's the athlete instinct to keep going, especially when you're leading it,"" Hawkins told BBC Sport. Collapse 'will make me better athlete' Hawkins' reluctance to receive any roadside assistant was because it would have meant instant disqualification from the race. But, admitting he had little memory of what happened, he said that, in hindsight, race officials should have been able to take the decision to pull him out of the race. ""I was desperate for a medal and I had put everything I could into it,"" he said.  ""So for somebody to stop me I probably would have told them to get one, but once I'd got back up, I had no recollection of it, so maybe I should have been pulled.  ""Maybe there needs to be a rule put in that, after two falls or something, or so long that it looks like you're not getting any better, there needs to be somebody to pull it like boxing."" Hawkins says he will make a return but will take longer than usual after being admitted to hospital following his collapse in the Gold Coast.

But the Englishman was way below his best from the start against world number 14 Fu on Tuesday. He scored only 31 points as he lost the first five frames. Hawkins got on the board in frame six, but Fu easily won the last two frames to earn a six-frame advantage after the first session.

But his chances of repeating that feat appear slim after being completely outplayed by London-based Fu, who recorded three half-centuries on his way to a 5-0 lead.  World number 11 Hawkins took a scrappy sixth frame, but two half-centuries gave Fu frame seven and he rounded off the session with his sixth score of more than 50. The other afternoon match saw four-time champion John Higgins win four frames in a row to take a 5-3 lead in his all-Scottish meeting with Alan McManus. McManus, twice a World Championship semi-finalist in the early 1990s, lost the opener but was then in imperious form as he secured a 3-1 mid-session interval lead with breaks of 114, 78 and 56. But the 45-year-old was out of sorts after the interval, appearing to be troubled by a neck problem. Higgins, who has gone on to lift the title on the past three occasions he has reached the last eight at the Crucible, made the most of some decent chances to take control.

Hawkish,Robertson beats Hawkins to win Masters,2024-09-25,2022-01-16,Shamoon Hafez,https://www.bbc.com/sport/snooker/60016682,"Neil Robertson won his first Masters title 10 years ago Australia's Neil Robertson claimed the Masters title for the second time by coasting past England's Barry Hawkins 10-4 at London's Alexandra Palace. Robertson's success comes 10 years after he won the prestigious invitational event for the first time. He opened up a 5-3 lead in the first session and converted the advantage with little trouble in the evening, aided by numerous errors from Hawkins. Robertson becomes the 10th player to lift the trophy more than once. He also collects a hefty £250,000 in prize money, while runner-up Hawkins takes home £100,000. Robertson said on BBC Two: ""With the players I have had to beat, it has to be right up there. Every match has thrown up a lot of challenges.

It was fantastic to hear the crowds cheer again."" Relive the 2022 Masters final World champion Selby 'needs help' with mental health Robertson further solidified his status as snooker's most successful non-British player by claiming his sixth Triple Crown event title - his two victories in this event going alongside his 2010 World Championship and three UK Championships. The 39-year-old has been the form player this season, picking up his second trophy after the English Open in November as well as finishing runner-up to Ronnie O'Sullivan in the World Grand Prix. Robertson gained revenge by ousting record seven-time champion O'Sullivan in the quarter-finals at Alexandra Palace and followed it up with a remarkable semi-final victory over Mark Williams on the final black, having needed two snookers in the deciding frame. He was visibly emotional after that match, saying spectators would ""probably never see"" a finish like that again and urging any kids watching to ""never give up"". Robertson was not fully firing in the final yet still compiled two centuries and six breaks of 50 or more to punish Hawkins. Robertson added: ""I got about 300 text messages tell me I have never seen anything like it [the semi-final] and coming in everyone was saying 'what about yesterday?' ""I think Barry was a little bit unlucky being in the second semi-final where he wins 6-5. Roles reversed, he could have won today."" Comebacks, 147s and streakers: Try our Masters quiz Hawkins is a consistent performer who regularly reaches the latter stages of events, but the world number 10 is becoming a major event 'nearly man'. He reached the semi-finals of the UK Championship in York last month and this was his third loss in a Triple Crown final after defeats by O'Sullivan at the Crucible in 2013 and again - a 10-1 crushing - at this event three years later. Hawkins seemed full of confidence when he too reached the final by winning a decider against world number two Judd Trump, but was out of sorts in the showpiece. Although he took the opening frame of the contest, missing straightforward pots against an opponent of Robertson's calibre was always going to prove costly and just two half-centuries with a top break of 69 highlighted his struggles. Hawkins said: ""I am not too disappointed because I've had a great week - one of the best of my life. There's been an unbelievable atmosphere and I've played some unbelievable matches. ""I made too many mistakes today and you can't do that against someone like Neil because he's a wonderful player."" Last year's Masters took place behind closed doors in Milton Keynes because of the coronavirus pandemic and the return to Alexandra Palace was a roaring success with the crowd creating a boisterous atmosphere throughout the tournament. Both players were given another tremendous reception in the final and although neither were at their best in the opening session, Robertson opened up a 5-3 advantage with breaks of 50, 105 and two runs of 54. Tied at 2-2, the fifth frame was pivotal with Hawkins making 60 but fouling the green with his sleeve, leaving Robertson a free ball and allowing him to pinch it with a clearance from the final red. Robertson found his groove in the evening session with runs of 50 and 68 extending his advantage to 8-4 and he finished it off with further breaks of 114 and 47 to clinch a dominant win.

Hawkish,Lisowski and Hawkins reach last eight,2024-09-25,2021-12-02,Steve Sutcliffe,https://www.bbc.com/sport/snooker/59508148,"Jack Lisowski has reached the final of six ranking events but is yet to win one 2021 Cazoo UK Championship Venue: York Barbican Dates: 23 November - 5 December Coverage: BBC One, BBC Two, BBC iPlayer, BBC Red Button, BBC Sport website and app BBC coverage times, schedule and results Jack Lisowski moved into the quarter-finals of the UK Championship with a 6-4 victory over Hossein Vafaei in York.  Lisowski, 30, was always in control of an up-tempo contest against Iran's world number 63, making breaks of 82, 88, 72 and 54 before sealing his win. Meanwhile, Barry Hawkins reeled off five frames in a row as he fought back from 3-1 down to beat Matthew Selt 6-3. World number 14 Hawkins kick-started his recovery with a run of 99 and made breaks of 103 and 92 as he progressed. Hawkins, 42, will now face Andy Hicks in the last eight after the 48-year-old won a final-frame decider to claim a 6-5 victory over David Gilbert.  Hicks, now ranked 102 in the world, made six half-century breaks in a contest in which the players were never separated by more than one frame.  The result sees Hicks, who made a telling break of 56 in the final frame, extend his best run at the tournament since reaching the semi-finals in 1995. In Thursday's other last-16 encounter Belgium's Luca Brecel completed a resounding 6-1 win over veteran Anthony Hamilton.  Hamilton, 50, who was ranked as high as 10th in the world earlier in his career, was hoping to reach his first quarter-final at the UK Championship.  Brecel, 26, opened up with consecutive 72 breaks as he raced into a 4-0 lead at the interval before booking a last-eight meeting with Scotland's world number 16 Anthony McGill. As one of the few remaining players in the world's top 16 still remaining in the tournament, Lisowksi - ranked 15th - was also expected to advance from a contest that involved minimal safety play. Vafaei dominated on the way to a stunning second-round victory over world number one Mark Selby, but a tentative start, which included losing the third frame after a break of 56 and an error-strewn fourth, simply left him with too much to do. While he more than played his part in a compelling contest with two half-century breaks and a clearance of 115 to battle back to 4-3 and 5-4, a difficult missed red along the bottom cushion, with the 10th frame delicately poised, cost him dearly. ""I was thinking go for it, 100%,"" Lisowski told BBC Sport. ""They are so tricky, I respected it but I would have played safe. I felt really good mentally, even if he had won that last frame I was staying positive which is something I have been working on. ""It's a strange old week with loads of seeds going out. When you are bumping into a [Judd] Trump, [Neil] Robertson, Ronnie [O'Sullivan], [Mark] Selby, they are a cut above the rest, so when they lose I guess it makes it a little bit easier."" Asked if he could go on to win his first major ranking event this week, Lisowski, who will now meet China's Zhao Xintong in the last eight on Friday, added. ""Why not? Every final I have had where I have done really well in tournaments, I have had Selby, Robertson and Judd and they are different mustard but they are not [left] in it this year. ""I still have to pot the balls, play really well and it is easier said than done."" World number 35 Selt, who beat pre-tournament favourite Judd Trump in the previous round, enjoyed the better of a protracted opening four frames, making breaks of 75 and 88 to establish a comfortable lead at the interval.  However, a fine break of 99 was the catalyst for a reversal of fortunes as Hawkins took control before finishing the match off with two more sizable contributions.  ""Going into the interval I was disappointed with the way it was going but I stayed calm and felt like I was getting stronger as the match went on,"" Hawkins said. ""If I can take how I played in the last part of the match on then I have a chance but anything less will not be good enough.  ""According to [Stephen] Hendry we have got to give Ronnie [O'Sullivan] the trophy now but I am sure a few players will try and have a say about that."" World Snooker Tour"

Hawkish,W Series' Hawkins spills Bond stunt secrets,2024-09-25,2021-10-02,Siân Price,https://www.bbc.com/sport/motorsport/58725241,"Jess Hawkins made her professional motorsport debut in British Formula Ford at Silverstone in 2014 Iconic car chases and stunts are synonymous with James Bond films. One of the stunt drivers in the latest, No Time To Die, is W Series driver Jess Hawkins.  Hawkins, 26, from Poole, drove a Land Rover Defender in a frantic chase scene. ""I'm part of this big three-car jump and we jumped 85ft across and 12ft high in the air,"" Hawkins said. ""When I hit the ramp all I could see was the sky and no ground, and we then repeated it seven or eight times, each time driving harder and faster. ""I only got scared when I was already committed to the jump, but once I'd done the first one and I realised it wasn't the horrible crash-landing I thought it could be, I wasn't scared at all really."" And when not stunt driving, Hawkins races in the 2021 W Series championship, which is racing alongside F1 this year. Hawkins has been part of the female-only championship since its inception in 2019 and is currently 10th in the standings with two races left in 2021.  ""I've had a tough start to the season, which I was anticipating as it had been so long since I've been racing due to the coronavirus pandemic, and it's a really competitive championship,"" she said. Originally the season finale was due to be in Mexico, but the series will now conclude with a double-header at the Circuit of the Americas on 23 and 24 October in Austin, Texas, after F1 changed the date of the 2021 Mexican Grand Prix. Hawkins' results have improved as the season has progressed - she finished sixth at Spa and fifth at Zandvoort - and she is aiming to end on a high. ""I'm going for a podium. With the progress shown over the last two races, I think it's achievable,"" she said.  ""I need a strong end to the season. There's absolutely no substitute for seat time and as the season goes on I'm getting more seat time. Whilst I'm growing in experience, I'm also growing in confidence and I'll carry the confidence into the final two rounds. "" The races in the United States will be the series' first outside Europe and Hawkins is excited about the prospect of a wider audience. ""We are at the pinnacle of motorsport on the F1 stage and it opens up a whole new world who may not know we existed. ""W Series has been the driving force behind encouraging females to get into motorsport and it has made it clear it's not a male-only place and females are welcome too,"" she added. Hawkins also has a new role as a driver ambassador for the Aston Martin F1 team, where she will be starting simulator racing with them after the W Series season ends. As much as Hawkins enjoyed working as a stunt driver, her passion is racing and she is already thinking about next season. ""I am hoping to be back in W Series and I'd really like to do the British Touring Car Championship - that's where my heart lies so I will try and make it happen.""

Hawkish,Who is Senator John McCain?,2024-09-25,2017-07-20,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40666269,"A war hero, a political maverick, and one of President Trump's fiercest Republican critics - Senator John McCain, 81, has been granted all these titles over the years. Known in Washington for his doggedness and common-sense conservatism, he beat off younger rivals to secure the Republican party's nomination for president in 2008. As a US Navy pilot, Mr McCain narrowly escaped death in July 1967 when a missile exploded near his fuel tanks, sparking a ship fire that left 134 troops dead. Three months later he was shot down over Vietnam, where he spent five years as a prisoner of war. The son of a four-star admiral, he was offered early release due to his father's prominence - but rejected it. Instead, he endured repeated beatings and torture, including two years in solitary confinement. The six-term senator now faces another grave battle, after being diagnosed with brain cancer.  Mr McCain had surgery to remove a blood clot from near his left eye on 14 July, and was found to have an aggressive form of brain tumour known as glioblastoma.   Well-wishes from across the political divide saw four former presidents praise his tenacity, with President Trump sending his ""thoughts and prayers"", and Barack Obama - his rival for the presidency in 2008 - commenting, ""John McCain is an American hero... Cancer doesn't know what it's up against."" Mr McCain stayed in the armed forces after his return to the US, ultimately acting as naval liaison to the Senate until his retirement in 1981. It was at this point that he moved to Arizona to embark on a political career, winning a congressional seat in 1982 and securing a Senate seat four years later. Running against George W Bush for the 2000 presidential nomination, Mr McCain's direct style won him initial support and he secured a surprise victory in the New Hampshire primary. But he was hit by a number of attacks as campaigning turned increasingly negative, and later fell out with influential members of the so-called ""religious right"". The choice of Christian conservative Sarah Palin as running mate for his 2008 presidential campaign was designed to win over such Republicans.  Mr McCain has never been afraid to adopt a controversial position - especially since Donald Trump's emergence in politics. Though he has since hardened some of his views, he has previously attracted the ire of social conservatives for his relatively moderate views on civil unions, abortion and immigration reform. He was one of the Iraq war's strongest supporters, and backed the troop increase there known as the ""surge"". As chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee he has been a vocal - and hawkish - force in foreign policy and military affairs. While battling Mr Obama for the White House, Mr McCain stressed his own experience in these areas and argued that he would make a far better commander-in-chief. The Arizona Senator has repeatedly criticised President Trump's warming relations with Russia, and spent New Year's Eve 2016 with Ukrainian Marines. ""We stand w/them in their fight against #Putin's aggression,"" he tweeted then. Mr McCain withdrew his support for Mr Trump - then his party's presidential nominee - in October 2016, the day after a 2005 recording emerged of him making obscene remarks about women and appearing to trivialise sexual assault. ""When Mr Trump attacks women and demeans the women in our nation and in our society, that is a point where I just have to part company,"" he said. In July 2017, he told CBS's Face the Nation that Russian President Vladimir Putin ""got away with"" trying to change the result of the 2016 US presidential election. The Republican elder has repeatedly shown himself willing to work with Democrats or vote against his party on ideological grounds, including when he voted to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and against George W Bush's tax cuts.  He co-sponsored a bipartisan immigration bill in 2007 which, had it passed, would have offered an amnesty to illegal immigrants as well as tougher border controls. And he was the author, with Democrat Senator Russ Feingold, of a major campaign finance reform in 2002 intended to reduce the influence of money and pressure groups in US elections. He has criticised President Trump's refugee travel ban, saying it betrays American values and ""in some areas, will give Isis [Islamic State] some more propaganda"". When news broke of the president's confrontational first phone call with Australia's Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, Mr McCain phoned Australia's US ambassador, Joe Hockey, to express ""unwavering support"" for the countries' relationship.   In 2017, Mr McCain travelled to war-torn Syria to visit US forces deployed there. He called the Trump administration's decision not to prioritise ending the Syrian civil war ""another disgraceful chapter in American history"". As reports emerged of his cancer diagnosis in summer 2017, the senator's office said he was ""in good spirits as he continues to recover at home with his family"". But news a year later that he had discontinued medical treatment suggested the old granite-faced warrior had lost his last battle, and left the political world in mourning."

The 5km (3.1 miles) route will run from near Kingsteignton to Teignmouth and be accessible to walkers, cyclists and mobility scooter and wheelchair users. The scheme will improve biodiversity, with the creation of hedgerows and woodland, the council has said. There will also be viewing points on the route, as reported by the Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS). The first section between Town Quay, Newton Abbot and Kingsteignton opened in March 2013, followed by the route eastwards linking Newton Abbot Racecourse to the Passage House Inn five years later. Councillor Stuart Hughes, cabinet member with responsibility for cycling, said delivering the Teign Estuary Trail had been an ambition of the council for many years. ""It is a project for which we've been able to attract significant local support,"" he said. ""A huge number of residents, cycle enthusiasts, walkers, business owners and visitors to the area have been flagging up significant need for the delivery of this route."" A public consultation ""demonstrated overwhelming support for the proposals from 92 per cent of respondents"" with the planning application receiving just one objection, he added.

Hawkish,Eight ways the 2018 Oscars will be different,2024-09-25,2018-03-04,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-43168088,"""And the winner is... La La Land!""  Somehow, that moment - and the subsequent revelation that Moonlight had, in fact, won the Oscar for best picture was a whole year ago. But an awful lot can change in Hollywood in a single year.  Here are eight things that will be different about the 90th Academy Awards - and what to look out for at Sunday's ceremony.  Expect envelope jokes. Lots of them. That said, host Jimmy Kimmel already got a few quips out of the way in the trailer for this year's show, co-starring with Warren Beatty, who was handed the wrong envelope at last year's ceremony.  PricewaterhouseCoopers, the accounting firm which has been in charge of counting Oscar votes (and looking after those all-important envelopes) for the past 84 years is, perhaps unsurprisingly, making a few changes.  It's traditional for the previous year's best actor winner to announce who has won best actress - and vice versa.  But Casey Affleck, who won the award for Manchester by the Sea, has pulled out of presenting duties.  He was sued by two female crew members for alleged sexual harassment in 2010. Affleck denied the allegations, and the lawsuits were settled out of court.  The best actress winner will instead be announced by former winners Jodie Foster and Jennifer Lawrence.  A diverse line-up of presenters has been chosen to actually hand out the Oscars. They include Tiffany Haddish, Gina Rodriguez, Lin-Manuel Miranda and Lupita Nyong'o.  And Daniela Vega is also making history. She is believed to be the first openly transgender actress to present at the Academy Awards. Vega is the star of Chile's best foreign film nominee A Fantastic Woman.  Others presenting include Jodie Foster, Mark Hamill, Greta Gerwig, Helen Mirren, Tom Holland, Gal Gadot, Laura Dern and Zendaya.  Women are still under-represented amongst the Oscar nominees, but some important steps have been made.  Rachel Morrison has become the first woman to ever (yes, ever) be nominated as best cinematographer. She's honoured for her work on Dee Rees' Mudbound, which starred Carey Mulligan and Mary J Blige.  And then there's the fact that Greta Gerwig is the fifth woman to ever (yes, ever) be nominated in the best director category, for her debut Lady Bird.  Several films in the best picture category are notable too for being centred around women, without romance being the main focus of the plot. That includes films like Lady Bird, a coming of age story set in early 2000s Sacramento, and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, about a grieving mother's fight for justice.  The first Academy Awards were held on 16 May, 1929 - but two nominees for the 2018 Oscars were born the previous year. James Ivory, nominated for best adapted screenplay for Call Me By Your Name, was born on 7 June, 1928 and Agnes Varda, nominated for best documentary for Faces Places, on 30 May, 1928.  If either wins, they will also be the oldest-ever Oscar winners.  It's worth noting, too, that best supporting actor nominee Christopher Plummer, given a nod for his role in All the Money in the World, is the oldest ever actor nominated for a competitive award.  At the time of writing, it's not expected that there will be a Golden Globes-style black out on the red carpet  - with everyone wearing monochromatic outfits.  But it's likely the massive political earthquake that has hit Hollywood in the past year will be represented not just on the red carpet but throughout the ceremony.  Stars will potentially arrive holding white roses - as happened at the Grammys and Brit Awards. Watch out, too, for celebrities bringing activists as their guests on the red carpet, rather than their significant other (or their mum).  This is what happened at the Globes, with Emma Watson among those using their moment in the spotlight to make a stand against sexual harassment.  It's been suggested that Harvey Weinstein is the most thanked man in Oscars history, with several best actor and actress winners through the years giving him a name check. His firm was also responsible for best picture winners like Shakespeare in Love and The King's Speech.  And just as his presence has been very much felt in previous years, so will his absence this year, after the sexual abuse scandal that erupted at the end of 2017. (Weinstein has denied all accusations of non-consensual sex).  Oscars host Jimmy Kimmel may - or may not - choose to address the issue in his opening monologue. If he does, he'd be following Globes host Seth Meyers who tackled what he called ""the elephant not in the room"" at the January ceremony.  Which makes guessing who's going to win a little bit trickier.  At the moment, it seems to be a two-horse race between The Shape of Water and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri for the best picture title. But the experts' opinion on who's going to win seems to change every day.  There are also murmurings that Get Out, starring British actor Daniel Kaluuya, is gathering momentum. Then again, some think Dunkirk could be the shock winner. It's also notable that the nominated films have had the lowest grosses in six years. Some have suggested this represents a growing gap between what the movie-going public actually watches, and what wins the gongs.  One last thing to mention: This year's ceremony is later than usual, due to the Winter Olympics. It's being held at Hollywood's Dolby Theatre on Sunday, 4 March, starting at 17:00 local time.

However, the left-hander missed a string of good chances to extend his lead further and O'Sullivan, who has not won the title for seven years, pounced in typical predatory fashion to progress. Fine breaks of 77 and 60 allowed him to close out the match in style as he moved within two wins of the £250,000 first prize. ""That's the most awful standard of snooker,"" added O'Sullivan. ""I just said to Barry at the end: 'Sorry mate.' ""I've just got this ability with certain players where if I play bad, then they play even worse.  ""Some of the other guys will punish me, but I've just had it all through my life."" Hawkins was hammered 10-1 by O'Sullivan when the pair met in the 2017 Masters final and he had not beat him since the 2016 World Championship in Sheffield. His record of just three wins from 20 meetings between the pair didn't bode well - and so it proved as O'Sullivan, by no means at his best, registered yet another victory. ""I let him [Ronnie] off the hook - I had enough chances,"" said Hawkins. ""For some reason your mind wanders when you play Ronnie. I've got no complaints.""

In the end he did a good job. It always feels like Ronnie wants to entertain, but I don't think that's really the most important thing.  He'll probably feel he's let people down, but in the end he finished the job - and that's all that matters. But Barry Hawkins will be going back to his dressing room and saying: ""I had so many chances - and I threw them all away."" Murphy, the 2015 Masters champion, made his experience count as he beat Lisowski in commanding fashion to reach the semi-finals for the first time in four years. Breaks of 75, 131 and 76 allowed Murphy to take a 3-1 mid-session lead. A second century of the evening, this time 123, helped make it 5-1 as the former world champion moved within one frame of victory. Lisowski, who reached his first Masters semi-final last season, rallied to win the next two frames.  However, Murphy stood firm as he booked his place in a sixth Masters semi-final. ""You just never feel safe against Jack because he's a huge talent,"" Murphy told BBC Sport. ""When you play in front of a crowd like this, how can you not feel good?""  A deflated Lisowski said: ""I didn't feel great, but I just kept clinging on. Shaun finished strongly.""

Hawkish,Company fined after worker crushed by truck,2024-09-25,2023-12-22,Richard Price,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0wyz3rzrkro,"A company where a worker was crushed to death between vehicles has been fined. Shane Smithyman was working at Hawkins Logistics, Staffordshire, in November 2019 when the truck he was operating became uncoupled. Investigators found the vehicle was not properly maintained and there was a poor safety culture at the firm. At Telford Magistrates' Court, the company admitted failing to ensure the health, safety and welfare of its employees and was fined £866,000. At Thursday's hearing, the company was also ordered to pay costs of more than £50,000. Mr Smithyman died in hospital a few days after the incident on 22 November as a result of his injuries. Laura Nichols, who led the investigation for Cannock Chase Council, said there had been no safe system of work in place for the task Mr Smithyman had been doing. She added training and supervision had been inadequate and the Rugeley-based company had previously failed to act on the advice of external consultants. Councillor Andrea Muckley said: “This is a tragic case. Transport operations are among the highest risk workplace activities. “Had the necessary risk assessments been undertaken by the company, the circumstances that led to this fatality would have been anticipated and avoided.” She said injuries on vehicle runways were one of the highest causes of death in the transport industry and it was vital operators had safety measures in place to protect employees.

Hawkish,Hawkins still has Wales World Cup ambitions,2024-09-25,2023-12-21,Brent Pilnick,https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-union/67773766,"Joe Hawkins was ruled ineligible for Wales after his summer move to Exeter Centre Joe Hawkins is confident he will play for Wales at a future World Cup after missing this year's event due to his move to Premiership side Exeter.  Hawkins, who has won five caps, was deemed ineligible for his country after moving to Exeter from Ospreys as he had not played for Wales at least 25 times.  The 21-year-old has played 12 times for Exeter since his summer move to Devon. ""Obviously you give a thought to it, a World Cup is a huge achievement for anyone in their career,"" he said. ""I guess I just thought the five caps I've got, hopefully one day I'll get to represent Wales again. ""But the five caps I've got can never be taken away from me, I've got them forever, and I just thought that coming down here and being in the Premiership was the best opportunity to fully fulfil my potential at this point in my career.  Exeter expect rapid progress from Hawkins ""Times have been quite tough in Wales over the last year, so I put my personal development first, I felt, in coming here, both on and off the field. ""It's my first time living away from home, being fully independent, that's growth as a person as well as a player, so that was a big thought in my decision. ""There'll hopefully be another two or three World Cups while my career's going on, and depending on rules and stuff I've got the potential to maybe play in a couple."" Wales' eligibility criteria also led to the situation whereby Exeter team-mates Dafydd Jenkins and Christ Tshiunza are eligible to play for the national team as they joined the Chiefs before winning their first caps while Hawkins has to stay at home.  But Hawkins does not appear in any way bitter at the fact that he was left to watch Wales on television at the World Cup while his club colleagues were there in France.  Joe Hawkins won the last of his five Wales caps against Italy in March ""I was enjoying watching the boys, it was nice to see Christ and Daf out there representing the country, so I'm really happy for all the boys and really happy for how well the boys went as well,"" said Hawkins. ""It was a tough Six Nations, but to come together like they did and put in a decent World Cup campaign was amazing to watch. ""Coming down to Exeter, I was just focusing on my rugby here at the time, getting integrated into the squad, trying to play some good rugby in the pre-season Premiership Rugby Cup block ready to hit the Premiership."" He added: ""I'm just enjoying being here with Daf and Christ playing, we're mates and when they go off to Six Nations and World Cups and whatever it's just really good for them."" Hawkins (right) helped Exeter to a memorable Investec Champions Cup victory at Toulon earlier this month Exeter have had an inconsistent start to the Premiership season but impressed in the Investec Champions Cup over the past two weeks. A dramatic late win at three-times champions Toulon was backed up by a come-from-behind victory at home to Munster last week, to put Exeter in a strong position to go on and claim a seeded place in the last 16.  The wins have given Hawkins and his young team-mates something to build on as a new-look Exeter side try to return to challenging for Premiership honours. ""As young players it's finding that consistency and that's what we're trying to do,"" he said. ""We've had a couple of hiccups in the Premiership, but I think that's normal for the transition that we're going through. ""These Champions Cup wins, they don't change our goals or expectations, it probably just gives us a bit of confidence that we know that we can mix it with the best sides and just stay in the fight as well. ""If you look at a lot of our games we've won in the last 20 minutes, so it shows we're fit and it shows that the boys don't ever give up.""

Hawkish,Hawkins aims for improvement in London,2024-09-25,2017-02-25,Kheredine Idessane,https://www.bbc.com/sport/scotland/39092921,"Hawkins was a comfortable winner in the men's event at a muddy Callendar Park National cross-country champion Callum Hawkins says athletics in Scotland has come on ""leaps and bounds"" and aims to improve on his ninth place finish in the Rio Olympics marathon at this summer's World Championships in London. Hawkins, the pre-race favourite over the 10km course at Falkirk's Callendar Park, broke away on the first of three laps to win very comfortably. Chris Jones of Dundee Hawkhill was second ahead of Shettleston's Lachlan Oates. It was Hawkins' second success at an event that has also been won by big brother Derek. Both are coached by father Robert, and the younger sibling, still spattered in mud as he signed autographs for fans waiting at the finish-line, reflected on the overall feel-good factor in Scotland. ""We had 15 Scots at the Olympics. And that, at least in my lifetime, is unheard of. And now Laura Muir, Andrew Butchart and myself - running the kind of times we are - it's just a snowball.  ""Everyone is just bouncing off each other and it's just great for the sport in Scotland."" The next target for Hawkins is the New York half-marathon on 19 March, then the focus switches to London in August. ""Hopefully I can improve on what I did in Rio,"" he said. Some of the runners cooling off in Falkirk Hawkins' win was the final act in a frenetic day in Falkirk, where well over 2,000 athletes splashed their way around a sometimes sodden track in all the various age-group races.  There was a fine victory in the main women's event for Morag MacLarty, who says making it into next year's Scottish Commonwealth Games team could be tougher than the trials for Rio.  It was a first senior cross-country title for the 31-year-old Central AC athlete, who won with a fine piece of front running to see off the defending champion, and Rio Olympian, Beth Potter. Lothian's Sarah Inglis took the bronze medal. ""I'm very injury-prone,"" said MacLarty. ""My physio just identified a leg-length difference and she's been amazing. She's keeping me in one piece so I've been able to get a few months' consistent training which I've never had for as long as I can remember so I'm excited to see what I can do if I keep myself in one piece.  ""Getting in the Scottish team for the 2018 Commonwealth Games in the Gold Coast is going be crazy. The Scottish team is so strong, if you're looking at the 5,000m for women. So I don't know; I'm going to have to see what event I'm going to go for first . It will be a bit of a tall order."""

Hawkish,The descendants of Alexander the Great?,2024-09-25,2018-08-22,Mehk Chakraborty,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20180821-malana-a-himalayan-village-shrouded-in-myth,"If you look beyond the hashish haze, you’ll find a treasure trove of legends, intrigue and unanswered questions. Our Unique World Our Unique World explores distinctive subcultures around the globe in celebration of what makes us different. Check back each week in August and September to discover a new, unique world. India’s Parvati Valley is well known among travellers for its psychedelic parties and free-flowing hashish that originates from the ancient village of Malana in North India’s Himachal Pradesh region. But if you look beyond the haze, you’ll find a treasure trove of legends, intrigue and unanswered questions. Nestled in the peaks of the Himalayas, Malana is surrounded by steep cliffs and snow-capped mountains. Travellers have long been drawn to this village of nearly 1,700 inhabitants, staying for days on end amid the cold gushes of wind and rows of dark green deodar trees to consume what locals consider the holy herb and what outsiders see as a way to free the mind: the famed and award-winning Malana cream. This cannabis resin or hashish is renowned both for the hand rubbing-technique used to produce it and for its reportedly remarkable intoxicating effects. But I’d come to Malana to try to make sense of the myths surrounding the village. You may also be interested in: • The islands with a ‘third gender’ • The people descended from Spartans • Where people speak the Aztec language Legend has it that some of Alexander the Great’s army took shelter in this isolated village in 326BC after they were wounded in a battle against Porus, a ruler in India’s Punjab region. These soldiers are often said to be the ancestors of the Malani people. Artefacts from that period have been found in the village, such as a sword that reportedly rests inside the temple. However, genetic ties to the soldiers have not been studied or established. In fact, many of the locals I spoke to had no idea where this myth originated. “The big claim that Malani people have descended from Alexander the Great’s army has become a widely accepted truth, but I have not found any real backing to it. There are some weapons and other things that can be found that have raised these links, but I am certain that there is no evidence to this story,” said Amlan Datta, a filmmaker who has spent a decade working in Malana. But these theories are fuelled by locals’ noticeably different physical features and their language, which are unlike that of any other local tribe, adding to the enigma surrounding the Malanis and their identity. They speak Kanashi, which is considered sacred and is not taught to outsiders. It is also spoken nowhere else in the world. During my visit, I referred to some of the men I met as ‘Bhaiji’ (a polite way of saying brother), which is a fairly common way to address men in Himachal. Though locals understood when I spoke to them in Hindi, their responses in Kanashi were incomprehensible to me. A study of Kanashi is currently being undertaken by Uppsala University in Sweden, led by professor of linguistics, Anju Saxena. “Kanashi qualifies as a definitely endangered, as an unwritten and almost undescribed language,” Saxena told me. “It belongs to the Sino-Tibetan language family, and in all the surrounding villages, Indo-Aryan languages are spoken, which are completely unrelated to Kanashi. This raises interesting questions concerning its prehistory and its linguistic structure.” Even getting to Malana was a journey into the unknown. There are no motorable roads to the village, and it took me about four hours to trek there from the village of Jari at the bottom of the Parvati Valley. The approach was steep yet breath-taking. It wasn’t long before I started passing Malani people – distinguishable by their light brown hair, light brown eyes, long noses and a distinct wheatish or a golden-brownish complexion of skin – most of whom were traditionally dressed in light brown robes, caps and hemp shoes. To me, they looked more Mediterranean than Himachali. As I entered the village, I came to a group of teenagers who casually inquired whether I was interested in buying some hashish. Though cannabis has long been the backbone of this small village’s economy, it has led to a host of socio-cultural issues, such as young children being involved in the drug trade. This is perhaps why, one year ago, the village deity Jamdagni Rishi – who is locally nicknamed the Jamlu Devta and is a great sage in Hindu mythology – decreed through his spiritual spokesperson (the Gur) that all guesthouses across the village would be shut, leaving the village open to outsiders only during the day. Jamlu Devta is an important figurehead in village governance, a political set-up that has long baffled researchers and visitors who cannot comprehend how such an advanced form of governance exists in this quaint and remote Himalayan village. Malana’s unique democratic system is said to be among the oldest in the world, and, similar to the Ancient Greek system of democracy, it consists of a lower house and upper house. However, it has a uniquely spiritual twist to it: ultimate rulings rest on the upper court, which includes three important figures, of which one is the representative of the local deity, Jamlu Devta. “Devta is the ultimate word and we have a set-up of a council and three political figures of sorts, one of whom – the Gur, or the vessel who is possessed by Jamlu – communicates to us the decisions of Jamlu Devta,” explained Rohan, one of the hashish-dealing teenagers. Datta had told me about a local legend that said Jamlu Devta once inhabited Malana, which he was gifted by the Hindu god Shiva. There are two temples in the village, one dedicated to him and the other, to his wife, Renuka Devi. As I walked through the narrow passageways of this ancient village, dotted with wooden and brick houses, I entered the large courtyard, where the lower court gathers, and a temple dedicated to Jamlu Devta. It was sight to behold against a backdrop of snow-capped mountains. The temple, with wide wooden pillars, intricate doors and a host of bones, skulls and other sacrificial animal parts on one wall looked intriguing. But there was a warning sign outside demanding INR 3,500 ‘On touching of this holy place of Jamdagni Rishi’. This sign is an outward demonstration of another tradition that is very apparent in Malana: a quest to preserve the ‘purity’ of the village. People across Himachal Pradesh will tell you that the Malanis are known to restrict contact with outsiders, particularly in terms of direct physical contact. I personally had been warned to keep my distance by the driver who had brought me to Jari earlier that day. Although I did see some of the younger generations hugging or shaking hands, most people here still strongly hold the taboo of touching outsiders. When I went to pay for a bottle of water, the shopkeeper asked me to leave the notes on the counter instead of handing them to him directly. I also learned that marriages must take place within the village; transgression of this norm invites social boycott. Well aware that outsiders aren’t welcome here, I felt like an intruder as I kept probing people to find out more information about the village. Himachali people in general are warm and chatty, and they love to share stories and meals with visitors; in Malana, however, long conversations with locals were rare. Descending from the hills and coming down from this otherworld, I acknowledged my position as a traveller who would forever be on the outside of this mysterious Himalayan hamlet. Whether I liked it or not, the locals hadn’t taken me in, and I needed to respect their culture. But now, weeks later, as I look back on my quest to unfold the legends of Malana, I have come to the realisation that the very beauty of my experience was based on the essence of mystery, the unknown. Cherishing that very quality of Malana finally has led me to a newfound appreciation of this strange, cold land of enigmatic people.

Hawkish,Why tyrants love to write poetry,2024-09-25,2017-10-25,Benjamin Ramm,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20171025-why-tyrants-love-to-write-poetry,"Nero, Stalin and Bin Laden were all fans, but what makes verse so appealing to these leaders? Benjamin Ramm explores the connection between ruthlessness and sentimentality. Poetry is an art of refinement, synonymous with delicacy and sensitivity. It seems counterintuitive that it might also be a celebration of brutality, and the art form beloved of tyrants. But from classical antiquity to modernity, dictators have been inspired to write verse – seeking solace, intimacy, or glory. Their work informs us about the nature of power, the abiding appeal of poetry, and the perils of artistic interpretation. The archetype of the poet-tyrant is Roman emperor Nero (37-68 CE), the vain, self-pitying exhibitionist whose debased rule mirrored his deficient art. Nero’s historiographers, Tacitus and Suetonius, suggest that Rome was as tormented by his poetry as by his policies. Derision is a satisfying form of critical revenge, but these accounts raise a troubling question: would the tyrant’s crimes be mitigated were his art deemed to have merit; and conversely, can we judge fairly the quality of a tyrant’s poetry? -       The lost Arab poetry that lives on in Hebrew -       The words that can make us calmer -       The writers who defied Soviet censors As the scholar Ulrich Gotter points out in the recently published volume Tyrants Writing Poetry, in comparison to poet-emperors Caesar and Augustus, Nero’s reign was ""remarkably bloodless"". Yet despite his lack of military ambition, Nero’s vengeful deeds were high-profile, and our image of him is of a pathetic despot, wearing a tragic stage costume, singing of the capture of Troy while his imperial city burned to the ground; Suetonius quotes Nero as “being greatly delighted with the beauty of the flames”. Nero revelled in performance: in Rome he inaugurated an elaborate Hellenic-inspired festival, the Neronia, and during a tour of Greece he participated in competitions of poetry, song and lyre-playing, as well as charioteering. (At Olympia, he was thrown from his 10-horse chariot but was still crowned the winner by fawning, fearful judges). Nero insisted that the statues of previous winners be ripped off their pedestals, and he returned to Rome with 1,808 prizes. This portrait of the poet as megalomaniac, forging the world from his delusional imagination, provided inspiration for artists such as the Marquis de Sade and the Nobel prize-winning author Henryk Sienkiewicz, whose 1896 novel Quo Vadis became an iconic Technicolor film starring Peter Ustinov. Nero even sought to choreograph his final performance – his own botched suicide. He rehearsed and performed his farewell phrase: qualis artifex pereo (“what an artist dies with me”). ‘The magic power of the spoken word’    Almost two thousand years later, a group of Italian poets prefigured fascism with a Neronian celebration of the spectacle of destruction. ‘Let art flourish, though the world perish’ was one of the slogans of the Italian Futurists, founded by poet Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, who fetishised war as ‘the only cure for the world’. Marinetti sought to industrialise and militarise language with ‘concrete poetry’, written by a creator-aggressor who would ‘begin by brutally destroying syntax’. The Futurists had been influenced by poet-warrior Gabriele D’Annunzio, a revered figure who set up a short-lived ‘lyrical dictatorship’ in 1919, which inspired Mussolini’s seizure of power three years later. Despite professing enthusiasm for D’Annunzio’s ‘mystical union’ of poet and people, Mussolini’s own verse was prone to mawkish resignation. There was a degree of pretence in his literary ambition: his biographer Richard Bosworth notes that Mussolini left the works of eminent poets “ostentatiously open on his desk when being visited by foreign dignitaries”. His later poetry reflected his isolation, far from the idealism of his socialist youth, which produced verses that lamented the fall of Jacobinism (“the axe bloodied in plebeian veins”) and yearned for revolutionary prophecy (“In his dying eyes flashed the Idea, / The vision of centuries to come”). Inevitably, dictators channel their artistic disappointments into politics. Hitler, despite proclaiming a preference for ‘the magic power of the spoken word’ against ‘the syrupy effusions of aesthetic litterateurs’, once imagined himself a Viennese bohemian. Goebbels, who perfected the art form of propaganda, wrote a novel with expressionistic traits, while Pol Pot, educated in Paris, was an admirer of Verlaine’s Symbolist poetry. Russian Marxism initiated a wave of radical aesthetic movements, but the poet-tyrant of the Soviet Union wrote in a strikingly conservative style. The young Stalin composed poetry in Georgian – a language banned at the Orthodox seminary where he trained – and his work reproduces romantic motifs, of the rebellious poet and the lost Golden Age. Stalin’s verses are characterised by artful imitation, a lack of self-irony, and “exaggerated ardour”, according to critic Evgeny Dobrenko. With an ornamental elegance bordering on kitsch, Stalin’s poetry brims with naturalistic clichés: “under a grove in the azure rings the warble of a nightingale”, as the soul is tormented by “the dark forest of the night”. It is earnest, if politically crude: Know for certain that once  Struck down to the ground, an oppressed man  Strives again to reach the pure mountain,  When exalted by hope. In Over This Land (1895), an artist bestows revelatory music to the masses: The voice made many a man’s heart  Beat, that had been turned to stone;  It enlightened many a man’s mind  Which had been cast into uttermost darkness. But the prophet is unrecognised by those he seeks to liberate: “The mob set before the outcast / A vessel filled with poison”. Stalin reappears as a singer in a later poem, “moved to tears by the bitter lot of the peasant”, as he – with foresight – “erected a monument to himself… in the heart of every Georgian”. Published anonymously, Stalin’s poetry featured in prestigious literary journals and was anthologised as an exemplar of Georgian classical literature. Indeed, even Stalin’s most critical biographers have praise for his verses: Simon Sebag-Montefiore wrote that “their beauty lies in the rhythm and language” (difficult to convey in translation), while Robert Service claims that the work possesses “a linguistic purity recognised by all”. Its decorative prettiness and heroic posturing would reappear in Stalin’s championing of socialist realism, against an experimental modernist avant-garde. Pen and sword Stalin’s spiritual heir, Yuri Andropov, combined the bureaucratic with the romantic. As head of the KGB, he persecuted dissidents and crushed the Hungarian uprising, while writing love poems to his wife. (The ability to compartmentalise is an essential trait of the creator-dictator). The Uzbek poet Hamid Ismailov tells a revealing anecdote of Andropov: one of his speechwriters sent him a birthday card, in which he joked that power corrupts people, to which Andropov replied with a chilling verse: Once a villain blurted out  that power corrupts people.  Now all pundits repeat it  For so many years  Without noticing (alas!)  That more often people corrupt the power. Another avowed Stalinist, the North Korean leader Kim Il-sung, was attributed the authorship of revolutionary plays and theoretical work, most notably ‘seed theory’, which presents Kim as the sire of artistic invention. In 1992, Kim Sr wrote a public poem to his son, Jong-il: Can it be the Shining Star’s fiftieth birthday already? Admired by all for his power of pen and sword  Combined with his loyal and filial mind,  And unanimous praise and cheers shake heaven and earth. Kim, father of the nation, was heralded as the ‘Sun of the Nation’, in the manner of Mao Zedong (‘the Red Sun in our Hearts’). It is Mao who embodied the pen-and-sword ideal of a ruler, based on a unity of cultural ability (wen) with martial prowess (wu). Mao sought to appropriate the imperial tradition while transcending it, noting in a 1936 poem that few emperors had left a literary legacy: now “truly great men / Look to this age alone”. Mao’s poetry is orthodox in form and classical in theme, a performance of the tradition he purported to despise. Despite his own injunction to destroy the Four Olds (culture, customs, habits, ideas), Mao wrote in the old style, even when it had been denounced as elitist and outdated. “I feared the spread of such errors could lead the youth astray”, confided Mao to a magazine editor, but he indulged his own tastes nonetheless, even as he forbade others. Mao luxuriated in language, proving adept with imagery (“The rolling hills sea-blue, / The dying sun blood-red”) and classical themes (“Man’s world is mutable, seas become mulberry fields”), in turns epigrammatic (“Bitter sacrifice strengthens bold resolve”) and propagandistic (“China’s daughters have high-aspiring minds, / They love their battle-array, not silks and satins”). Mao’s work is proof that artistic refinement is no guarantee of a gentler politics. In 1966, Red Guards supplemented their Little Red Book with a collection of 25 poems attributed to Mao, which led to an enthusiasm for old style verses among those dedicated to destroying “feudal relics”. The last line that Mao ever wrote, a year before launching the Cultural Revolution, was a premonition of the coming tumult: “Look, the world is being turned upside down”. ‘Censor and creator’ Poetry has been entered as incriminating evidence at the International Criminal Court, where Radovan Karadžić, the ‘Butcher of Bosnia’, was found guilty of genocide. A 1992 BBC documentary captured a meeting between Karadžić and the nationalist Russian poet Eduard Limonov, in which Karadžić recites a poem that prophesies violence and Limonov fires a volley of bullets into the valley below. Karadžić claims to have anticipated the battle years beforehand, and his 1971 poem Sarajevo contains the lines: The town burns like a piece of incense  In the smoke rumbles our consciousness… I know that all of these are the preparations of the scream:  What does the black metal in the garage have for us? Establishing intention on the part of a perpetrator is a requirement under international law. Karadžić was a key figure in what Slavoj Žižek terms the ‘poetic-military complex’, which venerated the literary canon of nationalism, particularly Petar Petrović-Njegoš’ epic poem The Mountain Wreath (1847), in which the shedding of Muslim blood is presented as an act of baptism for the Serb nation. The rhetoric of genocide is cloaked in anodyne metaphor: a nation ‘purified’ through ‘ethnic cleansing’. Yet readers must also be aware of the perils of treating an artistic persona as the author’s own. Consider the work of Ayatollah Khomeini, whose Persian poetry channels the spirit of Sufi seers Rumi and Hafez: I am a supplicant for a goblet of wine  from the hand of a sweetheart.  In whom can I confide this secret of mine?  Where can I take this sorrow? These lyrics are difficult to reconcile with Khomeini’s public persona: I have become imprisoned, O beloved, by the mole on your lip!   I saw your ailing eyes and became ill through love… Open the door of the tavern and let us go there day and night,   For I am sick and tired of the mosque and seminary.    The ayatollah’s devotees are keen to read these verses strictly allegorically (‘The mosque and the preacher are the empty display of outward religiosity’) – although some lines are difficult to neuter: “I have torn off the garb of asceticism and hypocrisy”. The poems reveal the ayatollah as a mystic, albeit one who can issue a fatwa, making him both censor and creator. The raid on Osama bin Laden’s compound in 2011 prompted media commentary about his bookshelf, focusing on the absence of fiction and neglecting to mention his fondness for poetry. In 2010, bin Laden wrote to a lieutenant with details of an ambitious plot, before adding a request: “if there are any brothers with you who know about poetic metres, please inform me, and if you have any books on the science of classical prosody, please send them to me”. Bin Laden was among the most celebrated jihadi poets, and his status derived in part from his mastery of classical eloquence. Bin Laden’s emir in Iraq, Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi, was known simultaneously as ‘the butcher’ and ‘he who weeps a lot’ – illuminating the link between ruthlessness and sentimentality, the twin desire for power and pity. Al-Qaeda’s current leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri, also writes poetry, and the self-proclaimed caliph of so-called Islamic State, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, wrote his PhD thesis on a religious poem. One tyrant who wrote poetry to the bitter end was Saddam Hussein. His 2013 prison poem is composed in a clumsy vernacular: “You are the soothing breeze / My soul is made fresh by you / And our Baath Party blossoms like a branch turns green”. Saddam, who liked to pose with a Kalashnikov, exhibits his trademark defiance: “Here we unveil our chests to the wolves”. Intriguingly, the man who invented the rifle, Mikhail Kalashnikov, himself wanted to be a poet. As WH Auden wrote in an epitaph of Hitler, “the poetry he invented was easy to understand”.

Hawkish,Churchill ‘brought to vigorous life’,2024-09-25,2017-11-21,Nicholas Barber,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20171117-film-review-darkest-hour,"Gary Oldman’s portrayal of Winston Churchill in Darkest Hour could put him in contention for an Oscar, writes critic Nicholas Barber. Spoiler alert! In June 1940, a flotilla of civilian boats rescued thousands of British troops from a beach in northern France, and Winston Churchill, one of the men responsible for the rescue, went on to lead Britain to victory against Germany. Actually, maybe it’s not much of a spoiler. However many school history lessons you may have skipped, you probably know that, on balance, Churchill did better than Hitler in World War Two. But Joe Wright’s Darkest Hour is so breathlessly tense that at times you may forget how well the Dunkirk evacuation went. You may even forget the rest of Churchill’s triumphs. In parts of this propulsive, well-appointed and wonderfully acted period drama, his situation is so precarious it doesn’t look as if he’ll last the year, let alone the war. Never mind his battles with Hitler and Mussolini, his battles with politicians in his own party are testing enough. As the massive on-screen captions tell us, the story begins in May 1940, when three million German troops reach the Belgian border. Over in Britain, parliament has lost faith in the terminally ill Conservative prime minister, Neville Chamberlain (Ronald Pickup). Conservative grandees hand the top job to Churchill (Gary Oldman), because he is the only candidate the opposition party will accept. But they have their doubts about following a fat old eccentric whose decisions led to catastrophic losses in the Gallipoli campaign in World War One, and whose blood is now equal parts champagne, whisky and bacon fat. Churchill has barely unpacked his suitcases in 10 Downing Street before Chamberlain and the Earl of Halifax (Stephen Dillane) start plotting to turf him out again. And the more pugnacious his anti-Hitler rhetoric gets, the more certain they are that negotiating with Hitler might not be such a bad idea.  Luckily for Churchill, he has the support of his wide-eyed secretary (Lily James), a working-class angel who informs him that when he does his ‘V for Victory’ hand gesture the wrong way round, it translates as: “Up your bum.” He also has the indefatigable loyalty of his no-nonsense wife Clementine (Kristin Scott Thomas), who – like so many big-screen heroines – is there to give the hero pep talks while tying his bow tie. But Churchill’s idiosyncrasies and stubbornness worry everyone else, up to and including King George VI (an amusingly exasperated Ben Mendelson). When the King proposes that they should schedule their weekly meetings for 4:00 pm, Churchill retorts that that’s impossible: four o’clock is when he takes his nap. While Christopher Nolan’s prodigious Dunkirk dramatised the retreat from France, and ignored all of the planning that preceded it, Darkest Hour does the opposite. Having staged a breathtaking five-minute tracking shot along Dunkirk’s beach in Atonement, Wright may well have felt that he couldn’t possibly top it. And so, there is one brief shot of the legendary ‘little ships’ setting sail from England, and a few glimpses of hellish French battlefields, but the film concentrates on middle-aged men arguing with each other in rooms filled with cigar smoke. Nonetheless, Wright treats his talky political drama as if it were a pulse-pounding action movie. Thanks to Bruno Delbonnel’s flashy camerawork, Valerio Bonelli’s snappy editing and Anthony McCarten’s punchy, funny dialogue, the debates have the impact of explosions, and Churchill’s strolls through his headquarters have the hurtling momentum of a car chase. Unsurprisingly, much of the film’s boisterous energy is generated by its tremendous central performance - as dampened as it is by the leading man’s prosthetic jowls. The result of all that cutting-edge make-up is that Oldman doesn’t look much like himself, but he doesn’t look much like Churchill, either. And yet the actor’s twinkle-eyed gusto brings the prime minister to vigorous life. He is a force of nature who can overflow with anger and guffawing jollity, sometimes within the same sentence, but who can also be paralysed by depression. It’s not a wholly flattering portrayal. What is so clever about the film is that, while we tend to assume that Churchill’s hawkish policies were the right ones, and that his opponents were deluded cowards, Darkest Hour isn’t quite so sure. The hero’s rants about fighting to the last man can seem dangerously fanatical, and Halifax’s measured pleas on behalf of peace talks can seem persuasively sensible. It’s not that you’re ever on Halifax’s side, exactly – Dillane is too smooth and lizardy for that – but you can see why people might not have been on Churchill’s side, either. Towards the end, though, the script’s balance is upset by two clunking scenes. First, there is a late-night bonding session with King George, a cosy tête-à-tête that suggests the royal family saved Britain from the Nazis. Then comes an all-too-convenient meeting with a focus group of cheery cockneys, who assure Churchill that they’re behind him all the way. These hokey sequences, along with a few other clichéd ones, drag Darkest Hour down from a great film to a good one. But there is definitely greatness in the way Oldman takes a role that has already been played by so many actors, and makes it utterly his own. Don’t bet against him flashing that ‘V For Victory’ sign on Oscar night. ★★★★☆  If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.

Hawkish,22 films to watch in 2022,2024-09-25,2022-01-07,Nicholas Barber and Caryn James,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20220106-22-films-to-watch-in-2022,"From a psychological thriller starring Harry Styles and Florence Pugh, to Robert Pattinson as The Batman, and sequels to Avatar and Knives Out, our critics pick the best releases slated for 2022. A Hero With its intentionally ambiguous title, A Hero is a work from one of today's masters, Asghar Farhadi. Two of his most stirring films, A Separation and The Salesman, each won the Oscar for best foreign language film (before the category was renamed), and this latest is shortlisted for this year's award. Once more his characters embody the clash of tradition, morality, politics and a changing society in today's Iran. With Farhadi's usual eloquence and precise, intimate observation, the story follows Rahim, a flawed but hugely sympathetic man imprisoned for debt. When he gets two days' leave and tries to find a way out of that debt, a small act of dishonesty spirals out of control, and the glare of social media enhances his problems. (Caryn James) Released in the US on 7 January Belle This cyberpunk update of Beauty and the Beast received a 14-minute standing ovation when it premiered at last May's Cannes Film Festival – and it's easy to see why. Mamoru Hosoda's dazzling anime is a fairy-tale romance, a high-school soap opera, a superhero action movie and a science-fiction mystery all rolled into one. More than that, the film is a technical marvel in which every frame sparkles with a seemingly infinite array of tiny details. Its heroine is a Japanese schoolgirl who is too shy to sing in real life, but becomes a world-famous pop star in a virtual-reality community. Everyone is desperate to uncover the true identity of her pink-haired, blue-eyed alter ego – and when Belle meets the mysterious, monstrous Beast online, she is desperate to work out who he is, too. (Nicholas Barber) Released on 14 January in the US and Turkey, 20 Jan in Italy, and 4 February in the UK and Spain The Batman Robert Pattinson channels his inner bat in this latest, grammatically precise reboot. It's not Batman, it's The Batman. And if you thought The Dark Knight was a moody guy, think again. Matt Reeves, who co-wrote and directs, told Empire he sees his version of the crime-fighter as a recluse inspired by Kurt Cobain, right down to a grungy, well-worn Batsuit. Pattinson has the right brooding game for this, portraying a hero who is only in his second year of saving Gotham, still finding his way as he takes on the ruthless Riddler (Paul Dano). Colin Farrell, under layers of prosthetics, is The Penguin. But seemingly there will be some humour amid the darkness and violence, going by the comical moment in one of the trailers, when The Batman deadpans to Catwoman (Zoë Kravitz), in his husky, ultra-serious voice, ""You've got a lot of cats."" (CJ) Released internationally on 4 March Everything Everywhere All at Once The directing team known as Daniels (aka Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert) turned eccentricity into an art form in 2016's Swiss Army Man, their droll, blacker-than-black comedy about a flatulent corpse. Their new film, with a title suggesting controlled chaos, leaps into sci-fi. Michelle Yeoh plays a woman whose simple, relatable attempt to finish her taxes takes her across multiple universes, where she may exist as different versions of herself. The cast includes Jamie Lee Curtis as a villainous accountant who gets in her way. The trailer suggests an emotional family story, a martial arts extravaganza and a deserved showcase for Yeoh, all shaped by Daniels' maniacally off-the-chart style. (CJ) Released in the US and Canada on 25 March Turning Red Like Inside Out, Turning Red is a Pixar cartoon about the pains of growing up as a girl, but it is unique in lots of ways: this is Pixar's first film to be directed solely by a woman, the first to be set in Canada, and the first to revolve around a heroine from an Asian family. The heroine in question is Meilin – or Mei – (Rosalie Chiang), a hard-working student who transforms into a huge, shaggy red panda whenever she is stressed. Given that Mei is a 13-year-old Chinese-Canadian, and that the film is set in Toronto in the early-2000s, Turning Red appears to be drawn from the experiences of its writer-director, Domee Shi – except, presumably, for the bit about swelling up into a giant, furry animal. Anyway, Mei looks so sweet and fluffy in the trailer that anyone with small children should place their order for a cuddly red panda toy now. (NB) Released internationally on 11 March Nope At the moment, nothing has been revealed about Nope except that 1: It stars Daniel Kaluuya, Keke Palmer and Steven Yeun; 2: The poster depicts some kind of cloudy flying saucer hovering over a valley town; and 3: the same poster describes it as ""A New Terror from the Mind of Academy Award Winner Jordan Peele"". Still, that information is enough for Nope to be a thrilling prospect. Peele's first two films, Get Out and Us, also had brief titles which didn't give away their stories – and, in fact, the less you knew about the plots in advance, the more riveting they were. But both turned out to be hugely imaginative horror movies that blended hair-raising scares and provocative social commentary. Dare you miss Peele's third big-screen offering? The answer is: Nope. (NB) Released on 22 July The Northman Robert Eggers' small, eerie, psychologically dark stunners have marked him as one of today's most original filmmakers. Anya Taylor-Joy, in her first starring role, was transported to the 16th Century and took on the devil in The Witch (2015), and in The Lighthouse, Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe tangled with each other as isolated 19th-Century lighthouse keepers. The Northman, another period piece, takes Eggers to 10th-Century Viking Iceland, but expands his scope with an epic tale and a large top-rank cast that includes Dafoe, Taylor-Joy, Nicole Kidman, Björk and Ethan Hawke, with Alexander Skarsgård in the lead as a prince out to avenge his father's death. Eggers' vision promises to be as bold and bizarre as ever, with wide-scale action, intense close-ups and Kidman in yet another of her crazy-long wigs. (CJ) Released internationally on 22 April Killers of the Flower Moon The 26th film from Martin Scorsese is his first ever Western – although it does echo some of his previous masterpieces: once again, Scorsese has opted to tell a momentous true story of greed, ambition and brutal crime. Adapted by Eric Roth from the non-fiction book by David Grann, Killers of the Flower Moon examines the murders of several members of the Osage tribe in the 1920s. Robert De Niro plays William Hale, an Oklahoma cattle rancher who covets the oil rights of the Indigenous people, and Leonardo DiCaprio plays Hale's conflicted nephew, who is married to an Osage tribeswoman (Lily Gladstone). Yes, the main attraction here is that we're finally getting to see Scorsese's two favourite leading men together in one of his films. Mind you, Jesse Plemons is sure to match them as Tom White, the FBI agent assigned to the case. (NB) Released in 2022 The Woman King In a year full of powerful women on screen, the two in this 19th-Century historical drama may be the most intriguing. Viola Davis, who has made fierceness her trademark style, plays the leader of a women's military group in the African kingdom of Dahomey (a country now within present-day Benin) and Thuso Mbedu, the electrifying star of The Underground Railroad, is one of her recruits, as they fight threatening colonisers. Lashana Lynch, briefly 007 in No Time to Die, and John Boyega also star in the historical epic. Black Panther proved there's a hunger for African heroes, and director Gina Prince-Bythewood is experienced at both character portraits (the classic relationship film Love and Basketball) and action (the 2020 superhero movie The Old Guard with Charlize Theron). (CJ) Released in the US and Canada on 16 September Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (Part One) One of the most innovative of all superhero films, Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse pioneered its own pop-art visual style, and introduced the film world to the concept of different Spider-Men (Spider-Mans?) in alternate universes – a concept that has since been borrowed by Marvel's live-action Spider-Man: No Way Home. It's unlikely that the sequel will be quite as inventive, but, as the sub-title suggests, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (Part One) is the first episode in a two-part story, which makes it a rarity in the world of animated films. Once again masterminded by creators of The Lego Movie Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, the film unites such Spider-People as Miles Morales (Shameik Moore), Peter B Parker (Jake Johnson), Gwen Stacy (Hailee Steinfeld) and the Spider-Man of the year 2099 (Oscar Isaac). (NB) Released internationally on 7 October The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent Nicolas Cage gets the role of a life, actually, his lifetime, playing a fictional version of Nicolas Cage in this tongue-in-cheek action comedy. Fictional Nic accepts a $1 million payday to make a personal appearance at a fan's birthday party in Spain, a move that somehow comes to involve Tiffany Haddish as a CIA agent. Cage has always been savvy about his image and has a winning sense of humour about his career, which veers between respected performances, as in last year's drama Pig, and... let's just say a lot of over-the-top stuff. The Unbearable Weight promises to make references to plenty of his movies, so there is one safe bet: no film this year will be more meta. (CJ) Released internationally on 22 April The Worst Person in the World If you're lucky, you can get through your 20s with none of the restrictions you had as a child, and none of the responsibilities which come later. But what should you do with all that freedom? It's a question that puzzles Julie (Renate Reinsve) in Joachim Trier's bittersweet romantic comedy drama, The Worst Person in the World. Divided into 12 chapters, this generational character study follows Julie through her early adulthood in Oslo as she tries to decide which job and which man are right for her. According to viewers who have seen it at festivals and preview screenings, The Worst Person in the World is one of the Best Films in the World. It currently has a score of 100% on Rotten Tomatoes, Barack Obama included it on his list of favourite movies of 2021, and the luminous Reinsve won the best actress prize at Cannes. (NB) Released in the US on 4 February 2022 Don't Worry Darling This psychological thriller has been garnering tabloid and internet headlines for months, thanks to the relationship between director Oliva Wilde, and one of its stars, popstar Harry Styles. What's on screen is likely to be much more fascinating, though. The ever-surprising Florence Pugh – of Little Women, Midsommar and Black Widow – transforms herself yet again, into a 1950s housewife in a utopian community who begins to suspect that her world and her husband (Styles) are concealing dark secrets. Wilde, who sharply directed the very different coming-of-age comedy Booksmart, has told Vogue that films like Fatal Attraction and Indecent Proposal were among her inspirations here because they ""are really sexy, in a grown-up way"". That would certainly set her film apart in a world of superheroes. (CJ) Released internationally in on 23 September She Said  Journalists are the heroines here, with Carey Mulligan and Zoe Kazan playing the New York Times investigative reporters who unearthed the news about Harvey Weinstein, the one-time movie mogul now serving time in prison for rape and sexual assault. The woman behind the camera is as impressive as the stars, if less famous: Maria Schrader, recognisable as an actress (Deutschland 83) is also the Emmy-winning director of the Netflix series Unorthodox and the director of the Oscar-shortlisted comedy I'm Your Man. She should bring a sharp-eyed style and astute social awareness to the story that helped launch #MeToo. (CJ) Released in the US on 18 November Babylon Damien Chazelle's love of Hollywood's golden age shone through his Oscar-nominated musical comedy, La La Land. Now the writer-director is sharing that love again in Babylon, a glamorous period drama that takes place in the roaring 20s. Specifically, the film is set at the end of the silent era, much like Singin' In The Rain and The Artist, and it mixes fictional characters with historical figures, much like Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. It also shares two of its stars with Once Upon a Time in Hollywood: Brad Pitt plays a fictional director who has trouble adjusting to the new sound technology, and Margot Robbie plays Clara Bow, the real-life so-called ""It Girl"" who was a colossal box-office draw in both the silents and the talkies. (NB) Released on 25 December Top Gun: Maverick OK, so this belated Top Gun sequel was on our list of films to watch in 2021, and before that it was scheduled to come out in 2020, but we're still optimistic that lovers of supersonic aerobatics will finally get what they've been waiting for this year, shortly before Tom Cruise's 60th birthday. It was back in 1986 that Cruise last played Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell, a trainee fighter pilot in the US Navy. Can anyone really believe that, all these years later, Maverick would only be a captain while his old frenemy ""Iceman"" (Val Kilmer) would be a four-star general? Maybe not, but it should be fun to see Cruise in his Aviator shades and bomber jacket once again, alongside such new recruits to the series as Jennifer Connelly, Jon Hamm, Ed Harris and Miles Teller. Cruise fans take note: Mission: Impossible 7 is due in September, too. (NB) Released internationally on 27 May Avatar 2 There are two things we know about James Cameron: he can't be rushed, and he loves the ocean. Those qualities come together in Avatar 2, the first of a whopping four planned sequels to his 2009 spectacle, the highest-grossing movie of all time. The new film returns to the planet of Pandora, where blue-skinned Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) and her human husband Jake (Sam Worthington) are now parents, and Earthlings still haven't solved the climate crisis. Most of the action takes place underwater and was shot in a 900,000-gallon tank. The Avatar sequels have been in the works for a decade, but Cameron's water-logged hits, Titanic and The Abyss, also arrived behind schedule, and it all turned out just fine. (CJ) Released internationally (so they say) on 16 December Lightyear Buzz Lightyear has been central to four Toy Story feature films, his own TV series, and various animated shorts. This year, the square-jawed Space Ranger is getting a film of his own – sort of. The idea is that the Buzz Lightyear in Toy Story was a plastic action figure, whereas the new animation – a homage to the sci-fi films of the 1970s and 1980s – is the big-budget adventure movie which that action figure was based on. It's a slightly confusing concept, but it lets director Angus MacLane (co-director of Finding Dory) and screenwriter Pete Docter (Soul, Up, Inside Out) bring back a beloved character while giving his interstellar scrapes a new look, a more serious tone, and a fresh voice: Chris Evans rather than Tim Allen is the actor who'll be shouting, ""To infinity – and beyond!"" (NB) Released internationally on 17 June Elvis It's been almost a decade since the release of Baz Luhrmann's The Great Gatsby, but the Australian writer-director of Strictly Ballroom, Romeo + Juliet, and Moulin Rouge! is back at last. Never one to shy away from a big, risky project, Luhrmann has made an Elvis Presley biopic that chronicles 20 years in the life of The King of Rock ’n’ Roll. Austin Butler – an uncanny lookalike – has the title role, alongside Olivia DeJonge as Elvis's wife Priscilla and Tom Hanks as his manager, ""Colonel"" Tom Parker, the Dutch carnival worker who reinvented himself as an all-American impresario. Don't be surprised if Luhrmann indulges his addiction to loud music and splashy spectacle in the Las Vegas scenes – and don't be surprised if Hanks is nominated for an Oscar in 2023. (NB) Released on 24 June Blonde It's Ana de Armas's turn to put on the platinum wig as Marilyn Monroe, whose allure for novelists and filmmakers seems inexhaustible. Blonde is based on Joyce Carol Oates' 2000 novel that takes us inside the mind of Monroe, now known to the world as the neediest, sexiest and most tragically-exploited movie star of the 1950s and '60s. Writer-director Andrew Dominick, who made the underrated Brad Pitt Western The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, follows Oates' lead in coyly nicknaming Marilyn's husbands. Adrien Brody's character, Arthur Miller, is called only The Playwright. Bobby Cannavale, the Joe DiMaggio figure, is The Ex-Athlete. IMDb also lists a character called President's Pimp, so there may be room for surprises even in this often-told story. (CJ) Released in 2022   Black Panther: Wakanda Forever Chadwick Boseman wasn't just the star of Black Panther, he was an inspirational figure who revolutionised Hollywood's representation of African and African-American characters. Shortly after he died of cancer in August 2020, Marvel's boss, Kevin Feige, announced that no one else could play T'Challa, aka Black Panther, and so the character wouldn't be recast for further films. This left Ryan Coogler, the director and co-writer, with a fearsomely difficult task: how to make a satisfying Black Panther sequel without the franchise's lead actor and lead character. All we know for certain is that nearly all of the previous film's cast and crew will return, including Lupita Nyong'o as T'Challa's ex-girlfriend and Letitia Wright as his sister Shuri. In the comics, Shuri took on the mantle of the Black Panther while her brother was in a coma, so could something similar happen in the film? (NB) Released on 11 November   Knives Out 2 Same private detective: Daniel Craig as Benoit Blanc, the sleuth with the cartoonishly over-the-top accent from some indeterminate part of the American South. Different murder mystery: this time set in Greece, with a new cast including Edward Norton, Janelle Monáe and Dave Bautista. Same writer and director: Rian Johnson, but much richer. Netflix made a deal reportedly for $469 million (including production budget) for two sequels to Johnson's 2019 hit that evoked the classic board game Cluedo (or Clue, if you're in North America). Whodunnits come and go, but Craig's Blanc is an original, witty confection of a character, an engaging parody that still allows you to be invested in his crime-fighting.

Hawkish,Nine TV shows to watch this January,2024-09-25,2022-01-05,Amy Charles,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20220104-nine-tv-shows-to-watch-this-january,"From the glitzy The Gilded Age to a James Gunn prequel series to The Suicide Squad and a darkly comic psychological thriller, Amy Charles picks the series not to miss this January. The Gilded Age Creator of Downton Abbey Julian Fellowes has turned his attention to late-19th Century New York for another period drama examining the complex minutiae of high society, and the potential pitfalls it faces as the world changes. The Gilded Age begins with Marian Brook (played by daughter of Meryl Streep, Louisa Jacobson), moving to New York City from Pennsylvania, to live with her aunts (played by Cynthia Nixon and Christine Baranski). This pair are as old money as it comes, and become embroiled in a social war with their neighbours the Russells (Morgan Spector and Carrie Coon), a nouveau riche couple who made money through the railways. The cast is stacked with Broadway stars including Denée Benton, Nathan Lane and Audra McDonald, and from the trailer this show looks to be just as soapy, escapist and glamorous as Downton, but this time with not one, but two wise-cracking old-school matriarchs. The Gilded Age premieres on 24 January on HBO and HBO Max in the US, and on 25 January on Sky Atlantic and Now TV in the UK. Archive 81 Loosely based on the horror podcast of the same name, Archive 81 is a supernatural thriller with convergent timelines. Archivist Dan Turner (Mamoudou Athie, The Circle), who has a tragic past, is restoring damaged videotapes, which feature an investigation into a cult that was filmed in the mid-90s at the behest of a secretive businessman. The filmmaker Melody Pendras (Dina Shihabi, Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan) came to a grisly end 25 years ago, and in the process of working on the tapes, Dan comes to believe he can save her. Matt McGorry (Orange is the New Black) and Martin Donovan (Tenet, Big Little Lies) co-star. Archive 81 is released on 14 January on Netflix. Peacemaker Written and directed by The Suicide Squad director James Gunn, this new HBO series zones in on one of the members of the supervillain crew, played by John Cena, and tells his origin story. As his name suggests, Peacemaker is obsessed with keeping the peace, no matter how many people are hurt in order to achieve it. The trailer suggests that viewers should expect to see a lot more of Gunn's trademark irreverence, as well as the high-octane, violent action sequences seen in The Suicide Squad. However in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Gunn said that while ""there are a lot of similarities to The Suicide Squad … there are also a lot of things that are very different, in that it's quieter in some ways… it's even more grounded, more natural and more real. But it's still within a big science-fiction storyline."" The rest of the cast includes Danielle Brooks (Orange is the New Black), Freddie Stroma (Bridgerton), and Robert Patrick, best remembered as Terminator 2's shape-shifting bad guy, who plays Auggie, Peacemaker's plain-speaking and never-satisfied father. Peacemaker premieres on 13 January on HBO Max in the US. The Afterparty In this new comedy-thriller, a high-school reunion goes very, very wrong when, amongst the frivolity and excess of reuniting with old friends and foes, a murder is committed. The host, almost universally disliked popstar Xavier (Dave Franco) is found dead, and Detective Danner (Tiffany Haddish) is tasked with uncovering who killed him; making it more high-concept is the fact that each episode will show the night from the perspective of a different partygoer while using a different film genre that matches the particular characters' personality. The cast is packed with great comic actors including Sam Richardson, Zoë Chao, Ben Schwartz, Ike Barinholtz, Ilana Glazer and Jamie Demetriou. In a statement when the teaser trailer was released, co-creators Chris Miller and Phil Lord (The Lego Movie, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse) said ""This is one of the most surprising, original and fun projects we've ever made… Our goal was to tell a comedic whodunnit story in a new and exciting way."" Watch the trailer here. The Afterparty premiers on 28 January on Apple TV+. Around the World in 80 Days Warm up the wintry evenings with this joyous adaptation of Jules Verne's classic novel, which travels the globe in magnificent period fashion. Starring David Tennant (Doctor Who) as Phileas Fogg, this family-friendly adventure feels perfect for now. Set in 1872, it begins with the eccentric Fogg making a £20,000 (the equivalent of over a million pounds today) bet that he can circumnavigate the globe in the titular time limit. Tagging along is French valet Passepartout (Ibrahim Koma), and young journalist Abigail 'Fix' Fortescue (Leonie Benesch) who is documenting his progress for a British newspaper. Created by Life on Mars' Ashley Pharoah and with a score co-written by Hans Zimmer, it is ""big television"" that ""zips around the planet"", as the Guardian put it – and with a second series already confirmed, it's certainly worth hopping on and enjoying the ride. Watch the trailer here. Around the World in 80 Days is available on PBS Masterpiece in the US, BBC iPlayer in the UK, France 2 in France and ZDF in Germany. As We See It ""I've spent my entire life trying to hide the autism thing,"" Jack, (Rick Glassman, Undateable), tells his helper Mandy in the trailer for new series As We See It. ""I think you are such a beautiful person that you shouldn't have to hide who you are,"" Mandy (Sosie Bacon, Mare of Easttown) replies. ""That makes me want to throw up,"" retorts Jack. It's an exchange that seems to give some idea about the irreverent approach to neurodiversity of this coming-of-age comedy drama following three twenty-somethings, all of whom are on the autistic spectrum, as they navigate work, friendships and love in the modern world. Centring on Jack, Harrison (Albert Rutecki) and Violet (Sue Ann Pien), each played by actors who identify as living on the autistic spectrum, it's based on the award-winning Israeli series On the Spectrum, and could help to redress the tired tropes used to depict in the autistic community in previous films and TV series. As We See It is released on 21 January on Prime Video. The Journalist As Netflix continues to invest more and more in content from all corners of the globe, this new Japanese series, which tackles globally relevant issues of political corruption, could be the latest non-English language show to hit big on the platform. Based on the award-winning 2019 film of the same name, and created by its writer-director Michihito Fujii, it stars Ryoko Yonekura (Doctor X) as Anna, the titular reporter searching for the truth as she embarks on a major investigation that could implicate people in the highest echelons of power. The Journalist is released on 13 January on Netflix. The Woman in the House Across the Street from the Girl in the Window Over the last few years, the books market became flooded with murder mysteries with unreliable female narrators. Then came the film and TV adaptations of the same novels; you know the ones: The Girl on the Train, Gone Girl, Woman in the Window, the list goes on. Now, The Woman in the House Across the Street from the Girl in the Window puts a darkly parodic spin on this sub-genre, with The Good Place's Kristen Bell taking on the leading role as Anna, who heartbroken and living alone, and with a habit of drinking very, very large glasses of wine, witnesses a murder – or so she thinks. The result is a psychological thriller with laughs: speaking to Entertainment Weekly, Bell said of reading the script for the first time ""It was like nothing I'd ever heard before, and it made me laugh… It was so outside the box and absurd that I knew I had to be involved."" Watch the trailer here. The Woman in the House Across the Street from the Girl in the Window is released on 28 January on Netflix. The Tourist Fifty Shades of Grey star Jamie Dornan is the charismatic lynchpin of this gripping six-parter set in the Australian outback. As it begins, his character, simply known as The Man, is driving across the desert and realises he's being pursued by an enormous truck. After being driven off the road, he then wakes up in hospital, with absolutely no idea who he is. Helen, a police officer played by Danielle Macdonald (Patti Cake$), is determined to help him rediscover his identity, but as The Man and his companions search for the truth, others search for him. Written and executive produced by TV thriller maestros Jack and Harry Williams (The Missing, Baptiste, Liar), it has received acclaim from critics including The Guardian's Lucy Mangan who wrote that ""it's well worth watching this fun, stylish and confident caper, which clearly still has numerous twists up its sleeve and characters to play with."" Watch the trailer here. The Tourist is available on BBC iPlayer in the UK. Love film and TV? Join BBC Culture Film and TV Club on Facebook, a community for cinephiles all over the world.

Hawkish,Nine TV shows to watch in June,2024-09-25,2021-05-31,Eddie Mullan,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20210527-nine-tv-shows-to-watch-in-june,"From Loki to Lupin and the return of Tuca & Bertie, Eddie Mullan picks the programmes worth seeing this month. Loki Following WandaVision and The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, the Marvel Cinematic Universe returns to the small screen once more with a series centred on Loki (Tom Hiddleston), Thor's malevolent brother who now steps out of his sibling's shadow. Set after the time-travelling events of Avengers: Endgame, which saw him steal the all-powerful cube known as the Tesseract from S.H.I.E.L.D. and make a quick exit, it sees Loki come to the attention of the Time Variance Authority. Responsible for protecting the proper flow of time, the TVA's Mobius (Owen Wilson) and Judge Renslayer (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) quickly move to recruit Loki to help repair the issues he has created in the timeline – namely the breaking of reality – but can the god of mischief be trusted? Only time will tell. Sophia Di Martino, Wunmi Mosaku and Richard E Grant also star. Watch the trailer here. Premieres 9 June on Disney+. Lupin The French-language heist comedy-drama series, which became Netflix's first smash-hit show of the year, returns for another helping of escapism entertainment, with part two of its debut series.

Having framed Assane's father over the theft of a diamond necklace, Pelligrini and his henchmen pursue Assane.

Watch the trailer here. Premieres 11 June on Netflix. Time What does it take to survive in a British prison? This three-part BBC drama by Cracker writer Jimmy McGovern stars Sean Bean (Game of Thrones) and Stephen Graham (Line of Duty) as two men living on the edge – on either side of the cell door.

Premieres 6 June on BBC One in the UK. Sweet Tooth Taking place in a post-apocalyptic future, new comic-book adaptation Sweet Tooth inhabits a world where a mysterious event has wreaked havoc on humanity, and led to the strange emergence of babies being born part-human and part-animal.

After a decade of living safely in a forest home, one of the hybrids, a boy with antlers named Gus (Christian Convery), befriends a wandering human loner named Jepperd (Nonso Anozie). Together they set out in search of answers to Gus's origins, journeying across what’s left of the US, while encountering unexpected allies and enemies. Watch the trailer here. Premieres 4 June on Netflix. Intelligence Retinal scans at the ready, as David Schwimmer is back for some more classified misadventures in series two of this Sky comedy, which pairs up two intelligence employees from different sides of the Atlantic, with Schwimmer as a deluded alpha-male National Security agent and Nick Mohammed as his clueless British computer analyst sidekick. After narrowly avoiding extradition from the UK on charges of treason, Jerry Bernstein (Schwimmer) again finds himself the centre of attention when Russians obtain a cyber-attack weapon that Jerry himself helped develop. With his intel vital to the safety of the UK, he is more than willing to be the hero. But with the stakes so high, can he avoid a national disaster? And more importantly, will the work romance of Mohammed's Joseph Harries develop into something more substantial? Watch the trailer here. Premieres 8 June on Sky One in the UK and 17 June on Peacock in the US. Lisey's Story Master of Horror Stephen King has adapted his 2006 novel Lisey's Story – which the author has stated is his favourite of books he has written – into an eight-part Apple TV+ series, directed by Chilean director Pablo Larraín, best known for the Oscar-nominated Jackie. The story centres on Lisey Landon (Julianne Moore), two years after the death of her husband, a famous novelist named Scott (Clive Owen). Lisey is plagued by the attention of unhinged fanatics and academics who want to collect and examine any of Scott's unpublished work, if it exists.

Joan Allen, Jennifer Jason Leigh, and Dane DeHaan star alongside Moore and Owen. Watch the trailer here. Premieres 4 June on Apple TV+. Katla Netflix's first original Icelandic series tells the story of a small town, Vik, living in the shadow of a subglacial volcano, the titular Katla, which has been erupting constantly for a whole year.

It follows the adventures of two 30-year-old bird-women best friends, toucan Tuca (Tiffany Haddish) and songbird Bertie (Ali Wong), who are just trying to live their lives in a vivid and surreal world of anthropomorphic animals and plants.

Hawkish,Twelve films to watch this October,2024-09-25,2021-10-01,Nicholas Barber,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20210930-twelve-films-to-watch-this-october,"Nicholas Barber picks this month's must-see releases, including sci-fi epic Dune, a Velvet Underground documentary and Wes Anderson's latest offering. Antlers In the latest horror-drama to be produced by Guillermo del Toro, a school teacher (Keri Russell) and a sheriff (Jesse Plemons) suspect that a supernatural creature is lurking near their small Oregon town. Not that Antlers is a straightforward monster movie. The story is rooted in Native American tales of the Wendigo, so the director, Scott Cooper (Hostiles), consulted Professor Grace L Dillon, ""the country's foremost authority"" on the subject. She ""really educated me that for Native Americans, First Nations, it's not folklore, it's not a myth,"" Cooper told Indiewire. ""They truly, truly believe in it, because it represents greed and colonialism when we first came to the shores of what is now America, and pillaged all of their resources and forced them [into] cannibalism... out of that rose the Wendigo."" Released on 28 October in Australia and New Zealand, and 29 October in the UK, Ireland, the US and Canada   Mass Special effects and exotic vistas are all very well, but sometimes it can be even more electrifying to see four actors having a quiet conversation in a small room. In Mass, Fran Kranz's writer-directorial debut, Jason Isaacs, Martha Plimpton, Ann Dowd, and Reed Birney play two couples who meet in grim circumstances. Years earlier, the son of one couple murdered the son of the other in a school shooting. Now, on the advice of a therapist, the four grief-racked parents meet in a church to talk over what happened. Kranz's devastating chamber piece ""is a beautifully-judged and tender work that attempts to reckon with the unthinkable,"" says Hannah Strong in Little White Lies. ""It's a study of human pain and anger in painstaking detail, supported by a script which is hauntingly realistic without dipping into mawkish or exploitative territory."" Released on 8 October in the US and 15 October in Canada The Velvet Underground Todd Haynes directed a biopic of Iggy Pop and David Bowie (Velvet Goldmine) which turned the singers into fictional characters, and a biopic of Bob Dylan (I'm Not There) in which six different actors (including Cate Blanchett) played the lead role. Unsurprisingly, then, his affectionate documentary about The Velvet Underground is more idiosyncratic than the average rock-doc. Using a split-screen format throughout, the film explores New York's art scene in the 1960s, uncovering the bruising childhoods and avant-garde influences that were shared by the band's fractious founder members, Lou Reed and John Cale. ""A brilliantly told story, which causes hearts to soar and break in equal measure,"" says Jo-Ann Titmarch at HeyUGuys, ""Haynes' evocation of the band and the time is vivid and loving. If you love music then you'll love this film."" On Apple TV+ from 15 October Last Night in Soho Edgar Wright's sumptuously weird time-travel horror-comedy stars Thomasin McKenzie (Jojo Rabbit) as a fashion student who is stressed by life in noisy, aggressive central London. She is happier when she slips back to the glamour of the swinging '60s, where her identity merges with that of an aspiring singer, Anya Taylor-Joy (The Queen's Gambit). But maybe Soho in the 1960s has a threatening side, too. Jason Solomons in The Wrap says that ""this is by far the director's best film since his Shaun of the Dead debut, using a soundtrack of The Kinks, Walker Brothers, Cilla Black and Dusty Springfield to propel us on a hugely enjoyable, campy and stylish, yet genuinely scary path that also touches on mental health issues, sexual predators and the demons of creativity"". Last Night in Soho also features sterling performances from two '60s icons, Terence Stamp and the late Diana Rigg, in her final role. Released on 22 October in Canada and 29 October in the UK, Ireland and the US Lamb Maria (Noomi Rapace) and Ingvar (Hilmir Snær Guðnason) run a sheep farm together in a remote Icelandic valley. Neither of them has been happy since the loss of their daughter, so when they find another child to adopt, they don't hesitate... never mind that the baby has rather more hooves and wool than you'd expect a baby to have. What's stranger still is that the smitten couple treats the child as if she is perfectly normal, which makes Valdimar Jóhannsson's atmospheric folk horror/ deadpan comedy both explosively funny and spine-tinglingly eerie. ""Jóhannsson's stunningly assured first feature... is a disturbing experience,"" says David Rooney in The Hollywood Reporter, ""but also a highly original take on the anxieties of being a parent, a tale in which nature plus nurture yields a nightmare"". Released on 8 October in the US and 14 October in Australia The French Dispatch Wes Anderson fans rejoice: the writer-director's 10th film is his most Wes Anderson-ish ever. In The French Dispatch, he takes his meticulous style to new extremes, so barely a frame goes by that isn't ornamented with a split screen, a freeze frame, a sans serif caption, a florid voiceover, or a switch between monochrome and garish colour. Beneath all these elaborate quirks is an anthology of three whimsical short stories set in the fictional French town of Ennui-sur-Blasé, and supposedly drawn from the pages of a New Yorker-style magazine in the mid-20th Century. Timothée Chalamet, Benicio del Toro and Léa Seydoux star alongside such Anderson regulars as Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, Tilda Swinton and Jason Schwartzman. ""While it is sometimes hard to keep up with the dizzying level of detail and whirlwind storytelling,"" says Sophie Monks Kaufman in Hyperallergic, ""it is a consummate pleasure to be in the world of The French Dispatch"".  Released on 22 October in the UK, Ireland, the US and Canada The Show Alan Moore is one of the most important figures in cinema today, even though he has never worked on a film before. What he has done is write countless game-changing graphic novels, several of which have been adapted into films (Watchmen, V For Vendetta, From Hell, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen), and several more of which have had a vast influence on 21st-Century superhero blockbusters. Now at last he has scripted a film of his own, directed by Mitch Jenkins. The Show is a detective yarn about a mystery man (Tom Burke) scouring the streets of Northampton for a jewel thief (Darrell D'Silva), but it's also a surreal, magical, nocturnal odyssey. ""An unrepentantly trippy Noir that assaults the senses, cackling all the while,"" says Kristy Puchko at IGN movies. ""The Show offers a supremely intoxicating adventure, ripe with imagination, rank with decadence, and rabid with more, more Moore."" Released on digital download on 18 October The Last Duel The 83-year-old Sir Ridley Scott is busier than ever, with two films due in cinemas this year, House of Gucci and The Last Duel. Mind you, maybe that should be ""four films"", because The Last Duel is three films in one. Set in 14th-Century France, Scott's Medieval epic is based on the true story of France's last legally sanctioned duel. The jousting combatants are Jacques LeGris (Adam Driver) and Jean de Carrouges (Matt Damon), who accuses LeGris of raping his wife (Jodie Comer). The twist is that we see events three times over, from the perspectives of the main characters, and each section is scripted by a separate writer: Damon, Nicole Holofcener (Can You Ever Forgive Me?) and Ben Affleck (who co-stars as a louche count) each take a turn. Rafael Motamayor in Collider says that The Last Duel has ""a nuanced, complex script, phenomenal performances that should be studied in acting class, and some of the best Medieval fight scenes put to the screen"". Released on 15 October in the UK, Ireland, the US and Canada Dune Alejandro Jodorowsky's version may have collapsed in pre-production, and David Lynch's was a flop, but now at last we have a big-screen Dune that may actually do justice to Frank Herbert's science-fiction novel. Directed by Denis Villeneuve (Blade Runner 2049, Arrival), this is a sombre, sweeping epic which runs for 155 minutes and still only covers the first half of the book. The budget is colossal, the crew is top-notch, and the cast is packed with big names, including Timothée Chalamet, Oscar Isaac, Josh Brolin, Zendaya and Dave Bautista. As space operas about psychic-powered young heroes on desert planets go, it may never be as popular as Star Wars, but, says Clarisse Loughrey in the Independent, ""It is a film of such literal and emotional largeness that it overwhelms the senses [and] of such intimidating grandeur that it's hard to believe it even exists in the first place."" Released on 21 October in the UK and Ireland, and 22 October in the US and Canada Titane For only the second time in its history, and for only the first time since 1993, the Palme d'Or at this year's Cannes Film Festival was won by a film directed by a woman. Even if it hadn't received one of cinema's top prizes, though, Julia Ducournau's Titane would be a must-see. ""In the follow-up to her sensational and literally faint-inducing debut, Raw,"" says Sarah Kurchak in The Spool, ""Ducournau has significantly upped the ante and created a film exponentially more brutal, beautiful, borderline unbearable, and absolutely brilliant"". The film is a gory, blackly-comic shocker about a serial killer (Agathe Rousselle) who has sex with a car and then hides from the authorities by disguising herself as the missing son of a steroid-addled fire chief (Vincent Lindon). But even that summary doesn't convey just how feverish Titane is. Released on 1 October in the US, 7 October in Germany and 8 October in Spain and Sweden Bergman Island Fårö is the small island in the Baltic Sea where Ingmar Bergman lived and shot several of his most celebrated films in the 1960s and 1970s. Fans and film-makers flock there, hoping to be as inspired as the great Swedish auteur was: in Mia Hansen-Løve's enigmatic drama, Bergman Island, two of those pilgrims are Chris (Vicky Krieps) and Tony (Tim Roth), a married pair of writer-directors. Tony is there for a retrospective of his violent thrillers. The insecure Chris is stuck on her latest screenplay, but the island gives her an idea that unfolds as a film within a film starring Mia Wasikowska and Anders Danielsen Lie. ""Bergman Island acts like a love letter to Bergman,"" says Alysha Prasad in One Room With A View, ""but stands on its own as a film that focuses on the artists' journey of storytelling itself. And if all of this isn't enough, we get to witness Wasikowska dancing to The Winner Takes It All by Abba."" Released on 1 October in Sweden and 15 October in the US Ron's Gone Wrong The first feature-length cartoon from a new British studio, Locksmith Animation, Ron's Gone Wrong is a family comedy about the differences between social media and physical interaction. Its schoolboy hero, Barney (Jack Dylan Grazer), is given what seems to be the ideal toy, a shiny robot which is programmed to be his friend – assuming it works properly. The snag is that this particular robot, Ron (Zach Galifianakis), barely works at all. ""Children want someone who agrees with them, who wants to play the same games as them… and that's the type of dream the technology world offers you,"" the film's co-writer and co-director, Sarah Smith, told Peter Gray at the AU Review. ""And in our movie, Barney ends up with Ron, who's completely dysfunctional and broken, who doesn't agree with him and doesn't know anything about him, and they have to build this relationship from that point.""

Hawkish,The film that showed a US in chaos,2024-09-25,2020-10-15,Christina Newland,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20201014-how-nashville-captured-the-turbulence-of-1970s-america,"Forty-five years ago, Robert Altman offered a vision of the US centred on the home of country music. It’s a tale of disorder and denial still relevant now, writes Christina Newland. Nashville, Tennessee is a storied city. It’s home to the Grand Ole Opry, the major ‘you’ve made it, kid’ live venue for country stars, and is widely thought of as the major incubator of country music in the United States. It was 45 years ago when Robert Altman and screenwriter Joan Tewkesbury cast their eye on the city as a backdrop to their 1975 film of the same name. Within an expansive near three-hour running time, they combined a realistic – if heightened – vision of the country music capital with their thoughts on a turbulent political era in the US, sewing their impressions of the star-spangled, hairsprayed, patriotic heartland into a ragged tapestry, and one that was beginning to fray at its edges.  More like this: –      Is Blinding Light the ‘Great American Painting?’ –      The song that unites a divided US –      How The Age of Innocence defined its era Nashville takes place over the course of three days, as a populist third-party presidential candidate – Hal Phillip Walker – hires musicians to perform at one of his political fundraisers. With a meaningless platform including ideas like changing the national anthem to be simpler, Walker’s campaign doesn’t occupy one side or another so much as it is a glorious sham. We never actually see Walker himself, but instead his employees and fixers; his campaign seems entirely represented by a van with a logo and a loudspeaker, driving around the city blaring out slogans and facile talking points.    Altman’s film zones in on some two dozen characters over its duration, each occupying a different stratum of the country music scene in the city. At the top of the pile is Barbara Jean (Ronee Blakley), a gentle star suffering from chronic illness, dressed often in flowing whites like a Victorian doll. Haven Hamilton (Henry Gibson) is the patrician veteran of the scene, a platinum recording artist with a host of obnoxiously sentimental tunes about the US (“We must be doin’ somethin’ right / To last 200 years”). Then there’s Keith Carradine as Tom Frank, part of a popular folk trio on the more bohemian side of things. He’s a callous womaniser, and although his group is ostensibly a part of the counterculture, they ultimately prove to be as shallow as the rest. Meanwhile, Albuquerque (Barbara Harris) and memorably bad singer Sueleen (Gwen Welles) are desperately chasing stardom, even while clearly being ill-equipped for it. In telling his story of the US, Altman both deploys and subverts one of the country’s foundational cultural clichés – the unknown hopping on a bus and finding riches and fame, the countrified Horatio Alger story. A mosaic of music and politics Beginning with a series of fender-benders on the highway outside the city, it develops into a mosaic of stories that capture the surreal and swinging circus of contemporary American life. Amid the good ol’ boys and the connivers, Altman offered an unflinching vision of a nation that had just come through the throes of the Watergate scandal, in which a president who had won by a landslide in the last election was revealed as a crook.   In Nashville’s world, the rules of the game, whether in music or politics, are the same: we see the cheerful ignorance of a group of people who are largely exposed as shallow and morally small, their jockeying for position and power, and use of mawkish sentiment and careworn family values to sell things to a willing public. It’s funny to see how pointed Nashville’s linking of celebrity culture to politicking would become; in less than a decade, movie star cowboy Ronald Reagan would be president. Just like the country’s favourite crooners, presidential hopefuls from both sides of the aisle would call on good old fashioned values of God, country, and looking out for the little folk for years to come, from the fuss made by Jimmy Carter over his former days as a peanut farmer to George W Bush’s down-home Texan routine.  But although many of Altman’s characters are the targets of jaggedly funny satire – not least the insufferable British BBC Radio journalist played by Geraldine Chaplin – there is generosity there, too. From a distant medium shot, he shows the otherwise obnoxious Delbert Reese (Ned Beatty), a lawyer who is one of Walker’s local campaigners, in a quiet moment as he fries eggs, suspecting his wife is having an affair; the cheating woman, played by Lily Tomlin, is a sad and kind housewife with two deaf sons that she dotes on. The Nashville community may not have loved Altman’s pointed depiction of them, but he was never a filmmaker who denied the inexorable, basic humanity of his characters.    At the same time, Altman makes the detail-specific, the incidental, and the intimate seem profound. Nashville transcends its environment even as it captures it so closely; it tells a story about the bitter end road of aspiration, the uselessness of celebrity, and the flagrant stupidity of a political system that increasingly resembles that same celebrity culture. An indelible ending That there is also shown to be underlying violence in that system is unsurprising – at Nashville’s climax, a gunman opens fire at the Walker fundraising concert, shooting an innocent Barbara Jean down on the stage in front of an audience. Cinema and political assassinations became curiously intertwined in the 1970s and early 1980s, from movies that inspired assassination attempts (Taxi Driver) to assassinations that inspired movies (The Parallax View). In the indelible conclusion of the film, Barbara Harris provides a haunting, soulful rendition of a song, It Don’t Worry Me, to soothe the chaotic audience after Barbara Jean is rushed to hospital and the gunman is apprehended. They soon join along with her anthem, a pliant croon of reassurance and repetition that seems to comfort the shell-shocked observers. Cinematographer Paul Lohmann’s camera jumps between individuals, mostly corn-fed white faces – a real-life audience serving as extras, so the apocryphal story goes.   With the deep sentimentality of its songs and the lacquered hair of its gussied-up stars, Nashville was perfectly reflective of its time and place. In the mid-1970s, there was a well-established resurgence of country music in the US. The genre spoke to tradition and old-school Americana; it was the white heartland’s way of pretending that social turbulence, anti-war protests, and presidential corruption were far from their own reality. With very few exceptions – Kris Kristofferson chief among them – the country artists of the era proffered a myopic view of their nation aimed at Nixon’s so-called ‘silent majority’ – the term the President coined in 1969 to refer to those Americans who were poles apart from the new counterculture.  The easy-going verses of It Don’t Worry Me are a catchy ode to cheerful ignorance, after all: “You may say that I ain’t free / But it don’t worry me”. Look at the Southern rock group Lynyrd Skynyrd’s similar admission of indifference a year before – “Watergate, it don’t bother me” they sang in their 1974 anthem Sweet Home Alabama. Altman and Tewksbury do well to remind us that embracing a complicated political reality is not of interest here – a collective denial, some would argue, that continues in the US to this day.  Altman’s peculiar cinematic juggernaut is a grand, empty, ugly emblem of national pride – of politics as entertainment, and of the business of complacency and distraction. Nashville strikes right down to the heart of American life, to its pomposity, and, abidingly, its dubious, paper-over-the-cracks optimism in the face of genuine violence and terror. During a global pandemic and a fraught election season, its despair feels as sharp as ever.    Love film and TV?

Hawkish,The most disastrous musical of all time,2024-09-25,2020-11-26,Nicholas Barber,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20201125-how-a-spider-man-musical-became-a-theatrical-disaster,"Ten years ago, the show Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark had an ill-fated first preview on Broadway – the beginning of its journey to becoming a legendary debacle, writes Nicholas Barber. It’s been 10 years since one of the most momentous nights of Glen Berger’s life. He was already an established off-Broadway playwright and children’s television writer, but on 28 November 2010, a musical he had scripted had its first preview at the Foxwoods Theatre in New York – and it was shaping up to be an international smash. More like this:  – The play that predicted the Trump era  – Why we no longer need superheroes  – Defending cinema’s biggest flop The musical was Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark. Its friendly neighbourhood title character had been a beloved pop-cultural icon for five decades, and had just featured in three Hollywood blockbusters. The songs were written by rock’n’roll royalty, U2’s Bono and The Edge. And the director was Julie Taymor, who had masterminded the record-breaking stage adaptation of Disney’s The Lion King. Turn Off the Dark couldn’t go far wrong with a pedigree like that. Could it? Which is not to say that Berger wasn’t nervous. Speaking to BBC Culture from his home in upstate New York, he remembers how strange it felt to be unveiling something he and his collaborators had been devising together for years. “We were opening the door,” he says, “either to Willy Wonka’s chocolate factory or some sort of slaughterhouse.” The show relied on complicated aerial stunts in which the performers were suspended from wires, and so the first preview was bound to keep stopping and starting as technical hitches were addressed. But everything was going relatively smoothly until the last seconds before the interval. “Then there was a flourish,” says Berger, “when Spider-Man flies off through the audience towards the balcony. And for some reason he stopped, so you had Spider-Man dangling seven feet above the first two rows. It was the worst possible position because no one could reach him. One of the crew members fetched a stick to prod him with, but that didn’t help. It was like a live Spider-Man piñata. But we knew by the end of the night, well, that’s the worst it’s ever going to be. We’ll keep improving it and improving it, and it’s going to be duck soup by the time we open in January.” It didn’t work out like that. Before the first preview, Turn Off the Dark was already being gossiped about as a ‘troubled’ enterprise. Its initial lead producer and guiding light, Tony Adams, had had a fatal stroke in 2005 while in a meeting with The Edge. And the financial crisis of 2007 and 2008 had scared off private investors, so that in August 2009, the production found itself $20 million short of cash. But the bad luck didn’t end there. In the months that followed the first preview, the official opening was repeatedly postponed while Berger and his colleagues dealt with bruising, embargo-defying reviews, sackings, injuries, and countless technical snags. By May 2011, Turn Off the Dark had become so synonymous with theatrical disaster that a headline in The Onion, the satirical newspaper, appeared to be only slightly exaggerating: “Nuclear Bomb Detonates During Rehearsal for ‘Spider-Man’ Musical”. The show did finally have its opening night in June 2011, but by then its fate had effectively been sealed: and though its run continued for another two-and-a-half years, when it closed in January 2014 it had made a loss of $60 million – a Broadway record. A sure-fire hit had become a legendary debacle. “I’m philosophical about all of it,” says Berger. “It might end up in my obituary, and I’m not too happy about that. But I’d rather have Spider-Man on my resumé than the Iraq War.” A written post-mortem Berger went on to write a candid memoir, Song of Spider-Man, which grips like a murder mystery novel: as you read it, you scan the pages for clues that might account for the bloodbath. There are several right at the start of the story. The musical was announced in the summer of 2002 to capitalise on the success of Sam Raimi’s first Spider-Man film. Bono and The Edge signed up soon afterwards, but when the producers approached Taymor, she replied that she would take the job only if she “could find a narrative something to spark her imagination”. That something was the Greek myth of Arachne, a woman who beat Athena in a weaving contest, and was transformed into a spider by the jealous goddess. Avi Arad, Marvel’s chief creative officer, objected: Arachne had nothing to do with Spider-Man, and her inclusion as a major character would be “entirely wrong”. Taymor stood her ground. So what if her concepts were gloomier, more sexualised, and, yes, more pretentious than Stan Lee and Steve Ditko’s comics or Raimi’s films? Her greatest triumphs came from her refusal to compromise. “If Arachne’s out,” she said, “then I’m out.” Another passage in Song of Spider-Man that might get your spider-sense tingling comes a few pages later. Bono and The Edge were so unfamiliar with Broadway musicals, apparently, that a producer had to burn them an educational four-CD compilation of “60 songs from the last sixty years of musical theatre”.  The stadium rockers would “eventually dismiss nearly all the songs as mawkish, dopey, or just ‘pants’”– which could be why the songs they wrote for Turn Off the Dark sounded less like catchy show tunes than vaguely angst-ridden, minor-key U2 B-sides. Berger, who was brought in to co-write the book with Taymor in 2005, is quick to defend his comrades: “Every artist has to figure out what they’re responding to and take it from there.” But still... if you’re staging a Spider-Man musical, it’s probably not ideal to have a director who isn’t keen on Spider-Man comics and two composers who aren’t keen on musicals. And then there was the technology that led to the piñata situation, and which drew the team’s attention away from what Berger describes as “some massive holes in the script”. The comics’ signature sequences of web-spinning and wall-crawling were recreated using computer-controlled cables and winches, but developing the machinery was a long, laborious process, and the results were only marginally less dangerous than an arm-wrestling bout with Doctor Octopus. While swinging from wires in rehearsals, one performer broke his toe and another broke both his wrists. During the first preview, a carabiner was hurriedly unclipped from a cable and dropped on the head of Natalie Mendoza, the actress playing Arachne, leaving her concussed. Saturday Night Live responded on 12 February 2011 with a sketch about a law firm that specialised in Spider-Man-related workplace injuries. The front cover cartoon of The New Yorker on 17 January 2011 depicted a hospital ward full of battered and bandaged Spider-Men. This wasn’t the kind of publicity the producers had been hoping for. As if the broken bones weren’t demoralising enough, the technology was eye-wateringly expensive. One million-dollar gadget was built to lower a web over the audience for the grand finale, only to be scrapped when the effect didn’t come off. Meanwhile, the largest theatre on Broadway was being refurbished to fit in all of the notoriously unreliable hardware. When the show was eventually up and running, operating costs would be $1.1 million a week. Just to break even, it would have had to sell out every performance for four years. And, on the basis of the reviews, that never seemed likely. The critical drubbing Although the producers kept delaying the press night, as they battled to make the plot clearer and the stunts safer, impatient critics simply bought their tickets and sharpened their knives. Hadley Freeman in the Guardian called the show “baffling in its ineptitude”. The aerobatics were “no more spectacular than any cut-price circus”, and the music was “deadening in its mediocrity, tuneless and forgettable”. Ben Brantley in the New York Times agreed that the songs “blur into a sustained electronic twang of varying volume... like a persistent headache”. Charles McNulty in the Los Angeles Times condemned Berger and Taylor’s book as “an absolute farrago”. His summary: “Incoherence isn’t much fun to sit through”. When these reviews were printed in February 2011, Berger was feeling a bit like a live Spider-Man piñata himself. His once close-knit band of collaborators was fragmenting into those who still believed in Taymor’s mystical take on the material, and those who suspected that she was suffering from the “artistic form of megalomania” mentioned in McNulty’s review. “As a writer I was fascinated by watching this little group disintegrate from lack of trust and lack of conviction,” says Berger. “What the reviews did was turn up the dial on the heat lamps. More and more I had this image of an experiment on what stress does to rats in a cage.”   In March 2011, Taymor was replaced by the more pragmatic director Philip William McKinley. A new choreographer was hired, and Berger himself had to share his credit with another writer, Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa. When the revamped version finally opened, seven months after the first preview, its mood had been lightened, its structure had been streamlined, and Arachne’s role had been reduced. Turn Off the Dark had turned off its darkness. The reviews were kinder, and the show ran until January 2014. But it never recouped its money, or repaired its reputation. At the very moment that Marvel’s superhero films were conquering global cinema, the first Marvel superhero musical was crashing down to earth. The myth of Arachne, a proud artist who was laid low by hubris, was all too apt. The show’s fraught behind-the-scenes story came to seem like an archetypal narrative to Berger, too. “It was only after the dust had settled that I realised that the arc of it really fit with the themes that I had been writing about in my fiction for years. It really fascinates me when grandiose ideas fall short. I find that really endearing: to have this vision and then to do battle against reality, to try to bring this intangible thing into the tangible world. It’s just such a lovely thing that makes humans human. To put it in the most pollyannaish way, it was truly a gift to have gone through every moment of it. When you’re a young writer, you think, oh, I should be working on an oil rig, I should be getting real-life experiences so I can write about them later. Well, this was such a hefty experience that I can draw on it for years to come.” If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.

Hawkish,Ten films to watch this August,2024-09-25,2019-07-26,Nicholas Barber,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20190726-ten-films-to-watch-this-august,"Including The Kitchen, The Peanut Butter Falcon and Blinded by The Light, Nicholas Barber picks the films not to miss this month. Blinded by the Light Queen, Elton John and The Beatles have all been given hefty sales boosts lately by crowd-pleasing jukebox films. Now it’s the turn of Bruce Springsteen. Loosely based on a memoir by journalist Sarfraz Manzoor, Blinded by the Light is a comedy-drama about Javed (newcomer Viveik Kalra), a Pakistani-English teenager in the 1980s who dreams of being a writer, but who is discouraged both by his strict family’s objections and by the Luton locals’ racism. Then he hears the tough but tender rock anthems of the Boss. Entertainment Weekly has sung the film’s praises, saying that Gurinda Chadha (Bend It Like Beckham) has made “a Technicolor ode to the power of music so deeply tender and heartfelt that it disarms even the most misanthropic critic’s instincts”. Released 9 August in the UK and Ireland, 14 August in the US and India and 22 August in Germany The Kitchen A year on from the release of Steve McQueen’s Widows, here comes a film with a similar concept: three women with no criminal experience take over their husbands’ crooked activities. But the stellar cast and distinctive period setting should ensure that The Kitchen cooks up an identity of its own. Melissa McCarthy, Tiffany Haddish and Elisabeth Moss star as a trio of Farrah Fawcett-haired gangsters’ wives in 1970s New York. While their husbands are behind bars, the women muscle in on the family business, and soon discover that they are better racketeers than the men ever were. Adapted from the DC Comics series by Ollie Masters and Ming Doyle, the film’s feminist credentials are bolstered by its writer-director, Andrea Berloff, who was Oscar-nominated for her Straight Outta Compton screenplay. Released on 9 August in the US, 21 August in France and 29 August in Australia Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw With all due respect to Vin Diesel, the best thing about the last Fast & Furious film was the bickering banter between Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham’s rival secret agents, Luke Hobbs and Deckard Shaw. Now the follicularly-challenged frenemies have their own spin-off, in which they team up against Brixton Lore (Idris Elba), a villain who may sound like a self-published book of south London anecdotes, but who is actually a ‘cyber-genetically enhanced international terrorist’. Adding to the fun, Helen Mirren cameos as Shaw’s cockney mum Queenie, Vanessa Kirby is his sister, and the whole thing is directed by David Leitch, whose CV – John Wick, Atomic Blonde, Deadpool 2 – suggests that no one is better at making ridiculously over-the-top action extravaganzas. On general release from 1 August Dora and the Lost City of Gold Now that Indiana Jones is as ancient as the relics he unearths, and it’s game over for the Lara Croft franchise, the time is right for a younger tomb raider, namely Dora the Explorer. In the first live-action film to be adapted from the long-running Nickelodeon cartoon, Dora (Isabela Moner) enrols in an American high school. But when her parents (Michael Peña and Eva Longoria) go missing, she returns to the jungle with her backpack, her knife and Boots the monkey (voiced by Danny Trejo). One of the few Hollywood children’s films to have a Latina heroine, Dora and the Lost City of Gold is directed by James Bobin, who made the two recent Muppets films and co-created the Flight of the Conchords TV show, so it could be comedy gold. Released on 1 August in Brazil and Hong Kong and 9 August in the US Pain and Glory Does the gay, grey-bearded, disco-shirted, Madrid-based writer-director in Pedro Almodóvar’s latest film remind you of anyone? Yes, Pain and Glory is Almodóvar’s most autobiographical offering, a gentle comedy drama in which an ageing auteur (Antonio Banderas) ruminates on his career, reconnects with old colleagues and lovers, and reminisces about his mother, who is played in flashbacks by, of course, Penélope Cruz. It’s a charmingly modest collection of murmured conversations and nostalgic reflections. The film premiered at Cannes, where Banderas won the best actor award for his “warm and nuanced” performance. Released on 23 August in the UK, Ireland, and Poland Luce Luce Edgar is a US high school’s star pupil. Played by Kelvin Harrison Jr, he’s an inspirational all-rounder whose academic and athletic achievements are all the more impressive given that he was a child soldier in Eritrea before he was adopted by his liberal American parents (Naomi Watts and Tim Roth). But maybe he isn’t so perfect. One teacher (Octavia Spencer) argues that he harbours violent tendencies and Luce’s parents have to question whether they have made his life better or worse. Directed by Julius Onah and adapted from JC Lee’s stage play, this tense, intelligent and provocative film is, according to The Guardian, “a drama that moves like a thriller with a stark, uncomfortable score and a series of seat-edge confrontations heating up a difficult debate over trust, expectation and racial stereotypes”. Released on 2 August in the US and 9 August in Canada Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark A spookier teen horror than the recent Goosebumps films, Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark is inspired by the trilogy of nightmare-inducing children’s books written by Alvin Schwartz in the 1980s. Set in 1968, it tells the creepy tale of some small-town teenagers who find a book in an abandoned mansion... a book in which all the horror stories are about them. The director is André Øvredal, who made the terrific Norwegian found-footage horror comedy, Trollhunter. But the most exciting name on the credits is the film’s co-writer and co-producer, Guillermo del Toro: this is his first big-screen project since his Oscar-winning creature feature, The Shape of Water. If nothing else, The Toe Monster, Jangly Man, The Pale Lady and Harold the Scarecrow should provide some excellent Halloween costume ideas. Released on 8 August in Denmark and the Netherlands, 9 August in the US and Spain and 23 August in the UK The Peanut Butter Falcon No, The Peanut Butter Falcon isn’t a film about sandwich spreads or birds of prey. The title is the name that a 22-year-old wrestling fan (Zack Gottsagen) plans to use when he becomes a professional wrestler himself. The tricky part is that he has Down’s syndrome, and is kept under supervision in a Virginia nursing home. When he decides to learn the ropes in a Florida wrestling school run by his idol (Thomas Haden Church), he has to escape and set off through the swampy South, helped by a fugitive fisherman (Shia LeBeouf), and pursued by a nursing home attendant (Dakota Johnson). A Mark Twain-like backwoods odyssey, this warm-hearted buddy movie from Mike Schwartz and Tyler Nilson is “deeply moving”, says The Playlist. “By keeping the humour rooted in the performances and only letting sentimentality creep in when necessary, Nelson and Schwartz have crafted a film that feels refreshing, unique, and emotional.” Released on 9 Aug in the US and 29 Aug in Portugal Where’d You Go, Bernadette Richard Linklater has a vastly varied filmography, ranging from children’s comedies (School of Rock, Bad News Bears) to psychedelic sci-fi cartoons (A Scanner Darkly), and from romantic trilogies (Before Sunrise and its sequels) to true-crime docudramas (Bernie). But his twentieth film still seems like a departure, partly because it’s his first to focus on a female character, and partly because it ranges all the way from the US to the Antarctic. Based on Maria Semple’s bestselling 2012 novel, Where’d You Go, Bernadette stars a dark-bobbed Cate Blanchett as Bernadette Fox, a sardonic suburban mother who shocks her family when she rediscovers her passion for architecture – and then disappears. Kristen Wiig, Judy Greer and Billy Crudup co-star in a mid-life crisis comedy with a mysterious twist. Released 16 August in the US and Poland and 29 August in the Netherlands and Portugal What You Gonna Do When The World’s On Fire? In the summer of 2017, a poverty-racked Louisiana community was shaken by a string of racist killings. Italian writer-director Roberto Minervini was there to film the meetings and marches that followed. His urgent documentary, beautifully shot in stark monochrome, shows its cast of bar owners and blues singers being attacked by the Ku Klux Klan, ignored by the authorities, and shunted from the neighbourhood by gentrifying landlords. But there is some hope to be found in their love and solidarity. There is also so much energy and memorable dialogue in What You Gonna Do When The World’s On Fire? that you could easily mistake it for a fictional drama. One Room With A View calls the film “heart-breaking, essential and inspiring”. And it feels even more important now than it did two years ago. Released 16 Aug in the US Love film?

Hawkish,Is The Post another Spielberg triumph?,2024-09-25,2017-12-19,Caryn James,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20171218-film-review-is-the-post-another-spielberg-triumph,"Meryl Streep and Tom  Hanks star in a new film about the 1971 Pentagon Papers scandal. It's the director's ""most Capra-esque movie ever"" writes Caryn James. A stirring defence of freedom of the press, The Post arrives at a time when the words 'fake news' echo through almost every political conversation. Director Steven Spielberg rushed the project into production because its story, set in 1971 when President Richard Nixon ruled like a crime boss, speaks so potently to the world today. Washington Post editor Ben Bradlee and publisher Katharine Graham (Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep) defy the Nixon administration and publish the classified Pentagon Papers, revealing the government’s lies about the war in Vietnam. The Post is also Spielberg’s most Capra-esque movie ever, with all the positive and negative qualities that suggests. Spielberg, like Frank Capra, is a master of pop entertainment. Here he delivers a fast-paced story laced with moments to cheer for, full of undeniable heroes. But the movie is also earnest and corny, annoying in the way it  spoon-feeds the audience its blatant message and tries to stage-manage our emotional responses. - Is The Last Jedi the best of Star Wars? - Margot Robbie deserves a gold for I, Tonya - The Disaster Artist is an uproarious farce Hanks and Streep bring their movie-star charisma and best character work to the roles. They lift the film above a screenplay that is pedestrian but clear, and which begins by giving us historical context. In 1966, Daniel Ellsberg (Matthew Rhys), who would ultimately leak the papers from the think tank where he works, observes Defense Secretary Robert McNamara (Bruce Greenwood) privately rage at the fact that the United States is stalled in Vietnam. Minutes later McNamara assures the press, “In every respect, we’re making progress.” Today it’s assumed that politicians lie and obfuscate. The Post takes us back to a day when that occurrence seemed like news. Cut to a few years later in 1971 and Bradlee is trying to elevate The Washington Post from its lowly status as a local paper. No one could have known that Woodward and Bernstein would break open the Watergate scandal for the Post just a few years later. Without overplaying, Hanks’ Bradlee struts, growls and is always the smartest, biggest personality in the room. Hanks conveys the glee Bradlee feels at getting a scoop, his integrity (he will not let Nixon hand-pick a reporter to cover his daughter’s White House wedding), and above all the birddog instinct of a true newsman. Graham, whose finishing school accent suits her helmet hair and ladylike wardrobe, had become the unlikely and uneasy publisher of the family-run paper after her husband’s suicide. With her typical wizardry, Streep captures both Graham’s determination and the deep insecurity she must overcome with every new challenge (chronicled beautifully in her Pulitzer Prize-winning autobiography, Personal History). After the New York Times begins publishing the Papers, the government gets an injunction preventing it from releasing more. Bradlee sees a chance to jump into the story despite the danger: he and Graham might be charged with treason for printing classified information. Spielberg wonderfully recreates the dynamic of a newsroom: the buzz of energy, the abrupt conversations, the shared sense of pride when something goes right. And he surrounds his stars with a vibrant cast. Among the best: Carrie Coon as editorial writer Meg Greenfield and Bob Odenkirk as assistant managing editor Ben Bagdikian, a weary-looking veteran journalist who makes a crucial connection with Ellsberg. And the film creates tension in low-stakes settings. Sprawled out on Bradlee’s living room floor, a team of reporters pieces together the undated pages of the secret papers Bagdikian has delivered, racing against a deadline, wondering if Graham will defy her own lawyers and give the go-ahead to publish. But the film wastes its most intriguing opportunities. Bradlee belatedly realises, and confides to Graham, that his prized friendship with President John F Kennedy was not on equal terms after all, that the editor might have been used. But The Post zooms past that thorny, fascinating issue so Hanks can deliver one of the film’s blunt lessons about politicians: “The way they lied. Those days have to be over.” Streep’s performance saves the film from its own heavy-handedness. The first version of the script was by Liz Hannah, who was inspired by Graham’s trajectory as a woman coming into her own. Spielberg brought on Josh Singer, the screenwriter of Spotlight. However the writers worked together, the seams between the feminist story and the journalism story are conspicuous. Almost all the scenes about progress for women are ham-fisted in construction and feel shoehorned in. In the midst of the Pentagon Papers crisis, Graham speaks to her grown daughter (Alison Brie), who is putting her own young daughter to bed. In that maternal episode, Graham admits that she never thought she’d even have a job, much less run the company. “I thought that was the way it was supposed to be. Everybody thought that way then.” Still uncertain of herself, she tearfully says she does not want it to be her fault if the paper goes under. Streep is magnificently nuanced; there is no need for John Williams’ mawkish music to intrude and tell us that this is meant to be a touching moment.   And when Graham walks out of the Supreme Court after a hearing about whether the Post can publish the Papers, she descends the steps and rows of women – only women – conveniently step aside as if she has just parted the Red Sea.  The Post lives in the long shadow of All the President’s Men, a far better film that turned Woodward and Bernstein’s reporting into a sophisticated thriller. Spielberg has created a well-crafted message movie, which raises a question haunting all message movies: who, exactly, is the audience, apart from the like-minded viewers it is preaching to? Graham gets her big empowered moment when she tells a sexist board member, “This is no longer my father’s company, it’s no longer my husband’s company, it is my company.” But the most Capra-esque episode – think of Jimmy Stewart on the Senate floor in Mr Smith Goes to Washington – goes to Coon. In the crowded newsroom, Greenfield takes a phone call and relays the Supreme Court ruling allowing publication of the Papers. “The Founding Fathers gave the free press the protection it must have to fulfill its essential role in our democracy,” she says. It is a scene effectively calculated to cause viewers to cheer, and perhaps get a little weepy as they realize how precarious that freedom seems today.   Even as The Post warns about the threats to journalism, though, it offers hope. When the president rails against the press, he is seen from a distance, a shadowy figure in the White House. But the voice Spielberg uses is authentically Nixon’s own, from his once-secret tapes. Nixon did everything he could to silence the press. We know how that turned out. ★★★☆☆  If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.

Hawkish,Republicans step up Trump attacks in second debate,2024-09-25,2023-09-28,By Sam Cabral,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66943323,"Seven Republican candidates tangled over the economy, immigration and China at the second 2024 presidential debate. Frontrunner Donald Trump - who skipped the event to woo voters more than 2,000 miles (3,200km) away in Michigan - was branded ""missing in action"" by his nearest rival Ron DeSantis. The contenders on stage also attacked each other during the increasingly heated two-hour forum on Wednesday. But as the night ended, none had seized momentum with a standout moment. The eventual Republican nominee will face President Joe Biden, the likely Democratic candidate, next year. On stage for the Fox Business Network's primetime showdown were Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley, former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, former Vice-President Mike Pence, South Carolina Senator Tim Scott, and North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum. Polite exchanges marked the first half hour of the debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California - but it grew ill-mannered as the night wore on, with the three moderators losing control several times. Mr Trump leads the Republican field by about 40 points in most opinion polls and had long indicated he would skip the debates. Unlike in the first debate, Mr DeSantis - who is polling in a very distant second place - directly criticised the former president in his most aggressive effort so far to lure away Mr Trump's loyal supporters. Twice calling out his fellow Floridian for being ""missing in action"", he touted a record of enacting conservative priorities as the state's governor, including an abortion ban. He added that Americans needed a president who could serve two terms, a reference to the fact Mr Trump cannot do so as a former occupant of the White House. But Mr DeSantis declined the final question of the night about which candidates should leave the race, declaring it ""disrespectful"". Mr Christie, an ally turned arch critic of the former president, did not feel the same. He labelled Mr Trump ""Donald Duck"", alleging he was too afraid to defend his record and had ducked the debates. ""This guy has not only divided our party, he's divided families and friends all over this country,"" he said of Mr Trump. ""He needs to be voted off the island and he needs to be taken out of this process."" Immigration, and the influx of migrants and drugs across the US southern border, have been top concerns among Republican voters and came up periodically through the two-hour event. Mr DeSantis vowed to treat Mexican drug cartels ""as the foreign terrorists that they are"", while Ms Haley said she ""will send in our special operations and we will take out the cartels"". Such arguments, also heard at the first debate, have drawn strong criticism in Mexico, where many remain distrustful of US interventionism in domestic security affairs. The future of US-China relations, and the perceived threat posed by the Asian superpower, also came under scrutiny by a largely hawkish field of candidates. Mr DeSantis said ""elites"" in Washington had chosen to ""surrender"" to the Chinese Communist Party, while Mr Burgum attacked the Biden administration for a ""policy of appeasement"". Mr Pence argued that President Biden's climate policies were only ""good for Beijing"" and Ms Haley lamented the flow of the deadly drug fentanyl from China to the US over the border with Mexico. Several candidates piled on against Mr Ramaswamy, a biotech entrepreneur and political newcomer who has seen a polling bounce since the first debate. The 38-year-old faced particularly harsh criticism from Ms Haley, who said: ""Honestly every time I hear you, I feel a little bit dumber for what you say."" But Mr Ramaswamy held firm with highly unorthodox policy proposals, including forcefully asserting that being transgender was ""a mental health disorder"" and that children under the age of 16 should be barred from using ""addictive"" social media. Another ex-businessman on the stage, the low-polling Mr Burgum, interrupted the forum on several occasions to argue it was time to ""treat the taxpayer like a customer"". Mr Burgum also argued that he was the kind of ""business leader"" Republicans have been looking for and that, as North Dakota's chief executive, he had already done what his rivals had only proposed. An hour earlier, Mr Trump had made a speech at an auto supplier in the Detroit suburbs, in which he barely mentioned his opponents. After the debate, his campaign's senior advisor sent out a statement calling for the debate organisers to ""immediately put an end to any further primary debates so we can train our fire on Crooked Joe Biden and quit wasting time and money that could be going to evicting Biden from the White House"". Mr Trump's remarks in Detroit came one day after Mr Biden, in a first for a sitting president, joined a picket line with auto industry workers at the United Auto Workers (UAW) labour union's invitation. Speaking at a non-unionised factory, the ex-president slammed his successor's push for electric vehicle production and warned workers they were ""all going to be out of business"". And he repeatedly called on UAW leaders to endorse his presidential bid, telling workers to ""get your union leaders to endorse me, and I'll take care of the rest"".  It was an early skirmish in the battle for the blue-collar vote, and their most direct face-off so far, ahead of next year's election. A CBS News poll conducted earlier this month found Mr Trump beating Mr Biden by one point in a rematch of their 2020 head-to-head. Republican voters will begin choosing their candidate in state-by-state contests in January, with the first taking place in Iowa. The winner will be formally crowned at the party convention in Milwaukee in July and go on to the general election less than four months later."
Hawkish,'Awful' O'Sullivan through to Masters semi-finals,2024-09-25,2024-01-11,Neil Goulding,https://www.bbc.com/sport/snooker/67948489,"Ronnie O'Sullivan is chasing his first Masters crown since 2017 Mr Q Masters Venue: Alexandra Palace, London Dates: 7-14 January Coverage: Watch live on BBC TV, BBC iPlayer, BBC Red Button and online; live text coverage of the final on Sunday 14 January. Ronnie O'Sullivan labelled himself ""awful"" despite beating Barry Hawkins 6-3 to stay on course for a record-extending eighth Masters title. O'Sullivan rallied from 3-2 down to secure a place in his 15th Masters semi-final at Alexandra Palace. Hawkins started brightly, but O'Sullivan finished stronger and will play Shaun Murphy on Saturday (13.00 GMT) after he beat Jack Lisowski 6-3. ""I'm lucky to get through,"" O'Sullivan told BBC Sport.  Masters match schedule, BBC TV coverage and tournament history ""I felt bad for Barry - I just dragged him down to my level. It's a funny old game. ""I didn't feel any pressure at all to be honest. Maybe that's why I played like I did. I think you need that pressure sometimes to get you motivated.""  O'Sullivan won the opening frame with an 88 break, but Hawkins, twice a beaten Masters finalist, replied with runs of 74, 56 and 47 to lead 3-2 shortly after the interval. However, the left-hander missed a string of good chances to extend his lead further and O'Sullivan, who has not won the title for seven years, pounced in typical predatory fashion to progress. Fine breaks of 77 and 60 allowed him to close out the match in style as he moved within two wins of the £250,000 first prize. ""That's the most awful standard of snooker,"" added O'Sullivan. ""I just said to Barry at the end: 'Sorry mate.' ""I've just got this ability with certain players where if I play bad, then they play even worse.  ""Some of the other guys will punish me, but I've just had it all through my life."" Hawkins was hammered 10-1 by O'Sullivan when the pair met in the 2017 Masters final and he had not beat him since the 2016 World Championship in Sheffield. His record of just three wins from 20 meetings between the pair didn't bode well - and so it proved as O'Sullivan, by no means at his best, registered yet another victory. ""I let him [Ronnie] off the hook - I had enough chances,"" said Hawkins. ""For some reason your mind wanders when you play Ronnie. I've got no complaints."" This video can not be played The Masters: Ronnie O'Sullivan explains why he apologised after beating Barry Hawkins Three-time Masters champion Steve Davis speaking on BBC Two It does seem, occasionally, Ronnie gets into the zone where he doesn't want to be bogged down with tactical play, so he prefers to be much more aggressive. In the end he did a good job. It always feels like Ronnie wants to entertain, but I don't think that's really the most important thing.  He'll probably feel he's let people down, but in the end he finished the job - and that's all that matters. But Barry Hawkins will be going back to his dressing room and saying: ""I had so many chances - and I threw them all away."" Murphy, the 2015 Masters champion, made his experience count as he beat Lisowski in commanding fashion to reach the semi-finals for the first time in four years. Breaks of 75, 131 and 76 allowed Murphy to take a 3-1 mid-session lead. A second century of the evening, this time 123, helped make it 5-1 as the former world champion moved within one frame of victory. Lisowski, who reached his first Masters semi-final last season, rallied to win the next two frames.  However, Murphy stood firm as he booked his place in a sixth Masters semi-final. ""You just never feel safe against Jack because he's a huge talent,"" Murphy told BBC Sport. ""When you play in front of a crowd like this, how can you not feel good?""  A deflated Lisowski said: ""I didn't feel great, but I just kept clinging on. Shaun finished strongly.""

Hawkish,Mother's plea for sea wall safety in wake of death,2024-09-25,2024-01-31,By John Ayres,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-68145806,"A Ukrainian mother who fled the war to come to the UK is calling on Network Rail to improve safety measures following the death of her daughter. Inna Yevko's daughter Albina, 14, fell to her death from the sea wall running alongside the railway line in Dawlish, Devon, in March 2023.  Ms Yevko, who fled her war-torn country in May 2022, wants handrails installed to prevent any future deaths. Network Rail said it was carrying out a risk assessment in the area. The company said it would be difficult to maintain handrails in ""the harsh coastal environment"". On 4 March 2023, Albina went for a walk to the shops at dusk and when she did not return her mother tried calling her numerous times, but she did not answer. LISTEN: Inna Yevko speaks to BBC Radio Devon about her daughter's death She was found on the beach and died at the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital the next day. Her mother and a friend, Rosie Dawson, who initially hosted the family in Dawlish, have launched a petition calling for improvements to safety measures including handrails. There had been a similar incident in 1992, which took the life of 17-year-old Brendan Burnage. ""We've begged Network Rail, please put up railings,"" said Ms Dawson. ""We've talked about lines. There used to be a line years ago which was left to crumble and disappear. There have never been lights. ""But even with lines and lights; and that is the very least; lines and lights wouldn't have saved Albina now,"" she said. Inna wants to make sure no other parent has to go through this. ""It's so, so hard,"" she said. ""I was a single mum and we were together. She was half of my life. Part of me is broken."" In a statement Network Rail said: ""We were saddened to hear of the passing of Albina Yevko and we've met with the family to express our condolences and discuss their concerns relating to the sea wall. ""Following the collapse of the sea wall in 2014, we conducted a risk assessment of the wall. ""Now that we have completed the new sea wall at Dawlish, a new risk assessment is under way to understand if there have been any changes which would affect the level of risk in this area. ""Handrails along all sections of the sea wall would be difficult to install and maintain effectively given the harsh coastal environment."" It added: ""All options will be considered as part of the new risk assessment."" Devon County Council has responsibility for the right of way of the path. A council spokesman said ""In March 1994 Devon County Council agreed funding towards additional signs and the trial use of a white line as a visual aid along the sea wall at the higher sections between Dawlish and Dawlish Warren. ""Coastal conditions soon eroded the white line and the trial was not subsequently adopted into maintenance regimes."" Ms Yevko is still waiting for Albina's inquest to conclude. For now she is hoping their campaign might help prevent an incident like this happening again.

Hawkish,What China's economic problems mean for the world,2024-09-25,2023-09-28,By Nick Marsh,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-66840367,"There is a saying that when the United States sneezes, the rest of the world catches a cold. But what happens when China is unwell?  The world's second-largest economy, home to more than 1.4 billion people, is facing a host of problems - including slow growth, high youth unemployment and a property market in disarray. Now the chairman of the country's heavily indebted real estate developer, Evergrande, has been placed under police surveillance and the company's shares have been suspended on the stock market. While these issues add up to a major headache for Beijing, how much does it matter to the rest of the world? Analysts believe worries of an impending global catastrophe are overstated. But multinational corporations, their workers and even people with no direct links to China are likely to feel at least some of the effects. Ultimately, it depends on who you are. ""If Chinese people start cutting back on eating out for lunch, for example, does that affect the global economy?"" asked Deborah Elms, executive director of the Asian Trade Centre in Singapore. ""The answer is not as much as you might imagine, but it certainly does hit firms who directly rely on domestic Chinese consumption."" Hundreds of big global companies such as Apple, Volkswagen and Burberry get a lot of their revenue from China's vast consumer market and will be hit by households spending less. The knock-on effects will then be felt by the thousands of suppliers and workers around the world who rely on these companies. When you consider that China is responsible for more than a third of the growth seen in the world, any kind of deceleration will be felt beyond its borders. The US credit rating agency Fitch said last month that China's slowdown was ""casting a shadow over global growth prospects"" and downgraded its forecast for the entire world in 2024. However, according to some economists, the idea that China is the engine of global prosperity has been exaggerated. ""Mathematically, yes, China accounts for around 40% of global growth,"" says George Magnus, an economist at the University of Oxford's China Centre. ""But who is that growth benefitting? China runs a huge trade surplus. It exports so much more than it imports, so how much China grows or doesn't grow is really more about China than it is about the rest of the world."" Nevertheless, China spending less on goods and services - or on housebuilding - means less demand for raw materials and commodities. In August, the country imported nearly 9% less compared to the same time last year - when it was still under zero-Covid restrictions. ""Big exporters such as Australia, Brazil and several countries in Africa will be hit hardest by this,"" says Roland Rajah, director of the Indo-Pacific Development Centre at the Lowy Institute in Sydney. Weak demand in China also means that prices there will stay low. From a Western consumer perspective, it would be a welcome way of curbing rising prices that does not involve further raising interest rates. ""This is good news for people and businesses struggling to deal with high inflation,"" Mr Rajah says. So in the short-term, ordinary consumers may benefit from China's slowdown. But there are longer term questions for people in the developing world. Over the last 10 years, China is estimated to have invested more than a trillion dollars in huge infrastructure projects known as the Belt and Road Initiative.  More than 150 countries have received Chinese money and technology to build roads, airports, seaports and bridges. According to Mr Rajah, Chinese commitment to these projects may start to suffer if economic problems persist at home. ""Now Chinese firms and banks won't have the same financial largesse to splash around overseas,"" he says. While reduced Chinese investment abroad is a possibility, it is unclear how else China's domestic economic situation will affect its foreign policy.  A more vulnerable China, some argue, may seek to repair damaged relations with the US. American trade restrictions have partly contributed to a 25% drop in Chinese exports to the US in the first half of this year, while US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo recently called the country ""uninvestable"" for some American firms. But there is no evidence to suggest China's approach is softening. Beijing continues to retaliate with restrictions of its own, frequently blasts the ""Cold War mentality"" of western countries and appears to maintain good relations with authoritarian leaders of sanctioned regimes, such as Russia's Vladimir Putin and Syria's Bashar Al-Assad. At the same time, a stream of US and EU officials continue to travel to China every month to keep up talks on bilateral trade. The truth is that few people really know what lies between Chinese rhetoric and Chinese policy. One of the more extreme readings of this uncertainty comes from hawkish observers in Washington, who say a downturn in the Chinese economy could impact how it deals with Taiwan, the self-governing island that Beijing claims as its own territory. Speaking earlier this month, Republican Congressman Mike Gallagher - chair of the US House Select Committee on China - said problems at home were making China's leader Xi Jinping ""less predictable"" and could lead him to ""do something very stupid"" with regards to Taiwan. The idea is that if, as Mr Rajah argues, it becomes apparent that China's ""economic miracle is over"", then the Communist Party's reaction ""could prove very consequential indeed"".  There are, however, plenty of people who dismiss this notion, including US President Joe Biden. When asked about this possibility, he said Mr Xi currently had his ""hands full"" dealing with the country's economic problems. ""I don't think it's going to cause China to invade Taiwan - matter of fact the opposite. China probably doesn't have the same capacity as it had before,"" Mr Biden said. However, if there is one lesson to learn from history, it is to expect the unexpected. As Ms Elms points out, few people before 2008 anticipated that subprime mortgages in Las Vegas would send shockwaves through the global economy. The echoes of 2008 have got some analysts worried about what is known as ""financial contagion"". This includes the nightmare scenario of China's property crisis leading to a full-blown collapse in the Chinese economy, triggering financial meltdown around the world. Parallels with the subprime mortgage crisis - which saw the collapse of Wall Street investment giant Lehman Brothers and a global recession - are certainly tempting to make. But, according to Mr Magnus, they are not completely accurate. ""This is not going to be a Lehman-type shock,"" he says. ""China is unlikely to let their big banks go bust - and they have stronger balance sheets than the thousands of regional and community banks that went under in the US."" Ms Elms agrees: ""China's property market is not linked to their financial infrastructure in the same way that American subprime mortgages were. Besides, China's financial system is not dominant enough for there to be a direct global impact like we saw from the United States in 2008."" ""We are globally interconnected,"" she says. ""When you have one of the large engines of growth not functioning it affects the rest of us, and it often affects the rest of us in ways that weren't anticipated."" ""It doesn't mean I think we're headed for a repeat of 2008, but the point is that what sometimes appear to be local, domestic concerns can have an effect on us all. Even in ways that we wouldn't have imagined."""
Hawkish,Decade on from Dawlish railway devastation,2024-09-25,2024-02-04,By Zhara Simpson,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-68180709,"Ten years have passed since a powerful storm battered the South West of England, leading to the evacuation of homes and the destruction of a railway line. The tracks at Dawlish were left dangling by the force of the storm that began on the evening of 4 February 2014, cutting off the coastal town's only railway line to the rest of the region for eight weeks. Its sea wall had survived three recent storms but the latest proved too much for the defences to withstand as huge waves crashed over the top. About 50 people were evacuated from their homes that night. Among them was Peter Large and his family. They lived nearby in a three-storey house and were evacuated after 23:00 GMT. Mr Large compared the storm to a ""giant taking a sledgehammer to the front of the houses"". He said: ""You could see flashing lights. We had a knock at the door to say we had 10 minutes to evacuate. ""The sea wall was gone; we were worried there was a good chance the houses were going to go with it."" By John Ayres, BBC Spotlight The collapse of the sea wall at Dawlish initially started in the evening. I was in Looe, Cornwall, as the town had suffered really bad flooding, so I was staying in a hotel expecting to broadcast live from there in the morning. Instead, I received a call in the middle of the night saying: ""Get to Dawlish now, the railway has fallen into the sea!""   When we arrived in Dawlish, we couldn't go to the actual location where the wall had collapsed because it was too dark, unsafe and inaccessible. Residents had been evacuated from their homes.  We pitched up in town along the front near the station but ballast from the railway was being tossed by the waves up into the air.  It was raining rocks in Marine Parade so we had to relocate to a safe position.  Fortunately, as it began to get light the storm did ease back a bit although it was still pretty hairy. We positioned ourselves in the underpass between the road and the beach.  Although our first live broadcast was fine, I was ordered to relocate before the next one because there were fears viewers would complain, saying the scene was too dangerous.    Sea water was pouring through the underpass and out onto the road behind us. As the day went on the number of media outlets outside Dawlish station grew and grew, forming quite a media village.  After a night of being pounded by both the wind, rain and sea it was a relief to finally have a full breakfast - although that was only the beginning of the day.  Steve Briers, a cameraman who shot the devastation on the morning of 5 February, called 999 to alert emergency services. ""Every wave that came in was taking another section of the road out,"" he said. ""I thought it was a matter of time before the houses just went into the sea as well. ""I was very aware that I was now on an island. I remember it being a very busy morning."" Those evacuated were directed to a nearby guest house, Sea Lawn Lodge, where people arrived with blankets around their shoulders. Val Belcher, from the guest house, said: ""People had five minutes to get out their houses. I made them tea and coffee and they had to go through to our dining room. ""The police were there and took all the information they needed.""  Ten years on, Network Rail said a £165m package of resilience measures had been built, funded by the Department for Transport. It said the measures were ""proving to be effective"". Network Rail said the programme had delivered a stronger, taller sea wall for Dawlish and a new footbridge with lifts since 2019. Rail Minister Huw Merriman said: ""Thanks to more than £165m of government funding to restore and protect this vital stretch of railway, its future is now secured. ""This will provide residents with peace of mind - the line is better protected, no matter the weather."" Andy Bowes-Roden, deputy editor of Modern Railways, said the South West received among the lowest transport spends per head in the country. He said: ""In transport terms I think the government has let the South West down catastrophically. ""We've had billions spent in London, we're having billions spent in the Midlands, billions promised for the North. ""There was an integrated rail plan for £96bn for the Midlands and the North.   ""Now for a tiny fraction of that money, we could have that additional route between Exeter and Plymouth. ""We could strengthen our coastal railway, we could upgrade existing routes, we could expand bus services.""         Follow BBC Devon on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

Hawkish,Housemate 'stabbed student in music row' - court,2024-09-25,2024-04-12,By Pritti Mistry,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-humber-68797523,"Warning: This report contains offensive language. A student was stabbed to death by a housemate after an argument over the victim's taste in music escalated into violence, a court has heard. Sachin Hawkins died after he was fatally stabbed at the shared house he was staying in, on Hardy Street, Hull, on 15 November 2023. Syed Hussain-Kazi, 25, of Hardy Street, denies murder. Hull Crown Court heard the 19-year-old was ""stabbed through the heart"" with a 6in-long (15cm) bladed knife. Prosecutor Sharon Beattie told the jury of eight women and four men Mr Hawkins had been playing music and was standing in the doorway in the kitchen when Mr Hussain-Kazi, who had been drinking, ""started poking fun at his taste in music"". ""The defendant called him a faggot. Sachin replied back calling him a bitch,"" said Ms Beattie. ""They usually called each other names in a jokey way. ""On this day, however, it escalated when the defendant replied: 'what did you call me?'"" It was at this point Mr Hussain-Kazi stabbed the 19-year-old in the chest, the court heard. ""Sachin said 'he just stabbed me' and dropped to the floor,"" the prosecutor told the court. Mr Hussain-Kazi repeatedly retorted ""who's the bitch now?"" as another housemate held him back, the jury heard. The defendant was later heard by another saying ""I need to go"" before picking up his jacket and stepping over Mr Hawkins while uttering ""I'm sorry"" before leaving the house, the court was told. Following his arrest, Mr Hussain-Kazi denied murder and told police he ""had no intention to cause Sachin any harm"" and that he was ""my friend"", the prosecutor said. The jury heard there were previous concerns over the 25-year-old's behaviour, including an occasion in November 2022 at university halls of residence where he scared first-year flatmates when he ""started swinging a 30cm knife"" in front of a student's face, jurors heard. At the time Mr Hawkins had tried to talk him down and students believed the incident was ""drink-related"". ""The defendant has a tendency to pick up knives to intimidate others with little reason to do so"", said Ms Beattie. Jurors heard the pair met in their first year at the University of Hull and had been living together in the same halls. They formed a friendship and later moved together with three other friends into a student house on Hardy Street in August 2023. Mr Hawkins was originally from London but moved to America with his mother. He later decided to return to the UK. The 19-year-old was training to be a special education teacher.

Hawkish,‘How I played Stephen Hawking’,2024-09-25,2014-10-21,Unknown,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20140926-how-i-played-stephen-hawking,"The Theory of Everything tells the story of Stephen Hawking’s struggle with motor neurone disease. Tom Brook talks to the film’s star Eddie Redmayne. He was diagnosed with motor neurone disease at the age of 21, and told he only had two years to live. But Stephen Hawking went on to become one of the most respected theoretical physicists in the world, still lecturing at 72. A new film – starring Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones – is inspired by the memoir by Hawking’s ex-wife Jane.

Hawkish,The ‘Girl with no Brain’?,2024-09-25,2016-10-07,Nicholas Barber,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20161006-the-girl-on-the-train-has-ideas-above-its-station,"Emily Blunt stars in an adaptation of the best-selling thriller by Paula Hawkins. But the film fails to pick up speed, writes Nicholas Barber. Paula Hawkins’ novel, The Girl on the Train, has sold 15 million copies around the world, largely due to its irresistible concept. Its heroine, Rachel, is a miserable, alcoholic divorcee who gazes at the same house twice every day when she commutes by train between London and suburbia. She likes to imagine that the man and woman she sees in that house have an idyllic marriage, just as she used to do when she lived nearby, before her inability to get pregnant drove her away from her husband and towards the bottle. But her illusions about this seemingly perfect couple are shattered when she spots the woman, Megan, kissing another man. The next day Megan vanishes, and Rachel fears that she might have been involved. The problem is, she was so drunk on the night of the disappearance, she can’t remember what she did, or how she ended up so badly cut and bruised. It’s a gripping Rear-Window-on-wheels premise, but it’s surprising how little the novel makes of it. Rachel doesn’t do much detective work herself: she mopes around for three hundred pages until her memories conveniently return, and then she mopes around for a hundred pages after that. What worse is that nothing is at stake for her, given that she is already at rock bottom, nor is she in any danger. That is, she isn’t in any danger until she stupidly throws herself in harm’s way, because the book wouldn’t have had a climax otherwise. If that weren’t irritating enough, she isn’t a girl - she’s in her thirties - and the fact that she sometimes travels by train turns out to be barely relevant. “The Woman with no Brain” would have been a more appropriate title. Still, the shortcomings of the book aren’t necessarily a bad thing, as far as a film version is concerned. David Fincher struggled with two “Girl” adaptations - The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and Gone Girl - because there was too much in the novels for him to cram into two hours. The Girl on the Train, on the other hand, is so hollow that there is plenty of space for a film-maker to fill with interesting detail. That hasn’t happened. Directed by Tate Taylor (The Help) and written by Erin Cressida Wilson (Secretary), the dreary, fragmentary adaptation takes everything that was wrong with Hawkins’ book and makes it worse. If you’ve read the novel, you’ll be annoyed by the changes, and if you haven’t read it you’ll wonder how it ever became a bestseller in the first place. On the wrong track A few of those changes have clear commercial reasons. The action, such as it is, has been shifted from London’s suburbs to New York’s, the houses have become bigger and more enviable, and the heroine - who is repeatedly described in the book as being overweight and unattractive - is played by Emily Blunt, who hardly fits either description, even with the smudged eyeliner which the film uses to signify that she is a gin-swigging wreck. A few other changes are simply baffling: why, for instance, does Megan’s therapist (Edgar Ramirez) have a Balkan name as he does in the novel, when he is Hispanic onscreen? And why has Rachel been turned into an accomplished artist when her drawings have no bearing on the story? And there are other changes which aren’t just baffling, but perverse. They seem designed to make the film less cinematic, not more. For a start, the film breaks the show-don’t-tell rule of cinema several times per minute. When we first see Rachel, she explains who she is and how she feels in ponderous voiceover. Then when she sees Megan (Hayley Bennett) smooching with someone who isn’t her husband, the film-makers don’t trust Blunt’s acting to convey her reaction, so they have her saying, “Who is that man? What is she doing?” And it’s not just Rachel. While the vast majority of the novel is narrated by her, the film divides its running time more evenly between Rachel, Megan, and Anna (Rebecca Ferguson), the woman who is now married to Rachel’s ex-husband Tom (Justin Theroux) – and they all keep spelling out what’s on their minds. They are either talking to themselves in voiceover, or talking to their babies, or talking to their therapist, or talking to a police detective (Allison Janney) who investigates the case without actually doing anything. Moments that should have been dramatic turning points, such as when Rachel steels herself to contact Megan’s brawny husband (Luke Evans), are missed out altogether, apparently because the film-makers were so keen to get back to the three women pontificating about their lives and their memories while tears roll down their cheeks. Sitting through The Girl on the Train is less like watching a propulsive mystery film than listening to a radio play while looking at pictures of sad people. The endless cutting between different narrators with different perspectives also means that, instead of picking up speed, this particular train chugs back and forth along the same stretch of track, stopping at every station along the way. There are flashbacks, and flashbacks within flashbacks, but we never seem to be getting any closer to the destination, that is, finding out what happened to Megan. What’s frustrating is that if you stare at The Girl on the Train hard enough, you can just about make out what the writer and director were trying to do. Rather than contenting themselves with anything as lowly as entertaining an audience, they were attempting to fashion an intricately patterned mosaic that drew parallels between the three central women, and which commented on cycles of abuse and denial. It was a noble aim, sort of, but Hawkins’ trashy material would have been better suited to a lurid 1990s erotic thriller. That, at least, might have been fun. As it is, The Girl on the Train has ideas above its station. ★★☆☆☆ If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.

Hawkish,Can anything stop Eddie Redmayne?,2024-09-25,2015-02-19,Unknown,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20150219-can-anything-stop-eddie-redmayne,"Most Oscars-watchers agree that Eddie Redmayne is sure to carry off the best actor award at this year’s Academy Awards. Tom Brook talks to him about bringing Stephen Hawking to the screen. As the 87th Academy Awards draw nearer, Eddie Redmayne has emerged as the clear front-runner in the best actor category. His portrayal of Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything has already won him prizes at the Baftas, Golden Globes and Screen Actors’ Guild awards and he now looks almost certain to carry off a statuette at the Oscars ceremony on Sunday. Redmayne has been widely praised for the depth of his performance in his most high-profile role to date. Before landing the part, Redmayne was best known for playing supporting characters in Simon Curtis’ My Week with Marilyn and as Marius in Tom Hooper’s Les Misérables from 2012. He talks to Tom Brook about his excitement on learning of his Oscar nomination, and the difficulty in bringing the character of Stephen Hawking to the screen without trivialising the astrophysicist’s struggle.

Hawkish,Is The Post another Spielberg triumph?,2024-09-25,2017-12-19,Caryn James,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20171218-film-review-is-the-post-another-spielberg-triumph,"Meryl Streep and Tom  Hanks star in a new film about the 1971 Pentagon Papers scandal. It's the director's ""most Capra-esque movie ever"" writes Caryn James. A stirring defence of freedom of the press, The Post arrives at a time when the words 'fake news' echo through almost every political conversation. Director Steven Spielberg rushed the project into production because its story, set in 1971 when President Richard Nixon ruled like a crime boss, speaks so potently to the world today. Washington Post editor Ben Bradlee and publisher Katharine Graham (Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep) defy the Nixon administration and publish the classified Pentagon Papers, revealing the government’s lies about the war in Vietnam. The Post is also Spielberg’s most Capra-esque movie ever, with all the positive and negative qualities that suggests. Spielberg, like Frank Capra, is a master of pop entertainment. Here he delivers a fast-paced story laced with moments to cheer for, full of undeniable heroes. But the movie is also earnest and corny, annoying in the way it  spoon-feeds the audience its blatant message and tries to stage-manage our emotional responses. - Is The Last Jedi the best of Star Wars? - Margot Robbie deserves a gold for I, Tonya - The Disaster Artist is an uproarious farce Hanks and Streep bring their movie-star charisma and best character work to the roles. They lift the film above a screenplay that is pedestrian but clear, and which begins by giving us historical context. In 1966, Daniel Ellsberg (Matthew Rhys), who would ultimately leak the papers from the think tank where he works, observes Defense Secretary Robert McNamara (Bruce Greenwood) privately rage at the fact that the United States is stalled in Vietnam. Minutes later McNamara assures the press, “In every respect, we’re making progress.” Today it’s assumed that politicians lie and obfuscate. The Post takes us back to a day when that occurrence seemed like news. Cut to a few years later in 1971 and Bradlee is trying to elevate The Washington Post from its lowly status as a local paper. No one could have known that Woodward and Bernstein would break open the Watergate scandal for the Post just a few years later. Without overplaying, Hanks’ Bradlee struts, growls and is always the smartest, biggest personality in the room. Hanks conveys the glee Bradlee feels at getting a scoop, his integrity (he will not let Nixon hand-pick a reporter to cover his daughter’s White House wedding), and above all the birddog instinct of a true newsman. Graham, whose finishing school accent suits her helmet hair and ladylike wardrobe, had become the unlikely and uneasy publisher of the family-run paper after her husband’s suicide. With her typical wizardry, Streep captures both Graham’s determination and the deep insecurity she must overcome with every new challenge (chronicled beautifully in her Pulitzer Prize-winning autobiography, Personal History). After the New York Times begins publishing the Papers, the government gets an injunction preventing it from releasing more. Bradlee sees a chance to jump into the story despite the danger: he and Graham might be charged with treason for printing classified information. Spielberg wonderfully recreates the dynamic of a newsroom: the buzz of energy, the abrupt conversations, the shared sense of pride when something goes right. And he surrounds his stars with a vibrant cast. Among the best: Carrie Coon as editorial writer Meg Greenfield and Bob Odenkirk as assistant managing editor Ben Bagdikian, a weary-looking veteran journalist who makes a crucial connection with Ellsberg. And the film creates tension in low-stakes settings. Sprawled out on Bradlee’s living room floor, a team of reporters pieces together the undated pages of the secret papers Bagdikian has delivered, racing against a deadline, wondering if Graham will defy her own lawyers and give the go-ahead to publish. But the film wastes its most intriguing opportunities. Bradlee belatedly realises, and confides to Graham, that his prized friendship with President John F Kennedy was not on equal terms after all, that the editor might have been used. But The Post zooms past that thorny, fascinating issue so Hanks can deliver one of the film’s blunt lessons about politicians: “The way they lied. Those days have to be over.” Streep’s performance saves the film from its own heavy-handedness. The first version of the script was by Liz Hannah, who was inspired by Graham’s trajectory as a woman coming into her own. Spielberg brought on Josh Singer, the screenwriter of Spotlight. However the writers worked together, the seams between the feminist story and the journalism story are conspicuous. Almost all the scenes about progress for women are ham-fisted in construction and feel shoehorned in. In the midst of the Pentagon Papers crisis, Graham speaks to her grown daughter (Alison Brie), who is putting her own young daughter to bed. In that maternal episode, Graham admits that she never thought she’d even have a job, much less run the company. “I thought that was the way it was supposed to be. Everybody thought that way then.” Still uncertain of herself, she tearfully says she does not want it to be her fault if the paper goes under. Streep is magnificently nuanced; there is no need for John Williams’ mawkish music to intrude and tell us that this is meant to be a touching moment.   And when Graham walks out of the Supreme Court after a hearing about whether the Post can publish the Papers, she descends the steps and rows of women – only women – conveniently step aside as if she has just parted the Red Sea.  The Post lives in the long shadow of All the President’s Men, a far better film that turned Woodward and Bernstein’s reporting into a sophisticated thriller. Spielberg has created a well-crafted message movie, which raises a question haunting all message movies: who, exactly, is the audience, apart from the like-minded viewers it is preaching to? Graham gets her big empowered moment when she tells a sexist board member, “This is no longer my father’s company, it’s no longer my husband’s company, it is my company.” But the most Capra-esque episode – think of Jimmy Stewart on the Senate floor in Mr Smith Goes to Washington – goes to Coon. In the crowded newsroom, Greenfield takes a phone call and relays the Supreme Court ruling allowing publication of the Papers. “The Founding Fathers gave the free press the protection it must have to fulfill its essential role in our democracy,” she says. It is a scene effectively calculated to cause viewers to cheer, and perhaps get a little weepy as they realize how precarious that freedom seems today.   Even as The Post warns about the threats to journalism, though, it offers hope. When the president rails against the press, he is seen from a distance, a shadowy figure in the White House. But the voice Spielberg uses is authentically Nixon’s own, from his once-secret tapes. Nixon did everything he could to silence the press. We know how that turned out. ★★★☆☆  If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.

Hawkish,Why tyrants love to write poetry,2024-09-25,2017-10-25,Benjamin Ramm,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20171025-why-tyrants-love-to-write-poetry,"Nero, Stalin and Bin Laden were all fans, but what makes verse so appealing to these leaders? Benjamin Ramm explores the connection between ruthlessness and sentimentality. Poetry is an art of refinement, synonymous with delicacy and sensitivity. It seems counterintuitive that it might also be a celebration of brutality, and the art form beloved of tyrants. But from classical antiquity to modernity, dictators have been inspired to write verse – seeking solace, intimacy, or glory. Their work informs us about the nature of power, the abiding appeal of poetry, and the perils of artistic interpretation. The archetype of the poet-tyrant is Roman emperor Nero (37-68 CE), the vain, self-pitying exhibitionist whose debased rule mirrored his deficient art. Nero’s historiographers, Tacitus and Suetonius, suggest that Rome was as tormented by his poetry as by his policies. Derision is a satisfying form of critical revenge, but these accounts raise a troubling question: would the tyrant’s crimes be mitigated were his art deemed to have merit; and conversely, can we judge fairly the quality of a tyrant’s poetry? -       The lost Arab poetry that lives on in Hebrew -       The words that can make us calmer -       The writers who defied Soviet censors As the scholar Ulrich Gotter points out in the recently published volume Tyrants Writing Poetry, in comparison to poet-emperors Caesar and Augustus, Nero’s reign was ""remarkably bloodless"". Yet despite his lack of military ambition, Nero’s vengeful deeds were high-profile, and our image of him is of a pathetic despot, wearing a tragic stage costume, singing of the capture of Troy while his imperial city burned to the ground; Suetonius quotes Nero as “being greatly delighted with the beauty of the flames”. Nero revelled in performance: in Rome he inaugurated an elaborate Hellenic-inspired festival, the Neronia, and during a tour of Greece he participated in competitions of poetry, song and lyre-playing, as well as charioteering. (At Olympia, he was thrown from his 10-horse chariot but was still crowned the winner by fawning, fearful judges). Nero insisted that the statues of previous winners be ripped off their pedestals, and he returned to Rome with 1,808 prizes. This portrait of the poet as megalomaniac, forging the world from his delusional imagination, provided inspiration for artists such as the Marquis de Sade and the Nobel prize-winning author Henryk Sienkiewicz, whose 1896 novel Quo Vadis became an iconic Technicolor film starring Peter Ustinov. Nero even sought to choreograph his final performance – his own botched suicide. He rehearsed and performed his farewell phrase: qualis artifex pereo (“what an artist dies with me”). ‘The magic power of the spoken word’    Almost two thousand years later, a group of Italian poets prefigured fascism with a Neronian celebration of the spectacle of destruction. ‘Let art flourish, though the world perish’ was one of the slogans of the Italian Futurists, founded by poet Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, who fetishised war as ‘the only cure for the world’. Marinetti sought to industrialise and militarise language with ‘concrete poetry’, written by a creator-aggressor who would ‘begin by brutally destroying syntax’. The Futurists had been influenced by poet-warrior Gabriele D’Annunzio, a revered figure who set up a short-lived ‘lyrical dictatorship’ in 1919, which inspired Mussolini’s seizure of power three years later. Despite professing enthusiasm for D’Annunzio’s ‘mystical union’ of poet and people, Mussolini’s own verse was prone to mawkish resignation. There was a degree of pretence in his literary ambition: his biographer Richard Bosworth notes that Mussolini left the works of eminent poets “ostentatiously open on his desk when being visited by foreign dignitaries”. His later poetry reflected his isolation, far from the idealism of his socialist youth, which produced verses that lamented the fall of Jacobinism (“the axe bloodied in plebeian veins”) and yearned for revolutionary prophecy (“In his dying eyes flashed the Idea, / The vision of centuries to come”). Inevitably, dictators channel their artistic disappointments into politics. Hitler, despite proclaiming a preference for ‘the magic power of the spoken word’ against ‘the syrupy effusions of aesthetic litterateurs’, once imagined himself a Viennese bohemian. Goebbels, who perfected the art form of propaganda, wrote a novel with expressionistic traits, while Pol Pot, educated in Paris, was an admirer of Verlaine’s Symbolist poetry. Russian Marxism initiated a wave of radical aesthetic movements, but the poet-tyrant of the Soviet Union wrote in a strikingly conservative style. The young Stalin composed poetry in Georgian – a language banned at the Orthodox seminary where he trained – and his work reproduces romantic motifs, of the rebellious poet and the lost Golden Age. Stalin’s verses are characterised by artful imitation, a lack of self-irony, and “exaggerated ardour”, according to critic Evgeny Dobrenko. With an ornamental elegance bordering on kitsch, Stalin’s poetry brims with naturalistic clichés: “under a grove in the azure rings the warble of a nightingale”, as the soul is tormented by “the dark forest of the night”. It is earnest, if politically crude: Know for certain that once  Struck down to the ground, an oppressed man  Strives again to reach the pure mountain,  When exalted by hope. In Over This Land (1895), an artist bestows revelatory music to the masses: The voice made many a man’s heart  Beat, that had been turned to stone;  It enlightened many a man’s mind  Which had been cast into uttermost darkness. But the prophet is unrecognised by those he seeks to liberate: “The mob set before the outcast / A vessel filled with poison”. Stalin reappears as a singer in a later poem, “moved to tears by the bitter lot of the peasant”, as he – with foresight – “erected a monument to himself… in the heart of every Georgian”. Published anonymously, Stalin’s poetry featured in prestigious literary journals and was anthologised as an exemplar of Georgian classical literature. Indeed, even Stalin’s most critical biographers have praise for his verses: Simon Sebag-Montefiore wrote that “their beauty lies in the rhythm and language” (difficult to convey in translation), while Robert Service claims that the work possesses “a linguistic purity recognised by all”. Its decorative prettiness and heroic posturing would reappear in Stalin’s championing of socialist realism, against an experimental modernist avant-garde. Pen and sword Stalin’s spiritual heir, Yuri Andropov, combined the bureaucratic with the romantic. As head of the KGB, he persecuted dissidents and crushed the Hungarian uprising, while writing love poems to his wife. (The ability to compartmentalise is an essential trait of the creator-dictator). The Uzbek poet Hamid Ismailov tells a revealing anecdote of Andropov: one of his speechwriters sent him a birthday card, in which he joked that power corrupts people, to which Andropov replied with a chilling verse: Once a villain blurted out  that power corrupts people.  Now all pundits repeat it  For so many years  Without noticing (alas!)  That more often people corrupt the power. Another avowed Stalinist, the North Korean leader Kim Il-sung, was attributed the authorship of revolutionary plays and theoretical work, most notably ‘seed theory’, which presents Kim as the sire of artistic invention. In 1992, Kim Sr wrote a public poem to his son, Jong-il: Can it be the Shining Star’s fiftieth birthday already? Admired by all for his power of pen and sword  Combined with his loyal and filial mind,  And unanimous praise and cheers shake heaven and earth. Kim, father of the nation, was heralded as the ‘Sun of the Nation’, in the manner of Mao Zedong (‘the Red Sun in our Hearts’). It is Mao who embodied the pen-and-sword ideal of a ruler, based on a unity of cultural ability (wen) with martial prowess (wu). Mao sought to appropriate the imperial tradition while transcending it, noting in a 1936 poem that few emperors had left a literary legacy: now “truly great men / Look to this age alone”. Mao’s poetry is orthodox in form and classical in theme, a performance of the tradition he purported to despise. Despite his own injunction to destroy the Four Olds (culture, customs, habits, ideas), Mao wrote in the old style, even when it had been denounced as elitist and outdated. “I feared the spread of such errors could lead the youth astray”, confided Mao to a magazine editor, but he indulged his own tastes nonetheless, even as he forbade others. Mao luxuriated in language, proving adept with imagery (“The rolling hills sea-blue, / The dying sun blood-red”) and classical themes (“Man’s world is mutable, seas become mulberry fields”), in turns epigrammatic (“Bitter sacrifice strengthens bold resolve”) and propagandistic (“China’s daughters have high-aspiring minds, / They love their battle-array, not silks and satins”). Mao’s work is proof that artistic refinement is no guarantee of a gentler politics. In 1966, Red Guards supplemented their Little Red Book with a collection of 25 poems attributed to Mao, which led to an enthusiasm for old style verses among those dedicated to destroying “feudal relics”. The last line that Mao ever wrote, a year before launching the Cultural Revolution, was a premonition of the coming tumult: “Look, the world is being turned upside down”. ‘Censor and creator’ Poetry has been entered as incriminating evidence at the International Criminal Court, where Radovan Karadžić, the ‘Butcher of Bosnia’, was found guilty of genocide. A 1992 BBC documentary captured a meeting between Karadžić and the nationalist Russian poet Eduard Limonov, in which Karadžić recites a poem that prophesies violence and Limonov fires a volley of bullets into the valley below. Karadžić claims to have anticipated the battle years beforehand, and his 1971 poem Sarajevo contains the lines: The town burns like a piece of incense  In the smoke rumbles our consciousness… I know that all of these are the preparations of the scream:  What does the black metal in the garage have for us? Establishing intention on the part of a perpetrator is a requirement under international law. Karadžić was a key figure in what Slavoj Žižek terms the ‘poetic-military complex’, which venerated the literary canon of nationalism, particularly Petar Petrović-Njegoš’ epic poem The Mountain Wreath (1847), in which the shedding of Muslim blood is presented as an act of baptism for the Serb nation. The rhetoric of genocide is cloaked in anodyne metaphor: a nation ‘purified’ through ‘ethnic cleansing’. Yet readers must also be aware of the perils of treating an artistic persona as the author’s own. Consider the work of Ayatollah Khomeini, whose Persian poetry channels the spirit of Sufi seers Rumi and Hafez: I am a supplicant for a goblet of wine  from the hand of a sweetheart.  In whom can I confide this secret of mine?  Where can I take this sorrow? These lyrics are difficult to reconcile with Khomeini’s public persona: I have become imprisoned, O beloved, by the mole on your lip!   I saw your ailing eyes and became ill through love… Open the door of the tavern and let us go there day and night,   For I am sick and tired of the mosque and seminary.    The ayatollah’s devotees are keen to read these verses strictly allegorically (‘The mosque and the preacher are the empty display of outward religiosity’) – although some lines are difficult to neuter: “I have torn off the garb of asceticism and hypocrisy”. The poems reveal the ayatollah as a mystic, albeit one who can issue a fatwa, making him both censor and creator. The raid on Osama bin Laden’s compound in 2011 prompted media commentary about his bookshelf, focusing on the absence of fiction and neglecting to mention his fondness for poetry. In 2010, bin Laden wrote to a lieutenant with details of an ambitious plot, before adding a request: “if there are any brothers with you who know about poetic metres, please inform me, and if you have any books on the science of classical prosody, please send them to me”. Bin Laden was among the most celebrated jihadi poets, and his status derived in part from his mastery of classical eloquence. Bin Laden’s emir in Iraq, Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi, was known simultaneously as ‘the butcher’ and ‘he who weeps a lot’ – illuminating the link between ruthlessness and sentimentality, the twin desire for power and pity. Al-Qaeda’s current leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri, also writes poetry, and the self-proclaimed caliph of so-called Islamic State, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, wrote his PhD thesis on a religious poem. One tyrant who wrote poetry to the bitter end was Saddam Hussein. His 2013 prison poem is composed in a clumsy vernacular: “You are the soothing breeze / My soul is made fresh by you / And our Baath Party blossoms like a branch turns green”. Saddam, who liked to pose with a Kalashnikov, exhibits his trademark defiance: “Here we unveil our chests to the wolves”. Intriguingly, the man who invented the rifle, Mikhail Kalashnikov, himself wanted to be a poet. As WH Auden wrote in an epitaph of Hitler, “the poetry he invented was easy to understand”.

Hawkish,Churchill ‘brought to vigorous life’,2024-09-25,2017-11-21,Nicholas Barber,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20171117-film-review-darkest-hour,"Gary Oldman’s portrayal of Winston Churchill in Darkest Hour could put him in contention for an Oscar, writes critic Nicholas Barber. Spoiler alert! In June 1940, a flotilla of civilian boats rescued thousands of British troops from a beach in northern France, and Winston Churchill, one of the men responsible for the rescue, went on to lead Britain to victory against Germany. Actually, maybe it’s not much of a spoiler. However many school history lessons you may have skipped, you probably know that, on balance, Churchill did better than Hitler in World War Two. But Joe Wright’s Darkest Hour is so breathlessly tense that at times you may forget how well the Dunkirk evacuation went. You may even forget the rest of Churchill’s triumphs. In parts of this propulsive, well-appointed and wonderfully acted period drama, his situation is so precarious it doesn’t look as if he’ll last the year, let alone the war. Never mind his battles with Hitler and Mussolini, his battles with politicians in his own party are testing enough. As the massive on-screen captions tell us, the story begins in May 1940, when three million German troops reach the Belgian border. Over in Britain, parliament has lost faith in the terminally ill Conservative prime minister, Neville Chamberlain (Ronald Pickup). Conservative grandees hand the top job to Churchill (Gary Oldman), because he is the only candidate the opposition party will accept. But they have their doubts about following a fat old eccentric whose decisions led to catastrophic losses in the Gallipoli campaign in World War One, and whose blood is now equal parts champagne, whisky and bacon fat. Churchill has barely unpacked his suitcases in 10 Downing Street before Chamberlain and the Earl of Halifax (Stephen Dillane) start plotting to turf him out again. And the more pugnacious his anti-Hitler rhetoric gets, the more certain they are that negotiating with Hitler might not be such a bad idea.  Luckily for Churchill, he has the support of his wide-eyed secretary (Lily James), a working-class angel who informs him that when he does his ‘V for Victory’ hand gesture the wrong way round, it translates as: “Up your bum.” He also has the indefatigable loyalty of his no-nonsense wife Clementine (Kristin Scott Thomas), who – like so many big-screen heroines – is there to give the hero pep talks while tying his bow tie. But Churchill’s idiosyncrasies and stubbornness worry everyone else, up to and including King George VI (an amusingly exasperated Ben Mendelson). When the King proposes that they should schedule their weekly meetings for 4:00 pm, Churchill retorts that that’s impossible: four o’clock is when he takes his nap. While Christopher Nolan’s prodigious Dunkirk dramatised the retreat from France, and ignored all of the planning that preceded it, Darkest Hour does the opposite. Having staged a breathtaking five-minute tracking shot along Dunkirk’s beach in Atonement, Wright may well have felt that he couldn’t possibly top it. And so, there is one brief shot of the legendary ‘little ships’ setting sail from England, and a few glimpses of hellish French battlefields, but the film concentrates on middle-aged men arguing with each other in rooms filled with cigar smoke. Nonetheless, Wright treats his talky political drama as if it were a pulse-pounding action movie. Thanks to Bruno Delbonnel’s flashy camerawork, Valerio Bonelli’s snappy editing and Anthony McCarten’s punchy, funny dialogue, the debates have the impact of explosions, and Churchill’s strolls through his headquarters have the hurtling momentum of a car chase. Unsurprisingly, much of the film’s boisterous energy is generated by its tremendous central performance - as dampened as it is by the leading man’s prosthetic jowls. The result of all that cutting-edge make-up is that Oldman doesn’t look much like himself, but he doesn’t look much like Churchill, either. And yet the actor’s twinkle-eyed gusto brings the prime minister to vigorous life. He is a force of nature who can overflow with anger and guffawing jollity, sometimes within the same sentence, but who can also be paralysed by depression. It’s not a wholly flattering portrayal. What is so clever about the film is that, while we tend to assume that Churchill’s hawkish policies were the right ones, and that his opponents were deluded cowards, Darkest Hour isn’t quite so sure. The hero’s rants about fighting to the last man can seem dangerously fanatical, and Halifax’s measured pleas on behalf of peace talks can seem persuasively sensible. It’s not that you’re ever on Halifax’s side, exactly – Dillane is too smooth and lizardy for that – but you can see why people might not have been on Churchill’s side, either. Towards the end, though, the script’s balance is upset by two clunking scenes. First, there is a late-night bonding session with King George, a cosy tête-à-tête that suggests the royal family saved Britain from the Nazis. Then comes an all-too-convenient meeting with a focus group of cheery cockneys, who assure Churchill that they’re behind him all the way. These hokey sequences, along with a few other clichéd ones, drag Darkest Hour down from a great film to a good one. But there is definitely greatness in the way Oldman takes a role that has already been played by so many actors, and makes it utterly his own. Don’t bet against him flashing that ‘V For Victory’ sign on Oscar night. ★★★★☆  If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.

Hawkish,22 films to watch in 2022,2024-09-25,2022-01-07,Nicholas Barber and Caryn James,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20220106-22-films-to-watch-in-2022,"From a psychological thriller starring Harry Styles and Florence Pugh, to Robert Pattinson as The Batman, and sequels to Avatar and Knives Out, our critics pick the best releases slated for 2022. A Hero With its intentionally ambiguous title, A Hero is a work from one of today's masters, Asghar Farhadi. Two of his most stirring films, A Separation and The Salesman, each won the Oscar for best foreign language film (before the category was renamed), and this latest is shortlisted for this year's award. Once more his characters embody the clash of tradition, morality, politics and a changing society in today's Iran. With Farhadi's usual eloquence and precise, intimate observation, the story follows Rahim, a flawed but hugely sympathetic man imprisoned for debt. When he gets two days' leave and tries to find a way out of that debt, a small act of dishonesty spirals out of control, and the glare of social media enhances his problems. (Caryn James) Released in the US on 7 January Belle This cyberpunk update of Beauty and the Beast received a 14-minute standing ovation when it premiered at last May's Cannes Film Festival – and it's easy to see why. Mamoru Hosoda's dazzling anime is a fairy-tale romance, a high-school soap opera, a superhero action movie and a science-fiction mystery all rolled into one. More than that, the film is a technical marvel in which every frame sparkles with a seemingly infinite array of tiny details. Its heroine is a Japanese schoolgirl who is too shy to sing in real life, but becomes a world-famous pop star in a virtual-reality community. Everyone is desperate to uncover the true identity of her pink-haired, blue-eyed alter ego – and when Belle meets the mysterious, monstrous Beast online, she is desperate to work out who he is, too. (Nicholas Barber) Released on 14 January in the US and Turkey, 20 Jan in Italy, and 4 February in the UK and Spain The Batman Robert Pattinson channels his inner bat in this latest, grammatically precise reboot. It's not Batman, it's The Batman. And if you thought The Dark Knight was a moody guy, think again. Matt Reeves, who co-wrote and directs, told Empire he sees his version of the crime-fighter as a recluse inspired by Kurt Cobain, right down to a grungy, well-worn Batsuit. Pattinson has the right brooding game for this, portraying a hero who is only in his second year of saving Gotham, still finding his way as he takes on the ruthless Riddler (Paul Dano). Colin Farrell, under layers of prosthetics, is The Penguin. But seemingly there will be some humour amid the darkness and violence, going by the comical moment in one of the trailers, when The Batman deadpans to Catwoman (Zoë Kravitz), in his husky, ultra-serious voice, ""You've got a lot of cats."" (CJ) Released internationally on 4 March Everything Everywhere All at Once The directing team known as Daniels (aka Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert) turned eccentricity into an art form in 2016's Swiss Army Man, their droll, blacker-than-black comedy about a flatulent corpse. Their new film, with a title suggesting controlled chaos, leaps into sci-fi. Michelle Yeoh plays a woman whose simple, relatable attempt to finish her taxes takes her across multiple universes, where she may exist as different versions of herself. The cast includes Jamie Lee Curtis as a villainous accountant who gets in her way. The trailer suggests an emotional family story, a martial arts extravaganza and a deserved showcase for Yeoh, all shaped by Daniels' maniacally off-the-chart style. (CJ) Released in the US and Canada on 25 March Turning Red Like Inside Out, Turning Red is a Pixar cartoon about the pains of growing up as a girl, but it is unique in lots of ways: this is Pixar's first film to be directed solely by a woman, the first to be set in Canada, and the first to revolve around a heroine from an Asian family. The heroine in question is Meilin – or Mei – (Rosalie Chiang), a hard-working student who transforms into a huge, shaggy red panda whenever she is stressed. Given that Mei is a 13-year-old Chinese-Canadian, and that the film is set in Toronto in the early-2000s, Turning Red appears to be drawn from the experiences of its writer-director, Domee Shi – except, presumably, for the bit about swelling up into a giant, furry animal. Anyway, Mei looks so sweet and fluffy in the trailer that anyone with small children should place their order for a cuddly red panda toy now. (NB) Released internationally on 11 March Nope At the moment, nothing has been revealed about Nope except that 1: It stars Daniel Kaluuya, Keke Palmer and Steven Yeun; 2: The poster depicts some kind of cloudy flying saucer hovering over a valley town; and 3: the same poster describes it as ""A New Terror from the Mind of Academy Award Winner Jordan Peele"". Still, that information is enough for Nope to be a thrilling prospect. Peele's first two films, Get Out and Us, also had brief titles which didn't give away their stories – and, in fact, the less you knew about the plots in advance, the more riveting they were. But both turned out to be hugely imaginative horror movies that blended hair-raising scares and provocative social commentary. Dare you miss Peele's third big-screen offering? The answer is: Nope. (NB) Released on 22 July The Northman Robert Eggers' small, eerie, psychologically dark stunners have marked him as one of today's most original filmmakers. Anya Taylor-Joy, in her first starring role, was transported to the 16th Century and took on the devil in The Witch (2015), and in The Lighthouse, Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe tangled with each other as isolated 19th-Century lighthouse keepers. The Northman, another period piece, takes Eggers to 10th-Century Viking Iceland, but expands his scope with an epic tale and a large top-rank cast that includes Dafoe, Taylor-Joy, Nicole Kidman, Björk and Ethan Hawke, with Alexander Skarsgård in the lead as a prince out to avenge his father's death. Eggers' vision promises to be as bold and bizarre as ever, with wide-scale action, intense close-ups and Kidman in yet another of her crazy-long wigs. (CJ) Released internationally on 22 April Killers of the Flower Moon The 26th film from Martin Scorsese is his first ever Western – although it does echo some of his previous masterpieces: once again, Scorsese has opted to tell a momentous true story of greed, ambition and brutal crime. Adapted by Eric Roth from the non-fiction book by David Grann, Killers of the Flower Moon examines the murders of several members of the Osage tribe in the 1920s. Robert De Niro plays William Hale, an Oklahoma cattle rancher who covets the oil rights of the Indigenous people, and Leonardo DiCaprio plays Hale's conflicted nephew, who is married to an Osage tribeswoman (Lily Gladstone). Yes, the main attraction here is that we're finally getting to see Scorsese's two favourite leading men together in one of his films. Mind you, Jesse Plemons is sure to match them as Tom White, the FBI agent assigned to the case. (NB) Released in 2022 The Woman King In a year full of powerful women on screen, the two in this 19th-Century historical drama may be the most intriguing. Viola Davis, who has made fierceness her trademark style, plays the leader of a women's military group in the African kingdom of Dahomey (a country now within present-day Benin) and Thuso Mbedu, the electrifying star of The Underground Railroad, is one of her recruits, as they fight threatening colonisers. Lashana Lynch, briefly 007 in No Time to Die, and John Boyega also star in the historical epic. Black Panther proved there's a hunger for African heroes, and director Gina Prince-Bythewood is experienced at both character portraits (the classic relationship film Love and Basketball) and action (the 2020 superhero movie The Old Guard with Charlize Theron). (CJ) Released in the US and Canada on 16 September Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (Part One) One of the most innovative of all superhero films, Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse pioneered its own pop-art visual style, and introduced the film world to the concept of different Spider-Men (Spider-Mans?) in alternate universes – a concept that has since been borrowed by Marvel's live-action Spider-Man: No Way Home. It's unlikely that the sequel will be quite as inventive, but, as the sub-title suggests, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (Part One) is the first episode in a two-part story, which makes it a rarity in the world of animated films. Once again masterminded by creators of The Lego Movie Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, the film unites such Spider-People as Miles Morales (Shameik Moore), Peter B Parker (Jake Johnson), Gwen Stacy (Hailee Steinfeld) and the Spider-Man of the year 2099 (Oscar Isaac). (NB) Released internationally on 7 October The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent Nicolas Cage gets the role of a life, actually, his lifetime, playing a fictional version of Nicolas Cage in this tongue-in-cheek action comedy. Fictional Nic accepts a $1 million payday to make a personal appearance at a fan's birthday party in Spain, a move that somehow comes to involve Tiffany Haddish as a CIA agent. Cage has always been savvy about his image and has a winning sense of humour about his career, which veers between respected performances, as in last year's drama Pig, and... let's just say a lot of over-the-top stuff. The Unbearable Weight promises to make references to plenty of his movies, so there is one safe bet: no film this year will be more meta. (CJ) Released internationally on 22 April The Worst Person in the World If you're lucky, you can get through your 20s with none of the restrictions you had as a child, and none of the responsibilities which come later. But what should you do with all that freedom? It's a question that puzzles Julie (Renate Reinsve) in Joachim Trier's bittersweet romantic comedy drama, The Worst Person in the World. Divided into 12 chapters, this generational character study follows Julie through her early adulthood in Oslo as she tries to decide which job and which man are right for her. According to viewers who have seen it at festivals and preview screenings, The Worst Person in the World is one of the Best Films in the World. It currently has a score of 100% on Rotten Tomatoes, Barack Obama included it on his list of favourite movies of 2021, and the luminous Reinsve won the best actress prize at Cannes. (NB) Released in the US on 4 February 2022 Don't Worry Darling This psychological thriller has been garnering tabloid and internet headlines for months, thanks to the relationship between director Oliva Wilde, and one of its stars, popstar Harry Styles. What's on screen is likely to be much more fascinating, though. The ever-surprising Florence Pugh – of Little Women, Midsommar and Black Widow – transforms herself yet again, into a 1950s housewife in a utopian community who begins to suspect that her world and her husband (Styles) are concealing dark secrets. Wilde, who sharply directed the very different coming-of-age comedy Booksmart, has told Vogue that films like Fatal Attraction and Indecent Proposal were among her inspirations here because they ""are really sexy, in a grown-up way"". That would certainly set her film apart in a world of superheroes. (CJ) Released internationally in on 23 September She Said  Journalists are the heroines here, with Carey Mulligan and Zoe Kazan playing the New York Times investigative reporters who unearthed the news about Harvey Weinstein, the one-time movie mogul now serving time in prison for rape and sexual assault. The woman behind the camera is as impressive as the stars, if less famous: Maria Schrader, recognisable as an actress (Deutschland 83) is also the Emmy-winning director of the Netflix series Unorthodox and the director of the Oscar-shortlisted comedy I'm Your Man. She should bring a sharp-eyed style and astute social awareness to the story that helped launch #MeToo. (CJ) Released in the US on 18 November Babylon Damien Chazelle's love of Hollywood's golden age shone through his Oscar-nominated musical comedy, La La Land. Now the writer-director is sharing that love again in Babylon, a glamorous period drama that takes place in the roaring 20s. Specifically, the film is set at the end of the silent era, much like Singin' In The Rain and The Artist, and it mixes fictional characters with historical figures, much like Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. It also shares two of its stars with Once Upon a Time in Hollywood: Brad Pitt plays a fictional director who has trouble adjusting to the new sound technology, and Margot Robbie plays Clara Bow, the real-life so-called ""It Girl"" who was a colossal box-office draw in both the silents and the talkies. (NB) Released on 25 December Top Gun: Maverick OK, so this belated Top Gun sequel was on our list of films to watch in 2021, and before that it was scheduled to come out in 2020, but we're still optimistic that lovers of supersonic aerobatics will finally get what they've been waiting for this year, shortly before Tom Cruise's 60th birthday. It was back in 1986 that Cruise last played Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell, a trainee fighter pilot in the US Navy. Can anyone really believe that, all these years later, Maverick would only be a captain while his old frenemy ""Iceman"" (Val Kilmer) would be a four-star general? Maybe not, but it should be fun to see Cruise in his Aviator shades and bomber jacket once again, alongside such new recruits to the series as Jennifer Connelly, Jon Hamm, Ed Harris and Miles Teller. Cruise fans take note: Mission: Impossible 7 is due in September, too. (NB) Released internationally on 27 May Avatar 2 There are two things we know about James Cameron: he can't be rushed, and he loves the ocean. Those qualities come together in Avatar 2, the first of a whopping four planned sequels to his 2009 spectacle, the highest-grossing movie of all time. The new film returns to the planet of Pandora, where blue-skinned Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) and her human husband Jake (Sam Worthington) are now parents, and Earthlings still haven't solved the climate crisis. Most of the action takes place underwater and was shot in a 900,000-gallon tank. The Avatar sequels have been in the works for a decade, but Cameron's water-logged hits, Titanic and The Abyss, also arrived behind schedule, and it all turned out just fine. (CJ) Released internationally (so they say) on 16 December Lightyear Buzz Lightyear has been central to four Toy Story feature films, his own TV series, and various animated shorts. This year, the square-jawed Space Ranger is getting a film of his own – sort of. The idea is that the Buzz Lightyear in Toy Story was a plastic action figure, whereas the new animation – a homage to the sci-fi films of the 1970s and 1980s – is the big-budget adventure movie which that action figure was based on. It's a slightly confusing concept, but it lets director Angus MacLane (co-director of Finding Dory) and screenwriter Pete Docter (Soul, Up, Inside Out) bring back a beloved character while giving his interstellar scrapes a new look, a more serious tone, and a fresh voice: Chris Evans rather than Tim Allen is the actor who'll be shouting, ""To infinity – and beyond!"" (NB) Released internationally on 17 June Elvis It's been almost a decade since the release of Baz Luhrmann's The Great Gatsby, but the Australian writer-director of Strictly Ballroom, Romeo + Juliet, and Moulin Rouge! is back at last. Never one to shy away from a big, risky project, Luhrmann has made an Elvis Presley biopic that chronicles 20 years in the life of The King of Rock ’n’ Roll. Austin Butler – an uncanny lookalike – has the title role, alongside Olivia DeJonge as Elvis's wife Priscilla and Tom Hanks as his manager, ""Colonel"" Tom Parker, the Dutch carnival worker who reinvented himself as an all-American impresario. Don't be surprised if Luhrmann indulges his addiction to loud music and splashy spectacle in the Las Vegas scenes – and don't be surprised if Hanks is nominated for an Oscar in 2023. (NB) Released on 24 June Blonde It's Ana de Armas's turn to put on the platinum wig as Marilyn Monroe, whose allure for novelists and filmmakers seems inexhaustible. Blonde is based on Joyce Carol Oates' 2000 novel that takes us inside the mind of Monroe, now known to the world as the neediest, sexiest and most tragically-exploited movie star of the 1950s and '60s. Writer-director Andrew Dominick, who made the underrated Brad Pitt Western The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, follows Oates' lead in coyly nicknaming Marilyn's husbands. Adrien Brody's character, Arthur Miller, is called only The Playwright. Bobby Cannavale, the Joe DiMaggio figure, is The Ex-Athlete. IMDb also lists a character called President's Pimp, so there may be room for surprises even in this often-told story. (CJ) Released in 2022   Black Panther: Wakanda Forever Chadwick Boseman wasn't just the star of Black Panther, he was an inspirational figure who revolutionised Hollywood's representation of African and African-American characters. Shortly after he died of cancer in August 2020, Marvel's boss, Kevin Feige, announced that no one else could play T'Challa, aka Black Panther, and so the character wouldn't be recast for further films. This left Ryan Coogler, the director and co-writer, with a fearsomely difficult task: how to make a satisfying Black Panther sequel without the franchise's lead actor and lead character. All we know for certain is that nearly all of the previous film's cast and crew will return, including Lupita Nyong'o as T'Challa's ex-girlfriend and Letitia Wright as his sister Shuri. In the comics, Shuri took on the mantle of the Black Panther while her brother was in a coma, so could something similar happen in the film? (NB) Released on 11 November   Knives Out 2 Same private detective: Daniel Craig as Benoit Blanc, the sleuth with the cartoonishly over-the-top accent from some indeterminate part of the American South. Different murder mystery: this time set in Greece, with a new cast including Edward Norton, Janelle Monáe and Dave Bautista. Same writer and director: Rian Johnson, but much richer. Netflix made a deal reportedly for $469 million (including production budget) for two sequels to Johnson's 2019 hit that evoked the classic board game Cluedo (or Clue, if you're in North America). Whodunnits come and go, but Craig's Blanc is an original, witty confection of a character, an engaging parody that still allows you to be invested in his crime-fighting.

Hawkish,Nine TV shows to watch this January,2024-09-25,2022-01-05,Amy Charles,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20220104-nine-tv-shows-to-watch-this-january,"From the glitzy The Gilded Age to a James Gunn prequel series to The Suicide Squad and a darkly comic psychological thriller, Amy Charles picks the series not to miss this January. The Gilded Age Creator of Downton Abbey Julian Fellowes has turned his attention to late-19th Century New York for another period drama examining the complex minutiae of high society, and the potential pitfalls it faces as the world changes. The Gilded Age begins with Marian Brook (played by daughter of Meryl Streep, Louisa Jacobson), moving to New York City from Pennsylvania, to live with her aunts (played by Cynthia Nixon and Christine Baranski). This pair are as old money as it comes, and become embroiled in a social war with their neighbours the Russells (Morgan Spector and Carrie Coon), a nouveau riche couple who made money through the railways. The cast is stacked with Broadway stars including Denée Benton, Nathan Lane and Audra McDonald, and from the trailer this show looks to be just as soapy, escapist and glamorous as Downton, but this time with not one, but two wise-cracking old-school matriarchs. The Gilded Age premieres on 24 January on HBO and HBO Max in the US, and on 25 January on Sky Atlantic and Now TV in the UK. Archive 81 Loosely based on the horror podcast of the same name, Archive 81 is a supernatural thriller with convergent timelines. Archivist Dan Turner (Mamoudou Athie, The Circle), who has a tragic past, is restoring damaged videotapes, which feature an investigation into a cult that was filmed in the mid-90s at the behest of a secretive businessman. The filmmaker Melody Pendras (Dina Shihabi, Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan) came to a grisly end 25 years ago, and in the process of working on the tapes, Dan comes to believe he can save her. Matt McGorry (Orange is the New Black) and Martin Donovan (Tenet, Big Little Lies) co-star. Archive 81 is released on 14 January on Netflix. Peacemaker Written and directed by The Suicide Squad director James Gunn, this new HBO series zones in on one of the members of the supervillain crew, played by John Cena, and tells his origin story. As his name suggests, Peacemaker is obsessed with keeping the peace, no matter how many people are hurt in order to achieve it. The trailer suggests that viewers should expect to see a lot more of Gunn's trademark irreverence, as well as the high-octane, violent action sequences seen in The Suicide Squad. However in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Gunn said that while ""there are a lot of similarities to The Suicide Squad … there are also a lot of things that are very different, in that it's quieter in some ways… it's even more grounded, more natural and more real. But it's still within a big science-fiction storyline."" The rest of the cast includes Danielle Brooks (Orange is the New Black), Freddie Stroma (Bridgerton), and Robert Patrick, best remembered as Terminator 2's shape-shifting bad guy, who plays Auggie, Peacemaker's plain-speaking and never-satisfied father. Peacemaker premieres on 13 January on HBO Max in the US. The Afterparty In this new comedy-thriller, a high-school reunion goes very, very wrong when, amongst the frivolity and excess of reuniting with old friends and foes, a murder is committed. The host, almost universally disliked popstar Xavier (Dave Franco) is found dead, and Detective Danner (Tiffany Haddish) is tasked with uncovering who killed him; making it more high-concept is the fact that each episode will show the night from the perspective of a different partygoer while using a different film genre that matches the particular characters' personality. The cast is packed with great comic actors including Sam Richardson, Zoë Chao, Ben Schwartz, Ike Barinholtz, Ilana Glazer and Jamie Demetriou. In a statement when the teaser trailer was released, co-creators Chris Miller and Phil Lord (The Lego Movie, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse) said ""This is one of the most surprising, original and fun projects we've ever made… Our goal was to tell a comedic whodunnit story in a new and exciting way."" Watch the trailer here. The Afterparty premiers on 28 January on Apple TV+. Around the World in 80 Days Warm up the wintry evenings with this joyous adaptation of Jules Verne's classic novel, which travels the globe in magnificent period fashion. Starring David Tennant (Doctor Who) as Phileas Fogg, this family-friendly adventure feels perfect for now. Set in 1872, it begins with the eccentric Fogg making a £20,000 (the equivalent of over a million pounds today) bet that he can circumnavigate the globe in the titular time limit. Tagging along is French valet Passepartout (Ibrahim Koma), and young journalist Abigail 'Fix' Fortescue (Leonie Benesch) who is documenting his progress for a British newspaper. Created by Life on Mars' Ashley Pharoah and with a score co-written by Hans Zimmer, it is ""big television"" that ""zips around the planet"", as the Guardian put it – and with a second series already confirmed, it's certainly worth hopping on and enjoying the ride.

As We See It ""I've spent my entire life trying to hide the autism thing,"" Jack, (Rick Glassman, Undateable), tells his helper Mandy in the trailer for new series As We See It. ""I think you are such a beautiful person that you shouldn't have to hide who you are,"" Mandy (Sosie Bacon, Mare of Easttown) replies. ""That makes me want to throw up,"" retorts Jack. It's an exchange that seems to give some idea about the irreverent approach to neurodiversity of this coming-of-age comedy drama following three twenty-somethings, all of whom are on the autistic spectrum, as they navigate work, friendships and love in the modern world. Centring on Jack, Harrison (Albert Rutecki) and Violet (Sue Ann Pien), each played by actors who identify as living on the autistic spectrum, it's based on the award-winning Israeli series On the Spectrum, and could help to redress the tired tropes used to depict in the autistic community in previous films and TV series. As We See It is released on 21 January on Prime Video. The Journalist As Netflix continues to invest more and more in content from all corners of the globe, this new Japanese series, which tackles globally relevant issues of political corruption, could be the latest non-English language show to hit big on the platform. Based on the award-winning 2019 film of the same name, and created by its writer-director Michihito Fujii, it stars Ryoko Yonekura (Doctor X) as Anna, the titular reporter searching for the truth as she embarks on a major investigation that could implicate people in the highest echelons of power. The Journalist is released on 13 January on Netflix. The Woman in the House Across the Street from the Girl in the Window Over the last few years, the books market became flooded with murder mysteries with unreliable female narrators. Then came the film and TV adaptations of the same novels; you know the ones: The Girl on the Train, Gone Girl, Woman in the Window, the list goes on. Now, The Woman in the House Across the Street from the Girl in the Window puts a darkly parodic spin on this sub-genre, with The Good Place's Kristen Bell taking on the leading role as Anna, who heartbroken and living alone, and with a habit of drinking very, very large glasses of wine, witnesses a murder – or so she thinks. The result is a psychological thriller with laughs: speaking to Entertainment Weekly, Bell said of reading the script for the first time ""It was like nothing I'd ever heard before, and it made me laugh… It was so outside the box and absurd that I knew I had to be involved."" Watch the trailer here. The Woman in the House Across the Street from the Girl in the Window is released on 28 January on Netflix. The Tourist Fifty Shades of Grey star Jamie Dornan is the charismatic lynchpin of this gripping six-parter set in the Australian outback. As it begins, his character, simply known as The Man, is driving across the desert and realises he's being pursued by an enormous truck. After being driven off the road, he then wakes up in hospital, with absolutely no idea who he is. Helen, a police officer played by Danielle Macdonald (Patti Cake$), is determined to help him rediscover his identity, but as The Man and his companions search for the truth, others search for him. Written and executive produced by TV thriller maestros Jack and Harry Williams (The Missing, Baptiste, Liar), it has received acclaim from critics including The Guardian's Lucy Mangan who wrote that ""it's well worth watching this fun, stylish and confident caper, which clearly still has numerous twists up its sleeve and characters to play with.""

Hawkish,The ultimate 21st-Century whodunnits,2024-09-25,2022-02-01,Clare Thorp,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20220131-the-afterparty-the-reinvention-of-the-murder-mystery,"The Afterparty is the latest show to reimagine the whodunnit for a new generation of armchair detectives, writes Clare Thorp. A party in a lavish setting. A group of wildly different personalities. And then… a dead body, a room full of suspects, countless motives – and an inimitable detective determined to get answers. On the surface, new murder-mystery series The Afterparty feels reassuringly familiar. But – in true whodunnit fashion – nothing is entirely as it seems in Apple TV+'s new show, which is both a classic murder mystery, a riotous comedy – and something entirely new. More like this:  - The 100 greatest TV series of the 21st Century  - Television's reckoning with the past  - The dark side of 21st-Century comedy The show centres around a 15-year high-school reunion that ends with a VIP afterparty in a cliffside mansion – and a body at the bottom of the rocks. The cast includes Tiffany Haddish as the detective, Dave Franco as the victim (no spoilers – his death kicks off the whole show), and a gaggle of former classmates – and suspects – played by an impressive collection of comic talent, including Ben Schwartz (Parks and Recreation), Ilana Glazer (Broad City), Sam Richardson (Veep) and Jamie Demetriou (Stath Lets Flats). In a bold move by creators Phil Lord and Chris Miller – the team behind The Lego Movie and Spider-Man: Into the Spider-verse – each suspect gets not just their own episode, but their own genre too. Depending on whose version of events we are seeing, the story is told as a rom-com, a musical, a psychological thriller, an action movie, a high-school movie, a gritty cop show and even an animation, with the camera techniques, lighting, music and direction to match. ""For my whole life, I have loved watching Columbo and Murder She Wrote, reading all the Agatha Christie books, and doing crossword puzzles, acrostics, and hidden-word things,"" says Chris Miller in the show's production notes. ""So to be able to do a comedy version of a whodunnit has been a real dream come true."" The show is inventive, chaotic and a lot of fun. It's also the latest in a new wave of murder mysteries on the big and small screen that are reinventing the genre for a new generation of armchair detectives. The Afterparty comes on the heels of last year's Only Murders in The Building, a ten-part whodunnit that paired comic stalwarts Steve Martin and Martin Short with Selena Gomez as three true-crime podcast fans who team up to solve a murder in their apartment block – and launch their own podcast about it. The show was a critical hit (scoring a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes), became Hulu's most-watched comedy ever in the US, and has a second season on the way. This month, Murderville – based on the BBC show Murder in Successville – comes to Netflix. It sees Will Arnett play a detective joined by a succession of celebrity guests (including Annie Murphy, Sharon Stone, Conan O'Brien and Kumail Nanjiani) to solve murders – the twist being the star guests have no script and have to improvise. There are more in the works, too. The next show from The OA creators Brit Marling and Zal Batmanglij will be a ""radical conceptualisation of the classic whodunnit"", set at a billionaire's remote retreat and starring Emma Corrin (The Crown) as an amateur sleuth. On the big screen, a glossy new adaptation of Agatha Christie's Death on the Nile – its release delayed after controversy surrounding one of its stars, Armie Hammer – is released this month. And later this year there will be a sequel to Knives Out – the film that, arguably, led the way for this new wave of murder mysteries. Released in 2019, Rian Johnson's take on a classic whodunnit gathered an impressively starry ensemble cast – including Daniel Craig as detective Benoit Blanc, alongside Jamie Lee Curtis, Chris Evans, Ana de Armas, Christopher Plummer, Toni Colette, Don Johnson and Lakeith Stanfield. Critics loved it – but it was at the box office that Knives Out made the most impact, taking more than $300million, and becoming the second most successful original film (neither an adaptation nor a sequel) that year. In a movie industry that leans heavily on franchises and reboots for its big-hitters, Knives Out showed that fresh stories – albeit ones inspired by old favourites – could still be a huge success. So much so that Netflix paid $469million for the rights to two sequels, each of which will see Daniel Craig's Benoit Blanc return to investigate a new crime, with a brand new ensemble cast each time. The name is now Blanc, Detective Blanc. Knives Out came two years after Kenneth Branagh's adaptation of Agatha Christie's Murder on the Orient Express, also a huge box-office hit, proved that whodunnits – especially star-studded ones – were still a draw. But Johnson didn't just jump on the murder mystery bandwagon. He'd had the idea for Knives Out nearly a decade earlier and, while a huge fan of the genre, he wanted to do more than just pay homage to it. ""When you see a whodunnit, you tend to see it as a period piece, because it's usually an Agatha Christie adaptation,"" he told The Atlantic. ""So the idea of doing an original one and setting it in the America of 2019 – not just giving it a modern skin but really plugging into today – there was something about that that seemed genuinely exciting."" For writers and directors, a modern murder mystery is an alluring prospect. ""Over the last decade there have been crime-fiction writers who have said the whodunnit is dead, and the reason they think that is because we've run out of clever plots,"" says Dr Benedict Morrison, lecturer in literature, film and television at the University of Exeter. ""There's no other way to get out of a locked room that hasn't already been done. There's no way of breaking an alibi that hasn't already been done. So I think it is really an exciting challenge that a creator takes on – not only to be sufficiently crafty to get one over on the viewer or the reader, but also to find something that actually feels fresh."" Morrison thinks the latest breed of whodunnits, for all their modern twists, stay surprisingly faithful to the spirit of the classic murder mystery in both their wit and their subtle examination of social issues. ""We might encounter Christie now, and think her work is dated, but at the time she was reflecting on very contemporary concerns,"" he says. ""Only Murders in the Building is engaged with contemporary technology and this kind of strange fetishisation of crime that occurs through podcasts. It's exploring that, but not in a heavy-handed way."" It also features one of last year's most creative moments of television – a dialogue-free episode that centres around a deaf character. In Knives Out, there are plenty of laughs and a compelling puzzle to solve – but Johnson also addresses inherited wealth, white privilege, the treatment of immigrants and liberal hypocrisy, creating a sharp social satire. ""The way in which we see how class still operates in contemporary society – that's exactly the kind of social politics which has always been explored in the genre,"" says Morrison. What makes the whodunnit so suited for examining these issues? ""The simplest answer is that at the heart of it is a puzzle about a violent crime, so to some extent questions of guilt, of shame, of culpability, of exploitation, of violence… these things are already baked into the form."" Morrison says the very nature of a murder mystery – which encourages the audience to engage their brain to solve the puzzle – helps, too. ""Our principal engagement with it is intended to be intellectual rather than emotional – it encourages us to think through things and to try to get to the bottom of what people's real relationships are with each other."" Tricks of the mind Working those brain cells is one of the purest pleasures of watching a murder mystery, as us viewers find ourselves in competition with the detective to decipher the clues and identify the killer. For The Afterparty, Miller and Lord worked with magician and puzzle creator David Kwong and puzzle master Dave Shukan to make their mystery as fun as possible for fans. ""In every episode, we've hidden a bunch of coded messages that are extra bonus hints for who did it,"" says Miller. ""In the set dressing there are all these hidden things and if you freeze-frame you can decode hidden messages."" Originally written as a 90-minute film, Miller expanded his idea into a series to sustain the story over a longer period. Episodic television offers something films cannot – the chance for fans to share their theories – in person, on social media or on Reddit – as the show progresses, building excitement and anticipation. Like Only Murders in The Building, The Afterparty will – after an initial three-episode drop – release new episodes weekly. ""Taking advantage of this serial form for the murder mystery is really smart and hasn't been done that often in the past,"" says Morrison. Another delight of the whodunnit is watching the combined charisma of a starry ensemble cast, who each get their chance to shine. Actors often play against type – a cinematic sweetheart becomes an evil villainess, superheroes become murder suspects. Clever casting plays with our expectations of characters (Marvel's crime-fighting Captain America, aka Chris Evans, couldn't really be the conniving killer in Knives Out… could he?). In Only Murders in The Building – nominated for a SAG award for Best Comedy Ensemble – the generational divide between Steve Martin and Martin Short, and Selena Gomez, provided plenty of funny moments – but also a surprising and charming friendship that was the backbone of the show. Gomez's performance was a revelation – and it couldn't hurt that she has nearly 300 million followers on Instagram, helping the show draw in a younger audience. ""There's a line in Murder on the Orient Express [the book] where Poirot is talking about how on a train you get this extraordinary collection of different kinds of characters, the old and the young, the rich and the poor and so on,"" says Morrison. ""Whodunnits are very good at finding ways to show these interactions between very different types of personality but also very different types of kind of social position. It's why they're so good at talking about things like class and gender and sexuality."" It helps that the actors seem to be having as much fun playing these parts as we are watching them. In Knives Out, Daniel Craig sports an exaggerated southern drawl, sings along to Stephen Sondheim and is clearly loving every moment. Tiffany Haddish recalls in The Afterparty's production notes that when her agent said Lord and Miller wanted her to star in the show: ""They said it's a mystery show where you solve cases, a whodunnit like Clue, and I was like, that's my game. Let's go!"" Tiffany Little Canfield, casting director of Only Murders in The Building, says the genre is inherently attractive to actors. ""A murder mystery implies that you have several suspects, and when you are a suspect, the writers want to lead the audience on that you could be the killer,"" she tells BBC Culture. ""So those parts always have mystery. They always have a secret. The actors know that even if they aren't the killer, they're probably still going to have some meaty writing. Even the little tiny parts, they've got something really delicious about them. It's a casting director's dream to work on something like that."" It means even a supporting role in a murder mystery is catnip – and Canfield has fielded calls from agents keen to make it known that their clients are fans of the show and would relish a guest role. The time commitment is low but the pay-off is huge, says Canfield. ""You get to show up for a couple of days or an episode and have a great part."" The first season of Only Murders in the Building had memorable cameos from Sting and Tina Fey – and Shirley Maclaine and Amy Schumer are lined up for the next series (with Cara Delevingne joining as a recurring character). The new breed of murder mysteries gives us irresistible all-star casts, sharp humour and an opportunity to divert ourselves with communal puzzle-solving. At a time when many of us would like to escape reality, it makes sense that there's a demand for them. ""The moments when murder mysteries have really done huge business, both in terms of literature and cinema, have tended to coincide with moments of quite considerable social and political strain,"" says Morrison. He thinks there is something more at play, though. ""I've never entirely been sold on the murder mysteries-as-escapism idea. Instead, I think this is a safe and managed way to think about some of the questions that are facing society."" He points out that the murder mystery in its classic form first flourished after World War One, with Christie's first published novel, The Mysterious Affair at Styles, published in 1920. ""We also saw a massive rise in the number of film whodunnits in the post-World War Two period."" In some ways, it seems counterintuitive that a society coming to terms with loss on such a scale should invest in a genre all about death. ""But actually, murder mysteries are about finding a certain kind of meaning within it,"" says Morrison. ""I personally don't think that order is totally restored at the end of a murder mystery. There's always a kind of residual anxiety. But nevertheless, we feel in some way we've understood the meaning of this particular death."" In uncertain times, it's comforting to have some answers. Not to mention the delicious satisfaction that comes if we manage to crack the code and beat the detective to it. Love film and TV?

Hawkish,Macron flexes political muscle in boxing photos,2024-09-25,2024-03-20,By Andre Rhoden-Paul,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68618722,"First he flexed his muscles on Ukraine. Now Emmanuel Macron has gone one further, releasing photos of him hitting a punchbag with bulging biceps in a show of his strength in action. The French president's photographer posted two images on Instagram, days after he began to take a far more hawkish public line against Russia. It was not long before ""Rocky"" began to trend on social media. Perhaps inevitably, others questioned whether the photos had been ""enhanced"".  Doubters pointed to the size of his biceps, and re-posted the boxing picture alongside an image of Mr Macron, 46, with a skinnier arm.   Others joked and tweeted the pictures, taken by Soazing de la Moissonnière, saying that they showed Mr Macron, a keen boxer, getting ready to take on Russia and its 71-year-old president, Vladimir Putin.  They were published less than a week after the French president suggested sending Western troops to Ukraine could not be ruled out.  Speaking on French TV last Thursday, he warned that Russia was seeking to extend its power and would not stop now. ""If we leave Ukraine alone, if we let Ukraine lose this war, then for sure Russia will threaten Moldova, Romania and Poland,"" he said. The imagery will not be lost on his adversary in the Kremlin, who has been repeatedly photographed bare-chested to show his own personal fitness. Gaspard Gantzer, a well-known public relations expert, told newspaper Nice-Matin that the president wanted the images to show ""he is a Frenchman like any other ... that he is in great physical shape ... that he wants to fight."" Broadcaster CNews said of the pictures: ""In the two photos, we see the head of state ready to fight, his gaze fixed on the punching bag. ""As if he was determined to beat his opponents. The drawn features, the bulging muscles, the clenched teeth, the president looks like a true warrior."" French weekly women's magazine Femme Actuelle painted a more flattering view, saying the photos ""hit hard"" and also pointed to bulging biceps. However, the photos did not go down well with all in France.  Sandrine Rousseau, an opposition Greens MP, reposted the photo on Twitter with the comment: ""What misery of politics!"" ""The pose seems advantageous,"" the French daily newspaper Le Figaro said, but added that the photos had ""aroused much mockery"". Mr Macron is among a long list of politicians who have been keen to show off their sporting prowess.  President Putin famously paraded bare-chested on a horse and is no stranger to an ice hockey match or releasing a judo DVD.  Mr Macron previously made headlines with a very relaxed photo of him in an unbuttoned shirt and chest hair on full display.   His wife, Brigitte Macron, said in November that the president did boxing training twice a week."
Hawkish,Israel defence minister resigns over Gaza,2024-09-25,2018-11-14,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-46207094,"Israel's defence minister has resigned over the cabinet's decision to accept a ceasefire ending two days of fighting with Palestinian militants in Gaza. Avigdor Lieberman denounced the move as ""surrendering to terror"". He said his right-wing Yisrael Beiteinu party would leave the ruling coalition, which could lead to an early election. Eight people were killed on Monday and Tuesday as militants fired 460 rockets towards Israel and Israeli forces bombed 160 targets in Gaza. The ceasefire was largely holding on Wednesday and schools and businesses in southern Israel reopened after no rocket attacks were reported overnight. However, Israel's military said it had shot at and captured a Palestinian man who tried to breach the Israel-Gaza border fence while hurling grenades. Palestinian health officials later said a fisherman had been killed by Israeli fire in northern Gaza. The Israeli military said soldiers had shot the man because he was advancing towards the border fence.  The fighting - the most intense since the 50-day war in 2014 - began after an Israeli special forces undercover operation in Gaza was exposed on Sunday, triggering clashes that left seven Palestinian militants and one Israeli soldier dead.  Late on Monday, militants launched a barrage of rockets and mortars at Israel. One of the rockets hit a block of flats in the town of Ashkelon, killing a Palestinian man who was working in Israel. In response, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) carried out what it called a wide-scale attack against targets belonging to the militant groups Hamas, which dominates Gaza, and Islamic Jihad. The Hamas-run Gaza health ministry said seven people were killed in the strikes. Five of the dead were said to be militants and the other two farmers.  Hamas and other Palestinian factions announced on Tuesday afternoon that they had accepted an Egyptian-mediated ceasefire and would abide by it if Israel did. Israel's security cabinet initially said only that it was ordering the military to continue its operations as required, but Mr Lieberman and another minister appeared to confirm it had agreed to accept a ceasefire when they denied supporting it. At a news conference in Jerusalem on Wednesday, the defence minister said the military response to the rocket fire had been ""insufficient and inappropriate"". He added that the government was making a serious mistake by accepting a ceasefire with Hamas and other militant groups that Israel, the US, EU and UK have designated as terrorist organisations. ""We are buying quiet for the short term at the price of serious damage to national security in the long term"" he warned. Mr Lieberman revealed he had similarly opposed recent decisions to allow into Gaza fuel for the territory's power plant and $15m (£12m) in cash from Qatar intended to fund the salaries of unpaid civil servants in the Hamas-run government. ""I could not remain [in office] and still be able to look residents of the south in the eyes,"" he added. Dozens of residents of Israeli border communities protested after the ceasefire announcement at what they called the ""lack of action by the Israeli government"" to deal with the threat of Palestinian rocket attacks. Mr Lieberman also announced that Yisrael Beiteinu would leave the ruling coalition and called on other parties to agree on an early date for a general election, which is not due until November 2019. By Yolande Knell, BBC News, Jerusalem This announcement by Mr Lieberman was expected.   He has been calling for tough Israeli military action against Hamas and has opposed ongoing efforts by Egypt and the UN to secure a long-term ceasefire deal that would quieten the Israel-Gaza border. His hawkish stance as defence minister has often left him at odds with the military top brass. But it plays out well with the voter base of his political party. The decision to withdraw Yisrael Beiteinu from the coalition government weakens Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who now controls just 61 of 120 parliamentary seats.   However, an official close to Mr Netanyahu told the BBC it was ""not necessary to go to elections in this sensitive security period"". He added that the prime minister would now take over the defence ministry. Mr Netanyahu's office said he was holding consultations with ministers from his right-wing Likud party and other party leaders in effort to stabilise his coalition.  Earlier, the prime minister defended the ceasefire decision, saying that ""in times of emergency, when making decisions crucial to security, the public can't always be privy to the considerations that must be hidden from the enemy"". ""Our enemies begged for a ceasefire and they knew very well why,"" he added. Opposition leader Tzipi Livni of the centre-left Zionist Union alliance demanded an early general election. ""The government of failure in security must go,"" she said. ""No peace, no security - elections now that will lead to an emergency coalition headed by the Zionist Union. We will restore security and act for peace."" Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri said Mr Lieberman's resignation was ""recognition of the defeat before the growing force of Palestinian resistance"". "
Hawkish,Minor injuries unit to reopen in Dawlish,2024-09-25,2024-03-16,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-68536459,"A minor injuries unit (MIU) at a hospital in Devon is set to reopen in April, says the NHS. The MIU will reopen at Dawlish Community Hospital, operating Monday to Friday between 08:00 and 17:00. The unit will provide an appointment-priority service, allowing people to book appointments for the same day. Health bosses closed the unit in response to the Covid-19 pandemic due to staffing levels and service demands. Liz Davenport, chief executive at Torbay and South Devon NHS Foundation Trust, said: ""It has always been our plan to reopen the service as soon as we were confident we could provide a sustainable service.  ""Our teams have worked hard over a long period of time to reach this point.  ""We know how much the service means to local people and we would like to apologise once again for the long temporary closure."" The NHS said walk-in visitors would also be supported, but appointments would be prioritised - ""so people may be redirected"". It said the unit would reopen without X-ray facilities due to ""radiology workforce constraints"". Ms Davenport said the trust had followed the model at Totnes Community Hospital's MIU. ""The feedback on the 'appointment-priority' service at the MIU at Totnes Community Hospital has been very positive and has allowed us to deliver a consistent service in that area.  ""We are looking forward to bringing this service format to Dawlish Community Hospital and providing an MIU once again,"" she added. Follow BBC Devon on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

Hawkish,Councillors back new £15m cycle route bid,2024-09-25,2022-05-25,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-61579709,"Councillors have backed a £15m bid for a cycle route between Newton Abbot and Torquay. Teignbridge District Council and Devon County Council are applying to the government for ""levelling-up"" funding.  As well as the dedicated new cycle route, the scheme would help provide better connectivity to a new housing development at Wolborough. The government is expected to make a decision by the autumn, Teignbridge councillors were told. The local authority will put in £500,000 and Devon County Council has agreed to pay £1m, said the Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS). Speaking at this week's annual meeting, Councillor Gary Taylor, executive member for planning, said the route would make ""better use of existing infrastructure and encourage increased cycling along one of Teignbridge's most important commuter corridors"". He added: ""The scheme, with its new links, would deliver more sustainable, low carbon and low-cost travel choices and would secure long-lasting benefits for people living and working in the area."" Some councillors questioned why the authority was not instead focussing on the long-awaited next section of the Teign Estuary Trail, from the Passage House Inn to Teignmouth, that was approved by the county council last year. An officer explained that projects awarded levelling-up funding have to be completed by March 2025 and the county council had advised that it was ""not feasible"" to get the Teign Estuary Trail done within that timescale. The officer added, however, that the trail was a ""popular scheme and a high priority"". Follow BBC News South West on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. Send your story ideas to spotlight@bbc.co.uk."

Hawkish,Crushed Palestinian hopes 30 years after Oslo accords,2024-09-25,2023-09-12,By Yolande Knell,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-66751704,"It is the 30th anniversary of the breakthrough Oslo Accords between Israel and the Palestinians. The peace deal led to the creation of the Palestinian Authority, intended to provide interim self-government for just five years while negotiations solved outstanding core issues in the conflict. Today, nearly a decade after peace talks collapsed, the PA remains in place, but is losing its legitimacy.   With its vibrant restaurants, bustling malls and new construction constantly under way, affluent Ramallah has become synonymous with the Palestinian Authority (PA). Since 1993 when the first of a pair of agreements known as the Oslo Accords were signed on the White House lawn, foreign donor money has flowed into this West Bank city, north of Jerusalem. Its streets contain smart government ministries with signs and stationery locating them in the State of Palestine. But Palestinians are acutely aware that this is a facade. As far as Palestinians were concerned, the PA was supposed to be replaced with an elected government, running their own independent state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, with its capital in East Jerusalem. That dream has become ever more distant. ""Things are bad and going backwards,"" Um Nabil, a middle-aged shopper in Ramallah's Manara Square tells me. ""Our lives now are full of instability."" While opinion polls indicated the Oslo Accords were originally supported by two-thirds of the Palestinian public, the huge optimism it generated has been replaced by deep gloom.   ""It's just an overwhelming perception that the Palestinian leadership made a huge mistake some 30 years ago,"" says veteran Palestinian pollster, Khalil Shikaki. ""The belief that the two-state solution is no longer viable is also overwhelming, and that is making people a lot more depressed.""  The reality of life for Palestinians is a grinding military occupation. Whichever way they drive out of Ramallah, they encounter Israeli checkpoints, soldiers, and settlements.   At the time the Oslo Accord was signed in 1993, there were just over 110,000 Jewish settlers living in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. Today, the figure is more than 700,000. Settlements are seen as illegal under international law but Israel has always disputed that. Now the country has its most hardline ever government - with religious nationalist ministers who advocate annexation of the West Bank.   Meanwhile, the PA - dominated by the Palestinian President's Fatah faction - is weak and lacks initiatives to force Israel to stop expanding on land wanted for a future Palestinian state. It is corrupt and authoritarian and often seen as a tool of Israel's occupation.   There is huge resentment at how PA security forces co-ordinate with the Israeli army to arrest Palestinians allegedly planning attacks against Israelis. Members of the public also note that senior PA officials enjoy large salaries and VIP-style travel permits which ease Israeli restrictions on movement for them and their families. They believe that they use their status to help their allies gain access to such permits, as well as coveted public positions and contracts. Some 60% of the Palestinian public now see the Authority as a burden, according to Dr Shikaki's surveys. Six months ago, a slim majority even said that its collapse would serve their national interest. After Israel captured the West Bank and Gaza from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East War, its military governors ruled the territories directly. Meanwhile, East Jerusalem was annexed to Israel in a move that was not internationally recognised.  As a result of the Oslo Accords, leaders of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) - newly recognised by Israel as the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people - returned from exile abroad. The PLO had renounced terrorism and recognised Israel's right to exist in peace. With Yasser Arafat as president, the newly created PA began to take over basic services such as health, education and policing in Gaza and parts of the West Bank. Some 60% of the West Bank remained under full Israeli control but Palestinians hoped to expand their hold over time. It only took a few years for progress to come grinding to a halt.  The collapse of peace talks at Camp David in 2000 was followed by Palestinian fury when Israel's opposition leader visited Jerusalem's most sensitive holy site - the al-Aqsa Mosque compound, known to Jews as Temple Mount - seeking to promote Israeli sovereignty there.  The deadly violence of the second Palestinian intifada, or uprising, then left the peace process in tatters and strengthened the hawkish Israeli right-wing. Although negotiations were later brokered by the US, they achieved little; the last round fell apart in 2014. In his comfortable office in Ramallah, I meet Sabri Saidam, a former PA education minister who is now deputy secretary general of the Fatah Central Committee. He rejects the idea that the Authority is ineffective, describing its creation as ""a milestone."" His message is that propping it up preserves the possibility of the two-state solution - the international formula for peace. ""It is not the finale, yet it reflects an achievement the Palestinians would like to preserve,"" he says, spelling out how the PA has helped consolidate a Palestinian identity, established institutions, reinforced law and order and taken on tens of thousands of public workers. With the cash-strapped PA currently struggling to pay full salaries to employees, Dr Saidam urges crisis-weary international donors to step up, raising the spectre of chaos and collapse otherwise.    Undermining the legitimacy of the PA is its steady drift towards autocracy. Presidential elections brought Mahmoud Abbas to power for a four-year term in 2005, but now 87 years old, as the head of the PA and PLO, he continues to serve by his own decree overseeing an increasingly broken system.   The last parliamentary elections held in 2006 were won by Fatah's bitter rival, the Islamist party, Hamas, which is committed to the destruction of Israel. Efforts to form a unity government that the world could accept ultimately failed and in 2007, Hamas seized full control of Gaza, after days of deadly inter-factional fighting. It continues to rule there and the damaging internal political rift persists. Parliament remains suspended. While criticising the PA - even on social media - is increasingly risky, those who do speak out argue that today it has become preoccupied with its own survival and maintaining benefits for its leaders.   ""It's the opposite of self-determination and self-government,"" complains Diana Buttu, a Palestinian-Canadian lawyer and former spokesperson for the PLO. ""It's become a dictatorship and rule by those who are unelected, with no real connection to any political process."" Today, Palestinians aged under 35 have never voted in a general election. Ms Buttu and others call for new elections and a definitive push by world powers to force Israel out of occupied territory.  However, foreign players seem unwilling to take bold steps. Back in the heart of Ramallah, the legacy of Oslo shapes the rhythms of daily life as PA workers leave their offices and pupils from government schools head home.   But people of all ages are worried. There is a looming fear of internal strife when the PA's unpopular, elderly president finally leaves the political stage without a clear successor, and then the stress of the daily news. A woman in her 20s recounts how two brothers from her village were killed on the same day by Israeli troops during an incursion late last year. ""Their poor mother received the news like a thunderbolt,"" she says. A shopkeeper, Abu Saleh, will not let his four sons leave the city. ""I'm afraid of crossing paths with the Israeli army and settlers,"" he explains. He no longer visits his brother living an hour's drive away in Nablus.   Recent months have been the bloodiest in the West Bank for years with regular Israeli military raids, a series of shootings by Palestinian militants and growing violence by extremist settlers. Some pockets of the West Bank - particularly in the flashpoints of Nablus and Jenin - have fallen outside the PA's control.  The loss of faith in PA leaders has boosted militants from Hamas and Islamic Jihad still committed to armed struggle against Israel and led to the creation of new, more localised groups. ""We're so tired,"" sighs the young woman in Ramallah, summing up the general mood. ""We just want this conflict to end."" Yet three decades on from a landmark deal, there is no end in sight.  While there is real frustration at today's PA - its international role now entangled with that of the PLO - that is compounded by a sense that it also controls the only real mechanisms for any paths to progress in achieving peace."
Hawkish,Russian atrocities bring Nato closer than ever,2024-09-25,2022-11-26,Katya Adler,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-63754799,"Nato is feeling pretty pleased with itself right now.  Of course when you chat to officials in the soulless, concrete monolith that is Nato HQ here in Brussels, no-one expresses pleasure at the current situation in Europe after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. But they are quick to tell you how surprised, amazed or encouraged they are that the alliance is so ""very"" united.  And that both transatlantic and EU-Nato co-operation on sanctions against Russia, for example, have been so smooth. This is far from always the case.  ""If you'd asked me back in February, or even six months ago, there's no way I'd have predicted the unity we have in our ranks now,"" a US official in Brussels told me. So what's the glue keeping Western allies together?  Just think of the countless headlines we've all read predicting the splintering of Western support. ""Ukraine fatigue"" was heralded this summer, five months into the war.  Then the cost of living crisis and painfully high energy prices linked to Russia's invasion were tipped to reduce Western leaders' support for Kyiv.  With Russia having the largest stockpile of nuclear warheads in the world, it was assumed some countries would prefer to step away from Ukraine for fear of drastic action by Moscow.  But that was not the case. ""The strong resolve to stand with Ukraine that we see now has been helped by atrocities by Russia - targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure,"" a leading Nato official told me on condition of anonymity. Like many of the officials I spoke to, they would prefer to be able to speak more freely. ""A daily diet of war crimes, those images hitting our screens day after day. That makes it hard to turn away.""  Russia has repeatedly denied committing war crimes. Western officials say the Kremlin's tactics have badly misfired.  ""[Moscow] has tried to blackmail or manipulate nations supporting Ukraine with a 'we can make you suffer too' message,"" an official from a large Nato country told me. ""But it's royally backfired. Just like Russia has failed to wear down Ukrainian resolve with the daily war crimes it's imposing on the country."" Vladimir Putin's blaming of Nato's expansion eastwards for the current conflict has also turned into an own goal.  Sweden and Russia's neighbour Finland have opted to join the alliance, after decades preferring non-alignment, as a direct result of the Kremlin's actions. Many officials also linked the unexpected advances of Ukraine's armed forces against Russia with strong Western support. Or, put more cynically, with making it politically far harder for allies to reduce that support. Nato countries are juggling two forms of backing for Ukraine: the practical and the political. The practical is focused on how to structure industries to be able to keep manufacturing and providing military support for Ukraine. Nato officials say aid to Ukraine is more deliberate and long-term now than in the panicked first weeks following Russia's invasion.  But the alliance draws a deliberate line between military support it provides for its own members and Ukraine, where aid is decided and provided by the national governments of Nato members, not by the alliance as a whole. This ""gossamer-thin"" distinction, as one Brussels-based diplomat put it to me, is not recognised by the Kremlin. But it is important to Nato as it desperately tries to avoid coming into a direct, and therefore escalating, conflict with nuclear power Russia.   So, Nato has considerably boosted defence capabilities for its ""Eastern flank"" of member countries geographically close to Russia, but the alliance says it has no organised mission inside Ukraine. It's not training Ukrainian soldiers or providing Kyiv with military support as an organisation.  The political aspect of sustaining support for Ukraine is something the Nato member countries have to manage with their parliament and population back home. Analysts say the cost of helping Ukraine is nothing compared with what the US or European countries like France or the UK spent in Iraq and Afghanistan, but it's worth looking at recent opinion polls in Germany, France and Italy. They suggest waning public support (just 28% in France and Germany and 26% in Italy, according to a study by intelligence group Morning Consult) for ongoing sanctions against Russia that have a direct impact on the cost of living. Yet the leaders of those countries appear unwavering for now in their support for Ukraine. Arguably more steadfast now in fact than earlier in the conflict. What a contrast to the second Gulf War. Then Berlin and Paris didn't hesitate to opt out, prompted by strong anti-war sentiment at home.  So what's going on now?  Simple: Russia's assault on Ukraine is Europe's 9/11, says Camille Grand, until recently assistant secretary general for defence investment at Nato, and now at the European Council for Foreign Relations.  ""[Russia's invasion] has been a massive wake-up call on defence and security,"" he told me. ""A pivotal, game-changing moment, bringing conflict directly to our borders."" Whatever the outcome in Ukraine itself, he predicts the situation in Europe will remain complex - geopolitically and in terms of security - for years to come. A US official in Brussels goes a step further: ""What Russia did caused a paradigm shift for security calculations across the globe.""   It wasn't just Nato recognising this, he said. Other democracies like Japan, New Zealand, South Korea and Australia see Vladimir Putin's actions as a serious threat to the democratic world order. There's a sense that if he is allowed to ""get away with it"" in Ukraine, then no-one is safe.   Not everyone feels this way across the world, of course.  The West and its allies are also accused of hypocrisy and double standards, in their rush to defend Ukraine or call Russia out for war crimes, when Western forces were accused of human rights abuses and war crimes in Iraq, for example.  And the welcome offered to Syrian refugees arriving in Europe in 2015 was distinctly less widespread and effusive than that given to those fleeing war in Ukraine this year.  But back in February at Nato, the shock at Russia's invasion of Ukraine - and the concern about the wider implications if the Kremlin's actions went unchecked - prompted the US to drag itself away from its intended focus on China and the Indo-Pacific. Reluctantly, its attention was back on Europe's military defence - even at the risk of that harming President Joe Biden in the recent mid-term elections (though it didn't seem to dent him in the end).  It was arguably that US resolve, in addition to Russia's actions in Ukraine, that then changed the tune at leadership level in France, Germany and Italy - seen at first by many as too soft on Russia.  Berlin and Rome had close business and energy ties to Moscow. And, to his critics, President Emmanuel Macron seemed seduced by what he perceived as a personal understanding with Vladimir Putin. Fast forward to this autumn, and weapons-delivery shy Germany is now the fourth largest donor of military aid to Ukraine, though the US dwarfs European contributions to an eye-watering degree.  The EU has worked fast at member-state level and as a bloc to wean itself off energy dependency on Russia, and Mr Macron isn't mincing his words these days when it comes to Moscow.   ""War crimes that cannot go unpunished"" is how he described ongoing attacks on Ukrainian civilians and civilian infrastructure this week. Those attacks have left 75% of the capital Kyiv without power and water. ""We did have a few stragglers in the (Nato) waters at the beginning,"" a US official in Brussels told me. ""But no longer."" As for those oft-criticised, still occurring, one-to-one phone calls between German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and in particular President Macron, and Vladimir Putin?  ""[The US] also has open lines of communication with Moscow. Not to discuss the future of Ukraine - that's up to the Ukrainians to decide - but to talk about other issues, like the nuclear question.""  What of the longer term, I wondered. Sometimes it seems that Paris and Berlin think that when the crisis in Ukraine has ended it might be possible to go back to ""business as usual"" with Russia.  The US official said he doubted that. But you could legitimately ask whether it's ever feasible to talk about the future of European security and totally exclude Russia.  As we now head into what Europe fears could be a cold, hard winter, unlike earlier in the conflict, there is no whiff of any Nato big players musing about a negotiated settlement between Russia and Ukraine.  The common consensus is that the West recognises it forced Ukraine into disadvantageous peace talks with Russia in 2014, only for Moscow to come back for more in 2022.  Representatives of Nato countries helping Ukraine's military say they now see their role as supporting Kyiv to perform strongly militarily, so as to be in the most advantageous possible position when the time eventually comes to negotiate with Russia.  That is something President Volodymyr Zelensky says he's not remotely contemplating right now.  Talk of Nato unity of purpose aside, it would be naive to believe no differences exist at all anymore between Ukraine's allies.  The UK is often described as having a more ""hawkish"" stance towards Moscow, alongside Nato members that are geographically closer to Russia or have a recent painful history with it - such as the Baltic States and Poland.  Germany is talked about these days as a ""silent partner"" that pays up and shuts up. The US is depicted as trying to keep the balance, internally within the alliance and externally, to avoid face-to-face military contact with Moscow.  These national differences are described as only ""nuances"" for now.  There are no easy outcomes to this conflict, says defence expert Camille Grand. Just a preferable one, which is Russia's defeat.    But how might Moscow then react? The challenge for all countries involved will surely be to make that end scenario manageable. Whatever it looks like."

Hawkish,Pompeo attacks Russia and China in Berlin speech,2024-09-25,2019-11-08,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-50350545,"US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has warned of the dangers posed by Russia and China, and called on Nato to grow and confront ""the challenges of today"". On a visit to Berlin, Mr Pompeo said methods used by China to suppress its own people would be ""horrifyingly familiar"" to East Germans. And he accused Russia of invading its neighbours and crushing dissent. He laughed off comments from French President Emmanuel Macron, who said recently that Nato was ""brain dead"". But Mr Pompeo told reporters: ""Seventy years on... it needs to grow and change. It needs to confront the realities of today and the challenges of today. ""If nations believe that they can get the security benefit without providing Nato the resources that it needs, if they don't live up to their commitments, there is a risk that Nato could become ineffective or obsolete."" US President Donald Trump has frequently accused European Nato members of failing to provide their fair share of military spending and of relying too heavily on the US for their defence. Nato celebrates its 70th anniversary at a summit in London next month. He was speaking in Berlin a day before the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall. Referring to that event, Mr Pompeo said ""the West - all of us - lost our way in the afterglow of that proud moment"". He said the US and its allies should ""defend what was so hard-won... in 1989"" and ""recognise we are in a competition of values with un-free nations"". ""We thought we could divert our resources away from alliances, and our militaries. We were wrong,"" he said. ""Today, Russia - led by a former KGB officer once stationed in Dresden [President Vladimir Putin] - invades its neighbours and slays political opponents."" In Berlin to remember the end of the first Cold War, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared to be declaring the outbreak of a second.  In insisting upon a ""competition of values"" between the ""free nations"" on the one hand, and Russia and China on the other, his was a message of ideological struggle.  He disparaged entirely the idea of Moscow being a partner for the West. Mr Pompeo clearly saw this speech as a rallying cry to the West. He struck a hawkish tone but many will wonder: What exactly is the fundamental US view?  President Trump seems much less antagonistic towards Moscow and does not appear to share the strategic framework in which his secretary of state places relations between Moscow and Beijing, and the West.  It is clear that even many of Washington's allies do not fully share Mr Pompeo's strident analysis. And Moscow and Beijing are eager to exploit such tensions and divisions.  Relations between Washington and Moscow plummeted after Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula from neighbouring Ukraine in 2014. Ties were further strained when US intelligence agencies concluded that the Kremlin had interfered in the 2016 presidential election. Despite this, President Trump and President Putin have appeared to be on good terms personally. On Friday, Mr Trump said he was considering attending the Victory Day celebrations in Moscow next May, after an invitation from the Russian leader. Mr Pompeo accused the Chinese Communist Party of ""shaping a new vision of authoritarianism"" and warned the German government against using Chinese telecom giant Huawei to build its fifth-generation data network (5G). Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang reacted angrily, accusing Mr Pompeo of ideological prejudice and having a Cold War mindset.  ""Attempts to separate the Chinese people and the Chinese Communist Party are a provocation against the entire Chinese people and are doomed to fail,"" he said. Interviewed by the Economist, the French president said he saw a waning commitment to the alliance by its main guarantor, the US. He warned European members that they could no longer rely on the US to defend the alliance, established at the start of the Cold War to bolster Western European and North American security. He cited the recent failure by Washington to consult Nato before pulling forces out of northern Syria. Mr Macron also questioned whether Nato was still committed to collective defence. Speaking on Thursday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, a key ally, said she disagreed with Mr Macron's ""drastic words"". Speaking in Berlin alongside visiting Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, she acknowledged there were problems, but said she did not think ""such sweeping judgements are necessary"". Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, however, said Mr Macron had given ""an accurate description of Nato's current state"". ""Well said. Truthful words, and ones that get to the nub of the matter,"" she posted on Facebook."
Hawkish,US foreign policy after the election,2024-09-25,2016-08-01,Jonathan Marcus,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2016-36942612,"America's allies are weighing up the foreign policy approaches of both main candidates Who sits in the White House matters for the world. For the United States, despite all the reports about its relative decline and diminishing influence, remains the one truly global power.  This year's presidential race is being watched even more closely by governments and foreign ministers around the world.  That is because this is a race like no other. It is hard to remember a candidate as out of step with the existing foreign policy mainstream as the Republican contender Donald Trump.  His views on Russia, on Nato, on Muslims, Mexico - you name it - are at variance with the policies that have dominated US foreign policy thinking for decades.  True, Mr Trump's populist call reflects a frustration with politics as usual which has echoes in many other countries.  Britain's vote to leave the European Union had an element of this.  So too does the rise of populist far-right parties such as the National Front in France.  But a US president with such views would be an unwelcome and uncomfortable problem for most of America's allies. The foreign ministries and embassies of Washington's partners are weighing up the political campaigns, trying to determine not just who might win, but what might their policies be? Who might become the key policy players? And how might the essential direction of US policy change? As a former Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton has a firm grasp of the complexities of diplomacy If Hillary Clinton were to win, most of those questions are relatively easy to answer. As a former Secretary of State under President Obama she is a known quantity. So are many of the people around her.  Some analysts have commented on a more hawkish streak in Mrs Clinton's make-up - there are those in her circle who have advocated a more activist approach on Syria for example.  But under Mrs Clinton there would be a significant degree of continuity in US foreign policy. That, as far as can be determined, would not be the case under a President Trump.  Donald Trump was host of US reality TV show The Apprentice until 2015, where his trademark catchphrase was ""You're fired"" As a businessman and reality TV star he has no real experience of foreign policy whatsoever.  It is far from clear who would occupy the key jobs in a Trump administration. His campaign has been largely deserted by the ""A"" team of Republican foreign policy experts and much of the ""B"" team as well!  Much of Mr Trump's thinking seems muddled.  Donald Trump's top four 'deals' for foreign policy Trump's foreign policy: So crazy it just might work? Trump v Clinton on foreign policy In his recent ABC interview for example,  it was not clear that he fully understood Russia's role in Ukraine - first commenting that Russian President Vladimir Putin was ""not going into Ukraine"" and when told that Russia through its seizure of Crimea  was already there, Mr Trump accepted ""well, he's there in a certain way"".  For some, this seemed to hold out the possibility that a Trump administration might accept the annexation of Ukraine to further better relations with Moscow. A mural in Vilnius expresses the fear of Lithuanians that a President Trump may seek better US relations with Mr Putin and ignore Baltic security issues Mr Trump's views on Russia epitomise why his rise is causing such concern among Washington's European allies.  Mr Trump has not just mitigated criticism of the seizure of Crimea. He has raised questions about his willingness to come to the aid of a Nato ally threatened by Moscow.  The close ties of his campaign strategist Paul Manafort with the Russian-backed former Ukrainian President Victor Yanukovych have also raised eyebrows, as have the allegations of Russian hacking of Democratic Party e-mail servers.   Mr Trump's campaign manager Paul Manafort was adviser to former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych The motivation behind Mr Trump's stance on Russia is unclear. He obviously thinks he can ""do business"" with Mr Putin.  He may not be Mr Putin's man. He is not ""the Siberian candidate"" as some critics have dubbed him (in a reference to 1962 film The Manchurian Candidate in which a right-wing politician becomes the stooge of a communist conspiracy).   But he is self-evidently the candidate that Mr Putin would like to see elected.  Mr Trump's statements about the world are mostly a combination of rhetoric, bravado and bluster. One struggles to draw a coherent foreign policy from them.  But from what he has said so far it suggests that a Trump administration would be ""interesting"" to say the least.

Hawkish,"TikTok singer, 110, goes viral with WW1 song",2024-09-25,2021-01-30,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-55871140,"A 110-year-old great-grandmother has become an overnight singing sensation on TikTok. Amy Hawkins' rendition of the popular World War One song It's A Long Way to Tipperary was captured by her great-grandson on her milestone birthday. Since then Sacha, 14, has clocked up 100,000 views of the video. Ms Hawkins, of Monmouth, was a performer and at Sacha's age toured the UK - but her mother banned her from the stage, as it was not ""respectable"". Sacha's mother Hannah Freeman, said the reaction to the video on the social-media site has ""restored faith in humanity"". Ms Hawkins, aged seven at the end of the war, has sung songs from that era ever since. ""She's like a clock, once you wind her up she won't stop. She just keeps asking, 'Would you like another one?',"" said Ms Freeman, her granddaughter. Ms Hawkins was touring with a dance group when her mother banned her from such a career. She now lives with three other generations of her family and Ms Freeman said they ""feel very lucky"" to have been able to spend lockdown together. ""Gran is the centre of it all - we just pivot around her,"" she said. The TikTok app, which only launched in 2016, currently has more than one billion users, who create and share short videos on the platform. Ms Freeman said she was ""almost joking"" when she suggested Sacha should feature her in a video, but they ""could not believe"" the response. ""She is brilliant, so down to earth, and nothing phases her,"" she said. She added Sacha and his great-grandmother had a ""real bond"" and he ""loves her to bits"". ""Reading the comments, people have been in tears, because they miss their family or about family they have lost,"" she said. ""I think that has been a real lesson for Sacha too and has restored my faith in humanity in such a difficult time for everyone."" Sacha said his highlight has been seeing all the comments about ""people missing their family during Covid and how lovely my grandma is""."
Hawkish,Is North Korea's leader actually considering war?,2024-09-25,2024-01-23,Frances Mao,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-68052515,"North Korea experts - by nature, a cautious group who seek to avoid sowing panic - have been left reeling by two of their own. Last week, the two eminent analysts dropped a bomb - so to speak - in stating their belief that the pariah state's leader is preparing for war. Kim Jong Un has scrapped the bedrock goal of reconciling and re-uniting with South Korea, they said. Instead, he's presenting the North and South as two independent states at war with each other. ""We believe, that like his grandfather in 1950, Kim Jong Un has made a strategic decision to go to war,"" wrote Robert L Carlin, a former CIA analyst and Siegfried S Hecker, a nuclear scientist who's visited the North several times, in an article on specialist site 38 North. Such a pronouncement set off alarm bells in Washington and Seoul, and a massive debate in North Korea watching circles. Most analysts, however, disagree with the war theory; the BBC spoke to seven experts across Asia, Europe and North America -  none of whom supported the idea. ""Risking his entire regime on a potentially cataclysmic conflict is not on-brand for the North Koreans. They have proven to be ruthlessly Machiavellian,"" says Christopher Green, a Korea watcher from Crisis Group based in the Netherlands. He and others note the North often acts out to bring Western powers to the table for dialogue; and there are political pressures at home too. But they do agree that Mr Kim's increased bluster can't be ignored and his regime has grown more dangerous. While most argue war may still be unlikely, some fear a more limited attack could yet be on the cards. Close watchers of North Korea's Kim Jong Un are used to his nuclear threats, but some say the latest messages from Pyongyang are of a different nature. Six days on from his New Year's Eve declaration that ""it is fait accompli that a war can break out anytime on the Korean peninsula"", his military blasted artillery across the border. North Korea has also claimed a test of a new solid-fuelled missile, and its underwater attack drones, which can supposedly carry a nuclear weapon, since the start of January. They follow on from two years of near-monthly missile launches and weapons development in blatant contravention of UN sanctions. However, it was his announcement of formally abandoning the goal of unification that last week furrowed brows.  Reuniting with the South had always been a key - if increasingly unrealistic - part of the North's ideology since the inception of the state. ""This is a big deal. It fundamentally alters one of the regime's core ideological precepts,"" says Peter Ward, a senior researcher at Kookmin University in Seoul. Kim Jong Un would now be tearing down that legacy - literally. Along with shutting diplomacy channels and cross-border radio broadcasts, he has announced he will demolish the Reunification Arch, a nine-storey monument on the outskirts of Pyongyang. The arch, showing two women in traditional Korean dress reaching towards each other, had been built in 2001 to mark his father's and grandfather's efforts towards the goal of reunification.  Satellite pictures released by Planet Labs on Tuesday appear to show the arch may already have been destroyed, although there's no official confirmation of this. Kim Il Sung had been the one who went to war in 1950, but he was also the one who set the idea that at some point North Koreans would be united with their southern kin again.  But his grandson has now chosen to define South Koreans as different people altogether - perhaps to justify them as a military target. Mr Carlin and Dr Hecker, the analysts who predicted war, have interpreted all of this as signs that Kim Jong Un has settled on actually pursuing a fight. But most analysts disagree. Seong-Hyon Lee, from the George HW Bush Foundation for US-China relations, points out the country is due to reopen to foreign tourists next month, and it has also sold its own shells to Russia for war - something it could ill afford if it were preparing for the battlefields. The ultimate deterrent, however, is that were the North to launch an attack, the US and South Korea armies are just so much more advanced. ""A general war could kill a lot of people in the South, but it would be the end of Kim Jong Un and his regime,"" says Kookmin University's Mr Ward.  Instead, he and others warn the conditions are building for a smaller action. ""I'm much more concerned, in general, about a limited attack on South Korea… an attack of that sort would take aim at South Korean territory or military forces but be limited in scope,"" says analyst Ankit Panda, from the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. This could even be in the form of shelling or attempted occupation of contested islands west of the Korean peninsula. In 2010, the North struck the island of Yeonpyeong killing four South Korean soldiers, infuriating the South. A similar provocation again could be done to test the South Korea's limits, analysts suggest, and to push the buttons of President Yoon Suk Yeol, a defiantly hawkish leader who has vowed to respond to a North Korean attack with punishment ""multiple times more severe"". ""North Korea may expect to draw out a disproportionate retaliatory attack from Seoul,"" says Mr Panda, something that might spark a broader escalation in fighting. Others say war fears should also be put in the context of Kim's operating patterns. ""Looking at the history of North Korea, it has often used provocation to attract the attention of other countries when it wants to negotiate,"" says Seong-Hyon Lee. The regime continues to suffer from economic sanctions and 2024 is an election year for its enemies - with the US presidential vote and South Korean legislature poll. ""This presents a good opportunity for Kim Jong Un to provoke,"" explains Dr Lee. The current US administration under President Joe Biden - tied up with Ukraine and Gaza - hasn't paid North Korea much heed and Pyongyang has also typically had most engagement with Republican administrations. Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump famously had a bromance in 2019 before the denuclearisation talks soured - and the North Korean leader may be waiting for the former US president to return to the White House, where he might weaken the alliance with South Korea and be open to dialogue again. North Korea's closer friendship with Russia and continued economic support from China in the past year may have also boosted its audacity, analysts suggest. It's received technical help from Russia to achieve a long-term goal of launching its spy satellites and the two states had several high-profile meetings including a leaders summit last year. ""Much of what we're seeing is a result of broader North Korean confidence in its own capabilities and its geopolitical position given Russian, and to a lesser degree, Chinese support,"" says Mr Panda. And others say Kim Jong Un's behaviour is all aimed at stabilising his own regime. ""This appears to be an ideological adjustment for regime survival,"" argues Professor Leif-Eric Easley from Ewha University in Seoul. ""North Koreans are increasingly aware of their Communist country's failings compared to the South."" He suggests a policy focused on defining the enemy is intended to justify Mr Kim's missile spending during a difficult time. There are reports of starvation across the country. Presenting the South as the enemy also makes it easier to resolve ""cognitive dissonance at the heart"" of the North's view on South Korea, points out Mr Ward. ""Previously it was an indelibly evil state that was supposed to be the object of unification with a hopelessly corrupting culture that should not be consumed under any circumstances but with people who need to be liberated from their evil government,"" says Mr Ward. ""Now the country and its culture can just be branded evil and that justifies the continued crackdown on South Korean culture.""  The BBC last week published rare footage showing two North Korean teenagers sentenced to 12 years hard labour for watching and distributing K-dramas. ""He doesn't actually want a war - a huge gamble where he would have nothing to gain and everything to lose"", says Sokeel Park, from Liberty in North Korea, an NGO helping North Korean refugees. His threats are instead aimed at cementing his new North and South policy, designed ultimately to shore up his power at home, he says. While it's important for South Korea, the US and allies to prepare for the worst-case scenario, it is also worth a thorough examination of the internal situation in North Korea and the wider geopolitics, analysts say. At the end of the day, the best way to find out what the North's leader is thinking is to engage with him, argues Dr Lee. ""The international community does not see the US talking to Kim Jong Un as surrendering to Kim Jong Un's threats. It is seen as a necessary means to achieve a goal,"" he says. ""If necessary, one should consider meeting with the leader of an enemy nation to reduce misjudgements and prevent war."" With reporting by Kelly Ng Update 20 Sept 2024: This article has been amended to reflect that the teenagers had also distributed the K-dramas."
Hawkish,Surprise fall in UK inflation rate,2024-09-25,2016-11-15,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-37986365,"The UK inflation rate registered a surprise fall in October, although there were signs that the pressure on consumer prices is starting to build. Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation fell to 0.9%, from 1% in September, the Office for National Statistics said. , external That was below the 1.1% predicted by economists, who said sterling's fall would push October's CPI higher. However, the ONS said factory gate prices and the costs of raw materials rose much faster in October. The price of goods leaving factories rose by 2.1%, faster than expected and the biggest increase since April 2012. And costs faced by producers for raw materials and oil showed a record monthly jump in October, up by 4.6%. ""After initially pushing up the prices of raw materials, the recent fall in the value of the pound is now starting to boost the price of goods leaving factories as well,"" ONS statistician Mike Prestwood said. ""However, aside from fuel, there is no clear evidence that these pressures have so far fed through to the prices in shops,"" he said. The cost of clothing and university tuition fees rose more slowly than in 2015, however, helping to keep inflation in check.  The ONS said certain games and toys, overnight hotel stays and non-alcoholic beverages fell in price. But there is an expectation among economists that inflation is set to rise, fuelled by the fall in the value of sterling since the Brexit referendum in June, which has pushed up the cost of imports. On Tuesday, Bank of England governor Mark Carney told the Treasury Committee that ""the thinking now is that inflation is going to go above target... We see more inflation coming through in 2017-18, and then a tail in 2019."" Inflation has been below the Bank's 2% target for nearly three years. Last year it was zero, the lowest since comparable records began in 1950. The pound has fallen about 16% against the dollar and about 11% against the euro since June. Chris Williamson, chief economist at IHS Markit said that despite October's CPI fall, the trend over the coming months would be upwards as rising factory costs feed through to consumers. ""It's therefore likely to be only a matter of time before price hikes in retailers' supply chains start feeding through to the customer, as retailers seek to protect margins,"" he said.  ""The concern is that consumers are driving the economy at the moment, and higher inflation is starting to eat into people's spending power, subduing consumer spending."" Nick Dixon, investment director at Aegon, said the trajectory for interest rates was also upwards. ""While slowing price growth may have come as a surprise to the markets, the days of low interest rates are numbered,"" he said. ""We're likely to see hawkish calls intensify among Bank of England officials in coming months. Despite the sluggish pace of inflation, the next 12 months are likely to see interest rates rise faster and higher than expected."" Earlier this month, the Bank of England forecast that inflation would rise to about 2.7% by this time next year. The Retail Prices Index (RPI) - a separate measure of inflation, which includes housing costs - was 2% in October, unchanged from September, the ONS said. Earlier this month, the ONS announced that from March 2017, there would be a new measure of inflation that would include the cost of owning a home. Inflation figures to include home costs Bank sees sharp rise in inflation in 2017 Inflation means inflation, but who wins? How quickly are prices rising in the UK?"
