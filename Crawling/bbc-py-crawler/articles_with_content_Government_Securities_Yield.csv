Government Securities Yield,British tech tycoon: I only got justice because I'm rich,2024-09-14,2024-08-01,Tom Gerken & Tom Singleton,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4ng14j5vqpo,"The British businessman Mike Lynch, who this June was acquitted in the US of a multi-billion pound fraud, has said he believes he was only able to clear his name because of his huge wealth. Mr Lynch, 59, was facing two decades in jail if had been convicted of the 17 charges he faced, relating to the sale of his tech company, Autonomy, to US firm Hewlett-Packard. He told the the PM programme, on BBC Radio 4, that though convinced of his innocence throughout, he was only able to prove it in a US court because he was rich enough to pay the enormous legal fees involved. ""You shouldn't need to have funds to protect yourself as a British citizen"", he said.  ""The reason I'm sitting here, let's be honest, is not only because I was innocent... but because I had enough money not to be swept away by a process that's set up to sweep you away."" He said most people, even they sold all their assets, would run out of funds in a matter of months, a situation that he said ""has to change."" Mr Lynch co-founded Autonomy in Cambridge in 1996. The software company expanded rapidly, becoming one of the UK's leading tech firms. Its success led to Mr Lynch once being dubbed ""Britain's Bill Gates."" In 2011, hardware giant Hewlett-Packard bought the firm for $11bn (£8.6bn) - a deal Mr Lynch made £500m from. The acquisition soon unravelled though as questions were asked about the enormous price tag. Just a year later, HP wrote down the value of Autonomy - which it said Mr Lynch had exaggerated - by $8.8bn. Years of legal battles followed then, in 2018, US prosecutors brought charges against Mr Lynch. They accused him of inflating the value of the firm by using backdated agreements to mislead about the company's sales, said he had concealed the firm's loss-making business reselling hardware, and also accused him of intimidating or paying off people who raised concerns. They sought to try him in the US - a move Mr Lynch, who lives in Suffolk, resisted. But he was eventually extradited to the US in 2022 to face trial - a process culminated in June this year with Mr Lynch's acquittal. He testified in court that he was not involved in the transactions being described while his legal team argued HP had failed to properly vet the deal. Another former finance executive at Autonomy, Stephen Chamberlain, was also  found not guilty. Mr Lynch said the moment he awaited his verdict was ""indescribable"" and like standing ""between two universes"". ""Until you hear the words, you can't call it"", he explained. But now that he has been acquitted, he has criticised the government for allowing his extradition in the first place under a treaty which critics - such as Mr Lynch - say makes it far too easy for British people to be tried in the US. ""The British government needs to defend its citizens,"" he said. ""Is it right to be sending someone to another country, especially one which has the justice system issues of the US? ""A US prosecutor has far more control over you than your local bobby in the British system."" The charges Mr Lynch was cleared of are not the only legal proceedings arising out of the sale of Autonomy. In 2019, Autonomy's former chief financial officer Sushovan Hussain was jailed for five years and fined millions of dollars on 16 counts of fraud, securities fraud and other charges. In 2022, HP won a civil fraud case against Mr Lynch and Hussain heard by London's High Court.  It is now seeking a reported $4bn. Mr Lynch blamed that on the judge in the case being presented with untested evidence from the US. He says now though he wants to refocus on his career in tech - saying his recent experiences have given him an interest in how AI can be used in the legal field as well as to help with with hearing loss. ""I want to get back to what I love doing, which is innovating"", he said."
Government Securities Yield,British tech tycoon cleared in US fraud trial,2024-09-14,2024-06-06,Natalie Sherman,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cneel8ed2vvo,"British tech tycoon Mike Lynch has been cleared of fraud charges he faced in the US over the $11bn (£8.6bn) sale of his software firm to Hewlett-Packard in 2011. A jury in San Francisco found him not guilty on all counts in a stunning victory for Mr Lynch, who had been accused of inflating the value of Autonomy, his company, ahead of its sale. Mr Lynch, who faced more than 20 years in prison if convicted, had denied the charges and took the stand to defend himself. In his testimony, he maintained he had focused on technology not accounting, distancing himself from other executives, including the company's former chief financial officer who was already successfully prosecuted for fraud. ""I am elated with today’s verdict and grateful to the jury for their attention to the facts over the last 10 weeks,"" Mr Lynch said in a statement.   ""I am looking forward to returning to the UK and getting back to what I love most: my family and innovating in my field."" University of Cambridge graduate Mr Lynch co-founded Autonomy in 1996 out of a specialist software research group called Cambridge Neurodynamics. He led it as it grew to be one of the UK's biggest companies, winning him comparisons to Microsoft's Bill Gates and Apple's Steve Jobs.  The company, known for software that could extract useful information from ""unstructured"" sources such as phone calls, emails or video, was ultimately sold to Hewlett-Packard (HP) in 2011 in a deal that ranked as the largest-ever takeover of a British technology business at the time. Mr Lynch made £500m from the sale. Just a year later, HP wrote down the value of Autonomy by $8.8bn. Years of legal battles followed.  The company's chief financial officer, Sushovan Hussain, was found guilty of fraud in 2018 and later sentenced to five years in prison.  US prosecutors brought charges against Mr Lynch in 2018, accusing him of inflating the value of the firm using backdated agreements to mislead about the company's sales; concealing the firm's loss-making business reselling hardware and intimidating or paying off people who raised concerns. Mr Lynch, who lives in Suffolk, was eventually extradited after a UK judge ruled in favour of HP in a similar civil fraud case in 2022. HP is seeking a reported $4bn in that case. Mr Lynch, a former UK government adviser who sat on the boards of the BBC and the British Library, had faced house arrest in the US while preparing for the trial which began in San Francisco in March.  Prosecutors had called dozens of witnesses to the stand, including the former head of HP Leo Apotheker, who was fired shortly after the purchase was announced. But the arguments fell flat. Mr Lynch's team pushed the argument that HP had failed to properly vet the deal and mismanaged the takeover, while he testified he was uninvolved with the transactions being described. Judge Charles Breyer had already dismissed one count of securities fraud during the trial for lack of evidence.  Abraham Simmons, a spokesman for the US Attorney's Office, said: ""We acknowledge and respect the verdict.  ""We would like to thank the jury for its attentiveness to the evidence the government presented in this case."" As well as Mr Lynch, another former finance executive at Autonomy, Stephen Chamberlain, was also on trial. He was found not guilty. Lawyers for Mr Lynch, Christopher Morvillo and Brian Heberlig, said in a statement that they were thrilled by the outcome, saying it reflected a ""rejection of the government's profound overreach in this case"".  ""This verdict closes the book on a relentless 13-year effort to pin HP's well-documented ineptitude on Dr Lynch,"" they said. ""Thankfully, the truth has finally prevailed."""
Government Securities Yield,US pushes ahead with new rules for Chinese firms,2024-09-14,2020-12-03,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-55169476,"The US House of Representatives has passed a law to kick Chinese companies off US stock exchanges if they do not comply with its auditing rules.  The act would also require companies to disclose whether they are owned or controlled by a foreign government. The Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act still needs the US president’s approval.  The move coincides with a wider push to ramp up pressure on China in the final months of the Trump presidency.  In addition to the act, the US government on Wednesday moved to ban cotton imports from a company it says uses the forced labour of detained Uighur Muslims.  The US also took action against Chinese-manufactured twist ties last week, taking the rare step of imposing tariffs to counter the effects of what the US claims is Chinese currency manipulation.  China too has increased pressure, introducing export control laws earlier this week.   This was widely seen as a response to US export controls on microchips that many Chinese tech companies rely on.   The act will have little effect over the short term, as foreign companies are only banned if they fail to comply with audits for three years in a row. The American Securities Association welcomed the bill’s passage, but urged the government to act more swiftly by delisting non-compliant companies by the middle of next year.  The legislation applies to publicly-listed companies from any country, but its sponsors intended for it to target Chinese companies. “US policy is letting China flout rules that American companies play by, and it’s dangerous. Today, the House joined the Senate in rejecting a toxic status quo,” said Republican Senator John Kennedy, who is one of the bill’s authors.  The US-China Economic and Security Review Commission - which was created by Congress to track possible security threats from China - said that as of October there were 217 Chinese companies listed on these US exchanges. A number of US-listed Chinese firms, including Alibaba and KFC China operator Yum China, have recently carried out secondary listings in Hong Kong. The Trump administration also banned cotton imports from a Chinese state-owned enterprise it said has used the forced labour of detained Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang province. The Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (XPCC) is a quasi-military organisation that reportedly accounts for nearly a fifth of Xinjiang’s GDP.   It is also one of China’s largest cotton producers.  US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) personnel have been ordered to detain shipments containing cotton and cotton products originating from XPCC. “China’s systemic abuse of forced labour in the Xinjiang Region should disturb every American business and consumer,” said CBP Acting Commissioner Mark A. Morgan in a statement.  Beijing has faced international condemnation for its network of detention centres in Xinjiang which mostly house Muslim minorities. China has rejected the criticism, saying its aim is to tackle poverty and religious extremism in Xinjiang."
Government Securities Yield,Boxing gym teaches men to avoid toxic masculinity,2024-09-14,2023-07-18,By Liz Clements,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-66222043,"""I always viewed men as the alphas in relationships, it was more, 'I'll take care of everything, you guys just look pretty… not in a disrespectful way'."" Farrell Rafferty's views on how a man is supposed to act and his attitude towards women have evolved a lot. He has taken part in helping shape a campaign that encourages young men to learn about gender-based violence. The Welsh government said it hopes its ""Sound"" campaign can make Wales the ""safest place in Europe for women"". Farrell is part of St Joseph's Boxing Gym, and was one of a group of young men who discussed topics like toxic masculinity, coercive control and behaviours that can lead to violence against women to help shape the campaign. The 25-year-old amateur boxer said he ""definitely viewed women in a different way"" until growing up and then he ""realised that was wrong"". He believes calling friends out on problematic behaviour is vital. ""I have a pretty influential friendship group, where if one of us are doing something wrong, we will get pulled up on it,"" he said. ""A lot of men, I think they're scared of pulling their friends up on things, 'cos they think they're going to lose that friendship. But if you are a true friend, a real friend, you'd know when you're doing wrong."" Mr Rafferty said going to St Joseph's boxing gym and speaking with other men is so important. ""It's not just about punching people in the face,"" he said. ""We are going through difficulties in our life and we know we can always talk to each other. It encourages men to talk more."" Patrick Bilongo believes the media, musicians and rappers have a lot to answer for when it comes to influencing men's behaviour. The 20-year-old said TV taught him ""you're not supposed to cry, you're not supposed to show emotions"". He said now he had learned it was actually ""completely the opposite, and all right to do so"". The amateur boxer said some rappers' behaviour was not a realistic representation of ""what real life is like."" There was an incident a few weeks ago when he was with someone who wolf-whistled a woman. ""I let my friend know, that's a human being, that's not a dog or a cat that you can just whistle at. Show more respect,"" he said. He wants to encourage other men to ""be more human"", and to remind their friends to treat people with respect. ""It's something you need to repeat all the time so their mentality will change,"" he said. Mr Bilongo said before the campaign, he did not know about behaviours like lovebombing (showering someone with intense displays of affection to lure them into or keep them in a relationship) or coercive control. The campaign will target young men with informative content on social media, podcasts, TV and streaming channels. Rhian Bowen-Davies, an independent consultant in the field of violence against women, said: ""It's a really good first step in terms of the prevention, early intervention and that societal wide condemnation of violence against women"". She said ""men need to understand the role that they play"" in stopping and calling out problematic behaviours which can ""end up in the situation where violence against women is prevalent"".  She called the campaign being ""co-produced with young men"" exciting. ""It's got the potential to reach audiences that other campaigns haven't done because of the platforms it's going to use and the messages it's sending,"" she said. ""It makes me feel that we have an opportunity that we can feel safer. If I was to go through life and learned what I've learned and experience what I've experienced, and I don't pass that on, what was I here for?"" Zhivago Greaux has been a boxing coach for about eight years, and is proactive in his approach toward shaping young men in the gym. ""People look at it and think I'm a boxing coach but you're really trying to shape them into good people,"" he said. ""You pass on your life experiences. Even though you're doing it through a boxing coach lens... you still instil different disciplines into these young kids. He said even before the campaign, he talked ""a lot about toxic masculinity."" ""I like to have an open gym and conversation, I want to open their minds,"" said the Newport coach. He said sharing his own insecurities and feelings encouraged young men to open up too. ""Currently, I feel we don't have safe spaces for men to talk. I think what we need to do, and what I've tried to do here myself is create an environment that allows men to talk. I encourage it,"" the 38-year-old said. He believes with the rise of misogyny, and figures like the social media influencer Andrew Tate on social media, it is a very ""scary space we're in at the moment"". ""The influence I see he's had on some of the younger kids… that's scary. Scary for me as a man, as a person, as a human - let alone the further impact that could have on women,"" he said. Mr Zhivago believes he is now ""trying to fight that battle to say 'let's actually be open, let's talk about our feelings, emotions etc, and understand what a male role model really is.'"" Social Justice Minister Jane Hutt said the campaign was ""really important as misogyny, sexism, violence against women - and domestic abuse, it's in the news every day and people talk about it as an epidemic."" ""It is sad to say in this day and age that younger men still don't recognise that actually women, young women and women of all age groups are still subject to unacceptable levels of violence and sexual harassment,"" Ms Hutt said."
Government Securities Yield,Keeping your bond portfolio safe,2024-09-14,2014-11-03,Constance Gustke,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20131017-keeping-your-bond-portfolio-safe,"The United States narrowly avoided defaulting on its debt — this time — with its last-minute deal to raise the debt limit. That means Treasuries, the most widely held securities in the world, are still a safe haven. It had appeared touch-and-go for a short time, however. Amid the political wrangling in Washington DC, investors had avoided buying short-term Treasuries and yields spiked as the very real risk of default grew. With another debt ceiling battle likely early next year, the message for investors is clear: bond diversification isn’t just a good idea, it’s necessary. BBC Capital spoke with four experts to find out what you need to know to keep your bond portfolio safe from future debt limit battles — and more. Edited excerpts follow with Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics; Samuel Rines, an economist at Chilton Capital Management; Guy LeBas, chief fixed-income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott; and Matt King, chief investment officer at Bell Investment Advisors. Q: If Congress hadn’t raised the debt ceiling, would financial Armageddon have followed?  Zandi: On October 17, the (US) government wouldn’t have actually defaulted on its debt. Thursday is the day the government was shut off from borrowing more money. Instead, the Treasury would be forced to draw on the cash that it already has on hand. By early November, government coffers would be running dry, though. True Treasury default would occur on November 15, when a big payment is due.   Besides that, investor confidence would rapidly erode. If investors didn’t get paid for their Treasury holdings, they would sue the government. Also, investors would demand higher interest rates on Treasuries to compensate for higher default risk, triggering inflation. Short-term investors, rather than ones holding long-term Treasury bonds, would be very worried about getting their money back as the government began defaulting on payments. At some point, we would have a TARP moment. [In 2008 Congress tried to unfreeze the money markets by passing the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). That money bought up mortgage-backed securities from financial institutions. It did not pass in Congress on the first vote and stocks fell nearly 9% that day.]  Investors would head to the door. This scenario makes the probability of default unimaginable. Q: Treasuries are also the glue that holds the financial system together, right?  Rines: Yes. Almost all debt is priced off of Treasuries.  So there would be no risk-free assets for investors. Treasuries are also widely help by European banks, which have shifted into safer US and European bonds. So any default would have ripples worldwide, including to banks. LeBas:  Default threat has already affected the repurchase agreement market, which is essentially a secured loan that uses Treasuries as collateral. In theory, smaller banks could fail as defaults piled up. Also, many US bonds use Treasury yields as a benchmark.  So, Treasuries have their tentacles in every corner of the financial market. Q: How would money market funds, held by large numbers of investors, have been affected, since they hold a lot of Treasuries? In 2008, one money market wrote off bad debt and ended up breaking the buck, triggering investor panic. Rines: some major financial firms like Fidelity have avoided buying short-term Treasuries. Financial firms have developed a capital preservation mentality, since they know what can happen during a financial crisis. LeBas: Yes, many money markets have been preparing for the past week by hording cash and protecting themselves.  They’ve been doing a good job getting ready for this Congressional showdown. Only minimal amounts of money have flowed out of money markets, which means that investors had not panicked.   Q:  Congress has essentially just kicked the debt ceiling can down the road. How can investors protect themselves during future Congressional standoffs? Zandi: there’s really nowhere to hide if the government defaults. Everything would get crushed. However, long-term Treasuries, which have much longer maturities [usually 10 to 30 years] than T-bills, may do better than anything else. However, if you’re holding emerging market bonds, they’ll go down like everything else. Rines: International bonds funds are a good way to diversify. There is a lot of government paper in Germany and the UK to buy, and these governments don’t have this same dysfunction. Cash is also a good go-to place if it looks like there will be a default. LeBas: Investors should always have about 10% of their portfolio in overseas bonds, especially sovereign ones, which are issued by governments, and high-quality corporate bond offerings. King: Nervous investors learned some valuable lessons during the 2011 government debt-ceiling crisis. They wanted to go into cash. However, the investors who did were later left on the sidelines when the markets recovered. It was a painful lesson. So don’t let political risk deter you from your financial plans. Sit tight and wait it out. Investors should have a diversified fixed-income portfolio. Foreign bond exposure helps you hedge your currency risk. When parking money, look at high-yield savings accounts, which offer higher yields than money markets and no risk.

Government Securities Yield,Morning business round-up,2024-09-14,2011-11-09,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-15656642,"What made the business news in Asia and Europe this morning? Here's our daily business round-up: Italy's bond yields continued to soar on Wednesday, with the yield on 10-year bonds rising well above 7% - a rate which many analysts deem to be unsustainable. The rise comes a day after Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi said he would resign once budget reforms are passed.  The yield was pushed up as a clearing house asked for a larger deposit to trade Italian bonds - to cover the increased risk of non-payment. Investors increasingly fear that Italy could become the next victim of the debt crisis. The head of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, has warned that the global economy is at risk of being plunged into a ""lost decade"". Ms Lagarde said the ongoing debt crisis in Europe had resulted in an uncertain outlook for the global economy. The IMF chief added that while efforts to solve the crisis were heading in the right direction, more needed to be done to restore confidence. China's inflation rate fell for a third straight month in October, as the government continues to try to cool economic growth.  Consumer prices rose 5.5% in October compared with the same month a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said. That is down from 6.1% in September, and a three-year high of 6.5% in July.  The government has identified inflation as one of the main threats to the country's economic stability. Global bank HSBC has reported shrinking underlying profits and warned of a ""very challenging"" outlook. Its headline profit before tax was actually up 66% to $5.2bn (£3.2bn) in the third quarter of the year, mainly thanks to a revaluation of its own debts, the value of which has fallen in volatile markets. But underlying profits fell 36% because of weak business, as well as bad debts in the US.

Government Securities Yield,Inside the life coaching cult that takes over lives,2024-09-14,2023-04-04,"Catrin Nye, Natalie Truswell and Jamie Bartlett",https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-65175712,"Lighthouse promises life coaching to help people realise their dreams. But an 18-month investigation by the BBC finds it takes over people's lives, separates people from their loved ones and harasses its critics. Jeff Leigh-Jones had only been part of Lighthouse for a few months when his girlfriend Dawn noticed something strange was going on. Jeff no longer seemed himself. Jeff had joined the pioneering life coaching and mentoring group to help him find more direction. He had been planning a solo hike to the South Pole, and thought a coach could help him get more disciplined. But then Jeff began spending all day on secretive phone calls and avoiding friends and family - he even sold his house to invest more money in the group. One day, Dawn overheard one of Jeff's many supposedly motivational daily calls. It wasn't about the South Pole at all - it was about her. Jeff was told he needed to choose between Lighthouse and his family. In November 2021, Dawn contacted the BBC. ""We've had private investigator reports into Lighthouse,"" she says. But ""you can only ever go so far"". She was nervous. Lighthouse isn't an ordinary life coaching organisation, Dawn explained. ""It's a cult."" Life coaching is a booming UK industry. There are an estimated 80,000 to 100,000 people working in the field.  Unlike many therapists or counsellors, who are trained to help people come to terms with difficult or traumatic pasts, coaches say they focus more on clients' futures. In theory at least, they try to help people work out what they really want and how to get there. In the past few years, Lighthouse - formally known as Lighthouse International Group and based in the Midlands in England - has received hundreds of thousands of pounds from mentees. It boasts of helping thousands of people.  Set up in 2012 by businessman Paul Waugh, it claims to be different from most life coaching groups.  Its founder, who grew up in South Africa and tells people he was a multimillionaire by the age of 35, says he has developed a revolutionary approach by fixing people's spiritual wellbeing. When Jeff found the group via an online book club run by a Lighthouse devotee called Jai Singh, he thought it could help him too.  Jeff says he was looking for inspiration from someone successful and Jai - a former property developer in his late 30s with a calm and engaging manner - seemed to be just the man.  ""I thought he was smart,"" recalls Jeff. ""He was interested in the same ideas I was interested in."" Pretty soon the pair spoke daily, sometime for hours at a time. Gradually conversation drifted into Jeff's personal life. Relationship troubles. His past. His insecurities. The honesty seemed to help Jeff focus.   ""It was brilliant at first,"" Jeff says of these early sessions. He soon paid £10,000 for a year-long mentoring course to help improve his discipline. ""I was motivated. I was inspired."" After several months, Jai Singh offered Jeff the chance to get more involved with Lighthouse. Jeff was delighted, even if it did cost him £25,000.  It was a lot of money, but Jai had warned the price would soon go up further if he delayed this decision. And besides, Jeff was told he would make the money back with all the new business opportunities that would surely follow. ""He said it would be the best opportunity for me to succeed,"" says Jeff. Jeff became something called a ""Lighthouse Associate Elect"". It meant he could tap into Lighthouse's network of brilliant entrepreneurs - sitting in on their daily meetings and even training to be a mentor himself.   He would also get guidance from Lighthouse boss Paul Waugh. Jai said Paul counted Bill Gates and Warren Buffett among his contacts.  Jeff handed over the money, and Lighthouse began to take over his life. A Very British Cult Catrin Nye investigates a life coaching company that takes over your life. As the story hots up, they fight back, and there's a surreal final showdown. Watch now on BBC iPlayer (UK Only)  Or listen to the podcast through BBC Sounds Every morning at five, Jeff would prepare for a daily call where Lighthouse business would be discussed. Initially it was just a catch-up. But within six months the calls sprawled to five or six hours long with up to 30 people online.  Jeff shut himself in a room deep in concentration, eyes locked on his laptop - following a peculiar ritual of transcribing Paul Waugh's thoughts and ideas. The schedule, often running from 05:00 to 22:00, was relentless with little time off. But these calls weren't what Jeff had signed up for.  Call transcripts seen by the BBC reveal little of the expected talk of self-help, networking and business success. They recorded something quite different. Perhaps the most important idea in Lighthouse is something called ""the levels"". Paul Waugh - borrowing ideas of a famous American psychiatrist called M Scott Peck - says everyone falls into one of four levels of spiritual development.  Level one is a ""chaotic, childlike"" state - while level four is a conscious and present person, free of constraints and fear. The key to success, explained Paul in his calls, was to get to level four. Jeff was told he needed weeks of work to get there and achieve his goals. But weeks became months, and months became a year.  When Jeff got frustrated on one call, Jai Singh told him to up his efforts and stop being emotionally ""lazy"".  In fact, only one person in Lighthouse was a level four - and that was Paul Waugh himself.  Everyone else was stuck at level one. And the main reason for that, the Lighthouse founder said, was the negative influences around them. (Paul has since said a handful of other Lighthouse ""seniors"" have finally reached level four after more than a decade with the group). Lighthouse also pushes the idea that the greatest obstacle to climbing the levels is often a person's family and friends.  ""All families have difficulties and Lighthouse would find them,"" says Jeff. ""Find them in your journal or find them in your personal mentoring."" Families, said Lighthouse to Jeff, were narcissistic and controlling. Including his own. They didn't want to let their loved ones go and they would sabotage mentees' potential, Jeff was told. They were dangerous. Erin, who became a Lighthouse Associate Elect at the same time as Jeff, tells a similar story. She joined after a divorce, hoping to kick-start a new career - and at first it seemed like a decent way to do it.  ""An investment in herself"", the group called it. But talk of business opportunities turned into revisiting her difficult past.  Erin, whose name we have changed, told her mentor that when she was about 13 she had been sexually abused by someone known to her family.  Lighthouse wanted her to take her parents to court and ""make them pay for not taking better care of her"". Erin now believes it was to free up more money, which she could then invest in Lighthouse.  ""Why aren't you taking it out on them?"" Paul Waugh said on one call to her. ""Why aren't you trying to get justice there?""  We've now spoken to 20 people who've left Lighthouse. A similar pattern has emerged. People join a mentoring group, usually looking for a career change or new direction. Things start off well - and happy mentees invest more money.  But before long, it drifts into endless introspection about troubled backgrounds and awkward families - who mentees are encouraged to think of as ""toxic"" influences to avoid. Life coaching is not a regulated industry with strict professional codes like psychotherapy. And, while there are qualifications available, anyone can claim to be a life coach - thousands do.  Paul Waugh said: ""What qualifies us is experience. Mentoring isn't a qualification, it's an experiential thing."" But coaching in the wrong hands can be dangerous. Before he joined Lighthouse, 30-year-old Anthony Church had struggled with anxiety and depression, suffered a breakdown and attempted suicide.  Early mentoring sessions with Jai Singh seemed to help, and he eventually handed over £5,000 - half his life savings - for more coaching. After a while, Jai encouraged Anthony to reduce his medication, even coaching him on what to tell his doctors to convince them his mental health had improved.  Recordings of calls handed to the BBC reveal Jai telling Anthony that medication ""is not a long-term solution because it doesn't encourage the person to consciously make decisions to command and reprogramme the subconscious mind"".  When a doctor agreed to cut down his dosage, Anthony started complaining of withdrawal symptoms. Jai said it was ""part of the process"".  Caroline Jesper, head of professional standards at the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy, listened to hours of calls between Anthony and Jai and said if any of her members behaved in this way, the association would investigate under its professional conduct procedure. If you have been affected by Lighthouse you can contact Catrin Nye on Twitter @CatrinNye Those who became part of Lighthouse were told slightly different things about what the money they had paid was for. But they were all told their ""investment"" bought them pioneering Lighthouse mentoring which would transform their lives.  Often, they were told they would make their money back quickly through networking opportunities, new business ideas or by becoming mentors themselves. They were also told they were helping to fund Lighthouse's charity work in Africa. Former mentees say they were encouraged to borrow money to pay for courses. Erin says she got a credit card at Jai's suggestion.  To devote himself full-time to Lighthouse, Jeff stopped working and sold his house - ultimately investing £131,000 in the group. But according to the people we spoke to, none of the returns ever materialised. After two years, doubts started to creep in for Jeff. But he knew Lighthouse could be ruthless with dissenters.  When Anthony began querying whether Lighthouse was helping him, Jai said he was being paranoid as a result of withdrawal symptoms from his medication. When he left and sent other Lighthouse mentees information about cults, Jai threatened to call the police.  And when another former mentee, a teacher in her 50s named Jo, discussed her experience on an online forum, a senior Lighthouse member contacted her school and said she was a danger to children. Erin, meanwhile, was berated as a ""cynical old witch"" when she asked where her money had gone. Paul reminded her they had recordings of her disclosures about the abuse she'd suffered as a child.  ""I started to become increasingly unwell,"" says Erin. ""I'd even physically throw up.""  And when she did eventually leave, Paul made good on his threats in a YouTube video, where he named Erin.  He later edited her name out after being warned that identifying a victim of a sexual offence without their consent was a criminal offence. The turning point for Jeff was when he took time off to visit his dad in the US. Away from Lighthouse, he began to see things differently.  He recalled playing golf with Paul Waugh and watching a senior mentor scurrying after him carrying his equipment. At one point, the senior mentor dropped to his knees to tie Paul's undone shoelace. ""I thought, is that where I'm going?"" says Jeff. ""I realised the level of control he had over these people."" When Jeff returned and announced he was quitting, Paul Waugh bombarded him with messages, some friendly, some hostile, to try to get him to stay. Lighthouse told him to wait two years for any return on his money and warned him that creating controversy could jeopardise his investment. Jeff asked for a refund, and the group responded by saying it would be ""stepping up"" investigations into Jeff and his girlfriend Dawn. In the end Lighthouse contacted Dawn's employers and claimed she was a dangerous internet bully. Attacking critics seems to be part of the group's modus operandi. When we put our allegations to Paul Waugh and Lighthouse, the group claimed data protection rules prevented them from responding properly.  It accused the BBC of being part of a smear campaign, and went on to target online people who it suspected we had interviewed, including Jeff and Dawn.  Seven Lighthouse-related accounts were shut down by Twitter for hateful conduct shortly after we first got in touch with Paul Waugh, including one named ""Parents Against Trolls"". More than 40 people who have left Lighthouse, or have loved ones in the group, or have been close to its leader, spoke to the BBC for this story. Many others were too scared to speak. Yet there are still dozens of people who remain part of Lighthouse today. And for many of them, Paul Waugh's promised high life remains out of reach. ""I was able to walk away, but I don't think a lot of people in there have anything to walk to,"" says Jeff. ""They've committed too much."" One woman who rented a six-bedroom house to Paul Waugh, said she ended up with eight Lighthouse team members living there. The house became ""absolutely filthy"" and every bedroom had been converted into a bedsit.  For a time, after they all moved out, three or four letters arrived daily about unpaid bills.  Another ex-landlord told us he had received about 150 letters from debt collection agencies addressed to people involved in Lighthouse.   The BBC searched public records and found 17 county court judgements against nine current members of Lighthouse. Jai Singh, Jeff's mentor, had £20,000 worth of unpaid debts. Paul Waugh had no county court judgements against him. Nearly all those who've been part of Lighthouse have told us they think Lighthouse is a cult. Everyone we spoke to with family members involved in Lighthouse think the same. And Lighthouse is a growing concern to the people who monitor cults too. We spoke to 10 different cult experts from the UK, US and Canada. Among them are five people with PhDs, two winners of the Margaret Singer Award for cultic studies and three accredited therapists with extensive experience working with ex-cult members.  Seven of these experts told us they believe Lighthouse is a cult. Two preferred a different terminology - although both said they were concerned about Lighthouse. The final expert said they would rather not comment. One charity which helps people break free from abusive groups, Catalyst, says it now receives more calls about Lighthouse than any other UK organisation, with ""over thirty"" people asking for help. Sitting on day-long mentoring phone calls seems a far cry from the popular image of a cult - where depictions tend to be about mysticism and new religions.  But the experts say cults are opportunistic, latching on to new trends, even if that is self-help for entrepreneurs. They are defined by how they can control members' money, time and even thoughts. Cult expert and social psychologist Dr Alexandra Stein says: ""There's a such a strong stereotype that the only cults are in California where people wear long orange robes. There is a cult in your neighbourhood."" She says for people with loved ones inside a cult, ""it's like a living death"" - partly because attempts to criticise the group often backfire, leaving them unsure how to act.  Cults want families to get angry and complain, so the family needs to avoid criticism, stay in touch and be available, Stein advises. She accepts it can be extremely challenging.  Karina Deichler, whose brother Kris has been part of Lighthouse for more than a decade, says when they were younger the pair were more like best friends than siblings.  But last year, when Karina wrote about her concerns about Lighthouse online, Kris reported her to the police for being an internet troll. The police took no action.  ""It's just crazy,"" Karina says. ""I just feel numb now. I'd so love to have him back"".  In February this year, the UK government made an application for the firm behind Lighthouse - Lighthouse International Group Holdings Trading LLP - to be closed down. After investigating it since June 2022, the business secretary argued the company was working against the public interest. According to court filings presented by government investigators, Lighthouse was not keeping proper records and was not co-operating with their investigation - which meant it was impossible to determine the ""true nature"" of the business.  Paul Waugh failed to attend at least five scheduled interviews, and even told investigators he was not going to help them.  It was found that between March 2018 and July 2022 about £1.2m was paid to Paul Waugh himself - roughly half the firm's income. The company also did not appear to pay tax or any ordinary business expenses, such as rent or utilities. Paul Waugh argues he receives more than half the money because he pays for some of Lighthouse's expenses himself and is the biggest investor in the people at Lighthouse. On 28 March this year, there was a hearing at the Royal Courts of Justice in London attended by around 20 Lighthouse associates and mentees, including Paul Waugh.  Government investigators told the court that it was ""wholly unclear"" what Lighthouse actually does. Despite the claims of pioneering research, they could ""only identify significant amounts of money passing to Paul Waugh as its prime mover"".  Judge Cheryl Jones decided it was in the public interest to close down Lighthouse International Group Holdings Trading LLP. As he left the courtroom, Paul Waugh told us he had wanted to close Lighthouse down for a while -  but that the group would not be stopping its work. It was now going global.  When asked why so many people think his group is a cult, he said: ""They don't know what a cult is… they're slurring us, they're smearing us."" He added that most of our allegations ""were absolute nonsense"". He later posted online that he was working on a documentary called ""A Very British Broadcasting Cult"" - knowing our podcast series is titled A Very British Cult - which would investigate ""Catrin Nye's sinister cover up attempt"". Lighthouse argues it has helped lots of people overcome obstacles to their potential through mentoring, life-coaching, counselling and community support. It also says people who have given money were investing in themselves and are not entitled to refunds. Although Lighthouse International Group Holdings is now in receivership, there is little to stop the people behind it carrying on its work.  The group is already evolving. Since it came under scrutiny, it has started to rebrand with a new emphasis on Christianity rather than self-help.  Its website says it now trades as ""Lighthouse Global"", which promises to share ""our 18 year journey from personal development into Christ and the persecution we have suffered along the way"". Jeff doesn't expect those still involved will think any differently after the court case. ""They're thinking 'I've got to protect Lighthouse, I've got to protect Paul Waugh.' Logic is gone.""  The day after his firm was shut down by a judge, Paul Waugh went on Twitter. ""I asked the judge to close our old company down,"" he wrote, triumphantly. ""It was a master stroke"" replied one of his followers. Reporting team: Osman Iqbal, Ed Main, Jo Adnitt, Aisha Doherty and Thanduxolo Jika.

Government Securities Yield,iPhone maker halts work over Shanghai lockdown,2024-09-14,2022-04-13,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-61089733,"A major producer of Apple's iPhone has become the latest manufacturer to halt operations because of the lockdown in Shanghai. Technology company Pegatron says it has temporarily suspended production at two of its factories in China. The announcement came even as authorities eased some of Shanghai's coronavirus regulations on Tuesday. It means that some of the city's 25 million people are able to leave their homes for the first time in weeks. The city was locked down in late March after infections surged in the key manufacturing and financial hub. In a stock exchange filing Pegatron said it had halted operations at its factories in Shanghai and nearby Kunshan ""in response to Covid-19 prevention requirements from local government"". The company said it would work with authorities ""to resume the operations as soon as possible"".  Major Apple MacBook manufacturer Quanta, and iPad maker Compal Electronics, have also paused activities in Chinese cities, according to Japanese newspaper Nikkei. Pegatron did not give any further details when contacted for comment by the BBC. Apple, Quanta and Compal did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Dan Ives, an analyst at investment firm Wedbush Securities, said he expected the shutdowns to have an impact on production.  He estimated that the production of 3 million iPhones has been affected so far this month, ""with more to come if this continues"". Mr Ives also told the BBC that production of 2 million iPads and 1 million MacBooks may also be affected. ""The Pegatron closures throw gasoline on the raging fire which is the supply chain for Apple and other parts of the iPhone ecosystem,"" he said. ""This amplifies supply chain issues for iPhones."" Another Taiwanese company Foxconn, which also assembles iPhones for Apple, halted operations at its factory in Shenzhen last month.  It shifted production to other manufacturing sites, while resuming operations in Shenzhen with employees working in a closed loop system, which saw staff living and working at the plant. Since the pandemic began in 2019, China has enforced shutdowns affecting millions of people in major cities including Xi'an and Wuhan. The lockdown of Shanghai is the largest to date and the city is a key centre for the financial industry, manufacturing and home to the world's biggest port."
Government Securities Yield,Can Fed chief dig himself out of a (Jackson) Hole?,2024-09-14,2019-08-22,By Russell Hotten,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-49415776,"Jerome Powell may be ""clueless"" according to US President Donald Trump. But when the Federal Reserve head takes centre stage at a gathering of the banking elite this weekend there'll be plenty of people watching for his clues on restoring global economic balance. It's the annual symposium of central bankers from around the world, held in the picturesque Wyoming mountain village of Jackson Hole. Mr Powell's keynote speech is the much-anticipated highlight. According to Sarah House, senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities: ""The whole point [of Jackson Hole] is to get away, take a step back from what we are currently seeing in the economy, and talk about some of the longer term issues."" But will Mr Powell have that luxury? Such is the anxiety gripping financial markets, there's an expectation he needs to address immediate issues: interest rate direction, conflicting signals on Wall Street, the China trade row, stimulus, perhaps even Mr Trump's constant sniping. Mr Powell faces a balancing act: Calm jittery financial markets without antagonising further a hostile president who only this week called him a ""golfer who can't putt"". Many think it's a no-win situation. For Ms House, it's not even as if the US economy is in particularly bad shape. She told the BBC that Mr Trump perhaps has a point when he insists in his Twitter outpourings that the economy is in rude health.  She said: ""The consumer sector is very strong right now. The labour market is hot - we've got close to the lowest unemployment rate in about 50 years… Savings rates are quite high."" Should the economy turn sour, ""there's a lot of cushion to fall back on"". It's in China and Europe, specifically Germany, where many of the big economic problems lay, she said. And yet, there are fears the US economy, which has expanded each year for more than a decade, is at risk of stalling - perhaps even tipping into recession. Such is Wall Street's unease that share markets plunged 3% one day last week, only to recover almost as quickly. But it is in the bond markets - basically, the area that deals with loans to governments and companies - where recession signals have been flashing brightest.  This month it became more expensive for the US government to borrow money over two years than 10. Usually, investors want a higher rate of return for locking up money for 10 years - compensation for unforeseeable risks. When the reverse is the case - a so-called bond yield inversion - it suggests investors think the short-term economic picture is gloomy. What's more, an inversion has proved a reliable (though by no means conclusive) indicator that recession is on its way. The president has dismissed recession warnings. Yet on Tuesday, he touted tax cuts to boost the economy - only to dismiss the idea on Wednesday. Many asked, if Mr Trump thinks the economy is in good health, why contemplate a tax stimulus? There is, then, a mass of conflicting signals that analysts would like Mr Powell to cut through and clear up.  As Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell points out, when the jobs and consumer markets are healthy, you would normally expect pressure for interest rate rises, not cuts. It's ""just a little odd"", he told the BBC.  Minutes released this week from the last Fed meeting, in July, underlined the confusion. Rates were cut 25 basis points, but the minutes show some policymakers wanted to go further, while others were against a cut. At the very least, the Jackson Hole elite should ""send a signal to markets that they are attuned to the risks and at least doing what they can"", Mr Mould said. A big problem for the Fed chief, however, is that Mr Trump has painted him as an economic threat, and few people have come to the central banker's support. Populists side with the president, while Democrats and progressives think the Fed is just out to protect Wall Street and don't want to be seen as defenders. Karen Petrou, managing partner of Federal Financial Analytics, says Mr Trump has set up Mr Powell for blame if, or when, things go wrong. For all the president's contradictions, he's a master of political reality, she says. ""Mr Trump doesn't care what rates are. He cares about who voters think is to blame for slower growth and market turmoil, and he is determined to be sure it isn't him,"" she said. ""What's an astute politician to do? Find a fall guy distrusted by Republicans, Democrats, independents, populists, and progressives."" Some experts think it's time Mr Powell gave a more forceful response to pressure coming from the White House. Central bankers have emerged from the shadows since the global financial crisis, to be seen as economic saviours with a more powerful public voice. Joseph Song, senior economist at Bank of America, thinks Mr Powell and other Fed policymakers will at the very least defend the Fed's independence. ""They are going to try to hammer home that message again and again, and make sure that they preserve their independence,"" he told the BBC. But the Fed's task is pretty straightforward (if difficult): keep the labour market strong without causing inflation. It means the central bank alone cannot deliver what Mr Trump ultimately wants - sustained economic growth and financial stability - and Mr Powell should perhaps stand up and say so, says Mohamed El-Erian, former head of bond trading giant Pimco. But, as Mr El-Erian wrote this week in an article for Bloomberg, any push back against the president ""risks fuelling immediate market instability and aggravating White House anger"". Perhaps it would be better to say nothing at all, he ponders. ""No wonder a growing number of observers wonder whether central banks should revisit the mantra that more communication and policy transparency are always better - a traditional wisdom that led Powell to increase the frequency of press conferences,"" he said. But after all the expectation, if the Fed chief does opt for diplomacy and prudence, it could end up making Jackson Hole something an anti-climax."
Government Securities Yield,Debt fears over India borrowing move,2024-09-14,2019-07-17,By Vivek Kaul,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-48960315,"While presenting her maiden annual budget on 5 July, India's first full-time female finance minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, indicated that her government was planning to borrow more money from abroad. The reason, she said, was that the ratio of India's sovereign external debt to gross domestic product (GDP) is among the lowest in the world - less than 5%. Like most countries, India runs a fiscal deficit, which means that it spends more than it earns, and has to borrow money to make up for the difference.  In 2019-20, the government is expected to run a fiscal deficit of about $103bn (£82bn), or about 3.3% of GDP.  Typically, the government would have borrowed domestically. The problem is that the federal government is not the only one borrowing money.  India's state governments also run their own fiscal deficits and need to borrow money in order to make up for the difference. Then there are state-owned companies which also borrow heavily. Meanwhile, the household savings - bank deposits, insurance funds, mutual funds, currency - which finance these borrowings have been declining over the years.  This has led to a situation where interest rates remain high, despite inflation coming down and the central bank cutting its repo rate three times this year. (The repo rate is the interest rate at which the central bank lends to commercial banks). All the borrowing by the government and its companies - which amounts to 8.5% of GDP - has meant there is less money for private companies to borrow.  Finance Secretary Subhash Chandra Garg has indicated the central government will borrow $10bn from overseas during this financial year. The theory is that by borrowing abroad, the government won't be putting pressure on Indian savings, like it has in recent years.   And there will be less crowding out of private companies looking to borrow and, in the process, slightly lower interest rates.  This is important because private investment in India has been down in the dumps for the last few years.  The major reason is that many private companies went on a borrowing binge between 2004 and 2011, and have since found it difficult to repay the loans, primarily to India's state-owned banks. Banks, in turn, don't want to lend to companies. Many economists and bureaucrats believe that high interest rates are also holding private investment back.  But the government can borrow money and lower interest rates another way too.  It just needs to expand the limits it has set on foreign investors investing in India's debt market - government or corporate bonds, for example.  Allowing more foreign money here will mean less pressure on India's domestic savings. That will lead to lower interest rates, without having to borrow money from abroad.   And instead of repaying the loan in dollars or any other foreign currency, the government will have to repay the loan in rupees, which as we shall see, makes immense sense. Currency risk Borrowing in dollars is expected to be cheaper, and hence, bring down the interest that the government pays on its debt.  But this comes with a corollary.  Assuming the borrowing is in US dollars, the rupee is likely to depreciate against the dollar in the long-term given that India's inflation is significantly higher than that of the US. Then the lower interest rate cost will be more than made up for by the government needing more rupees to buy dollars to repay the loan as well as pay interest on it. So, not everyone is happy with the decision of the government to borrow abroad.  There are also other negatives that come attached with any country borrowing abroad. First and foremost, it will lead to the rupee appreciating against the dollar, at least in the short-run.  When the bonds are sold and the dollars (or any other foreign currency for that matter) are brought back to India, they will have to be converted into rupees.  This will push up the demand for rupees and eventually lead to the rupee appreciating in value against the dollar. In the short-term, an appreciating rupee will hurt India's exports, which are struggling already.  It will also make imports cheaper and hurt domestic producers competing against them.  In the recent past, India has gone back to a policy of protectionism. Hence, there is a lack of policy consistency here as far as the government is concerned.  And some economists are also worried about the currency risk that accompanies any foreign borrowing. When a government borrows in the domestic currency - like the Indian government borrowing in rupees - it always has the option of printing currency and repaying the debt - or what economists call inflating the debt away.  That option doesn't exist when the borrowing is not in the domestic currency. India's central bank cannot create dollars out of thin air. It can only print rupees.  As former finance minister Arun Jaitley wrote in an official paper on government debt last year, ""Public debt is predominantly of domestic origin and denominated in domestic currency, insulating the debt portfolio from currency risk."" In fact, many countries have faced financial crises in the past because of their inability to repay money borrowed in a foreign currency. Latin American countries like Argentina, Brazil and Mexico are a good example; and something similar also played out in Indonesia and Thailand in the late 1990s.  This possibility has some economists worried.  But currency risk becomes a worry only when the foreign borrowings of the government reach a certain size.  Foreign borrowing of $10bn shouldn't lead to any worries on the currency risk front, especially since India's foreign exchange reserves, as of June 2019, stood at $428bn. Having said that, the government shouldn't get used to the idea of borrowing from abroad.  History shows that it's easy for governments to get addicted to foreign debt, which seems cheaper in the short-term. Given that we live in an era of easy money, if the Indian government wants to borrow, money will be easily available to it. This could cause a few problems.  One, it will increase the currency risk.  And two, given the fact that Indian economic statistics have been questioned in the recent past, any international crisis can have a disproportionate impact on India, even if the international borrowings are not huge.

Government Securities Yield,Zoom sees sales boom amid pandemic,2024-09-14,2020-06-02,By Natalie Sherman,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-52884782,"When it comes to its growth rate, video conference company Zoom has lived up to its name. Use of the firm's software jumped 30-fold in April, as the coronavirus pandemic forced millions to work, learn and socialise remotely. At its peak, the firm counted more than 300 million daily participants in virtual meetings, while paying customers have more than tripled. The dramatic uptake has the potential to change the firm's path. Zoom said it expects sales as high as $1.8bn (£1.4bn) this year - roughly double what it forecast in March. ""It's a huge opportunity,"" chief executive Eric Yuan told investors on Tuesday. Mr Yuan didn't intend to create Zoom for the masses. A Chinese-born software engineer, Mr Yuan started the company in 2011, after years rising through the ranks at WebEx, one of the first US video conference companies, which was purchased by Cisco in 2007 for $3.2bn. At the time, he faced doubts from many investors, who did not see the need for another option in a market already dominated by big players such as Microsoft and Cisco. But Mr Yuan - who has credited his interest in video conferencing to the long distances he had to travel to meet up with his now-wife in their youth - was frustrated at Cisco and believed there was demand in the business world for software that would work on mobile phones and be easier to use. When the firm sold its first shares to the public last year, it was valued at $15.9bn. That shot to more than $58bn on Tuesday. ""What Zoom has done is kind of democratised video conferencing for all kinds of businesses and made it very simple for everyone from yoga instructors through to board room executives to deploy video,"" says Alex Smith, senior director at Canalys. When the lockdowns started, Zoom lifted the limits for the free version of its software in China and for educators in many countries, including the UK, helping to drive its popularity. But the firm's bread and butter customers are corporate clients, who pay for subscriptions and enhanced features. Zoom said on Tuesday that sales jumped 169% year-on-year in the three months to 30 April to $328.2m, as it added more than 180,000 customers with more than 10 employees since January - far more than it had expected. It also turned a profit of $27m in the quarter - more than it made in all of the prior financial year. The massive uptake has also strained the firm, forcing it to invest to expand capacity to meet the needs of new users, many of whom are not paying customers. Its reputation also took a hit, as the new attention prompted hackers to hijack meetings and exposed a host of security flaws, revealing that the firm had sent user data to Facebook, had wrongly claimed the app had end-to-end encryption, and was allowing meeting hosts to track attendees. It has also faced political scrutiny for its ties to China - where it has more than 700 staff, including most of its product development team - which have prompted warnings that it is not fit for government use.  In April, Mr Yuan, who is a US citizen, apologised for the security lapses and the firm started rolling out a number of changes intended to fix the problems. Zoom has also announced a number of new appointments familiar with Washington politics, including H R McMaster, a retired Army general and former national security adviser to Donald Trump.  ""Navigating this process has been a humbling learning experience,"" Mr Yuan said on an investor call on Tuesday. Analysts said they expected the company would overcome these reputational blows. ""It's had that mishap and the fact that its name is still very much used as verbatim with video technology still gives it a lot of momentum and opportunity to continue,"" Mr Smith said. Analysts say they expect Zoom to maintain its focus on business customers, since that's how it makes money. But the pandemic is likely to create more challenges for Zoom in that market, as increased demand for remote work prompts competitors such as Microsoft and Cisco to pour resources into the field. ""The stakes are higher and the competition's getting tougher, so we'll see,"" says Ryan Koontz, managing director at Rosenblatt Securities. ""They were on a very strong trajectory before... and happened to be in the right place at the right time as the whole world decided we needed to communicate well on video,"" he says. ""They have this amazing brand... now they have to leverage that brand and figure out which markets they're going to go after."""
Government Securities Yield,Nvidia must halt China AI chip sales 'immediately',2024-09-14,2023-10-25,By Peter Hoskins,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-67213134,"Tech giant Nvidia says the US has told it to stop shipping some of its advanced artificial intelligence chips to China immediately.  The restrictions were supposed to be introduced 30 days from 17 October. That was when President Joe Biden's administration announced measures to block countries, including China, Iran and Russia, from buying high-end AI chips designed by Nvidia and others. Nvidia did not say why the timeline had been moved forward. In a statement to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Nvidia said the US government said these curbs were ""effective immediately"", but added that ""given the strength of demand for the Company's products worldwide, the Company does not anticipate that the accelerated timing of the licensing requirements will have a near-term meaningful impact on its financial results"".  The new restrictions bar exports of Nvidia's advanced AI chips, which had been designed for the Chinese market to comply with earlier export regulations. The acceleration of the introduction of the US curbs is the latest move in the ongoing technology dispute between Washington and Beijing. Chinese authorities have yet to publicly comment on Nvidia's announcement, but it hit back at the Biden administration's decision to impose new restrictions on advanced chip exports when it was announced last week. The country's foreign ministry said the curbs ""violate the principles of the market economy and fair competition"". The move was seen as an attempt to close loopholes that became apparent after an initial wave of chip controls last October. At the time, the US said the measures were designed to prevent China from receiving cutting-edge technologies that it could use to strengthen its military, especially in the field of AI. Soaring demand for Nvidia's AI chips has pushed up its share price more than threefold, making it one of the most valuable companies in the world. In May the firm joined technology giants Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Microsoft in the elite club of companies with stock market valuations of more than $1 trillion (£822bn). California-based Nvidia has come to dominate the market for chips used in AI systems. Chip giant Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), which also supplies AI chips to China, has not made any announcement about the accelerated export curbs. It did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment. The US Department of Commerce declined to comment on Nvidia's statement when contacted by the BBC."
Government Securities Yield,'There were no women in my field so I found my own way',2024-09-14,2022-09-04,By Mariko Oi,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-62719779,"Believed to have started in 869AD, the Gion Matsuri is one of the most famous annual festivals in Japan. This year it embraced the digital world. For the 2022 event back in July, an interactive, online map was made available to show where and when to see the 34 huge, ornate floats that paraded across the city of Kyoto over two separate days. Using GPS, it showed the location of each float. And you could also use the map to find your friends and chat with them. In addition, if you clicked on a building or street, you could read about its history in Japanese or English. The person behind the technology is Machi Takahashi, the president and co-chief executive of Kyoto-based, digital map firm Stroly. A mother of two, she is a rare female entrepreneur in a country where the start-up scene is still very much dominated by men. ""I was surprised that [the festival organisers] would let us digitise their map, because I thought these traditional cultural festivals are quite conservative,"" she says. The website-based digital map is accessed by scanning a QR code. Hideo Yoshii, who is in charge of looking after one of the biggest floats, says that Stroly may have gotten some pushback if it had just wanted to put QR code stickers or signs up on walls. Instead Stroly created a pretty postcard that had not just the QR code printed on it, but also the pattern of a traditional Japanese map. This complemented the atmosphere of the ancient event, and was also used as the design for the digital map Stroly made. ""Before the pandemic, we gave out a pamphlet, but tourists found it difficult to navigate the city,"" says a spokeswoman for the city's tourism department. ""By using Stroly's digital map, police officers who are on the ground found it much easier to explain to visitors where to go. We've also managed to reduce our paper waste by a third,"" she adds.  The idea to set up a business making digital maps came to Ms Takahashi and her husband and co-founder Toru while they were both still working at Kyoto-based technology research institute ATR. He is Stroly's chairman and co-chief executive.  One of their first customers was the movie industry theme park Toei Kyoto Studio Park back in 2010. ""We asked Mr and Ms Takahashi to create a game using Nintendo DS,"" says Norihiro Yamaguchi, who was the boss of Toei Kyoto Studio Park at the time. New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape. The map and GPS-based game that the Takahashis produced involved the park's visitors having to locate seven actors playing screen villains. Six years later, the Takahashis left the research institute to set up Stroly as their own business, with the theme park remaining one of its main clients.  ""Thanks to smartphones which allow users to access the Stroly map in different languages, visitors can find out about the details of our shows and facilities,"" says a spokesman for the park. Stroly has now produced almost 10,000 interactive, digital maps, including one highlighting the vibrant nightlife of the busy Shinjuku area of central Tokyo. That was commissioned by the government of the capital city. Other maps include where to find the best cheese in the Tokachi dairy farming region of Hokkaido, Japan's northernmost main island, as well as work for clients outside Japan. For members of the public Stroly's maps are free to use. It instead makes its money by charging its customers, mostly in tourism and transport, annual subscriptions. ""When I started thinking about starting my own business in 2015, there was no woman in this information technology field so I had to find my way into this community,"" says Ms Takahashi. ""I had to actually contact [US-based Japanese entrepreneur] Ari Horie from Women's Startup Lab in Silicon Valley, instead of [anyone] in Japan, to help me out."" Stroly was subsequently selected as one of the first start-ups to be given mentoring by a new regional business support agency called Osaka Innovation Hub. This was where Ms Takahashi managed to secure funding from Japanese investment bank Daiwa Securities. The firm also later received money from Kyoto City's start-up fund. The difficulty faced by female entrepreneurs is not unique to Japan. Even in the US, only 2% of venture capital, which invests in new start-ups, went to women last year. In an article for Vogue magazine last month where she announced that she was ""evolving away from tennis"", US sports star Serena Williams said this was part of the reason she launched her own investment fund, Serena Ventures. ""Sometimes like attracts like,"" wrote Williams. ""Men are writing those big cheques to one another, and in order for us to change that, more people who look like me need to be in that position, giving money back to themselves."" Ms Takahashi agrees. ""The decision-making roles are also mostly [held by] men. I think they simply cannot relate to the problems and issues addressed by women entrepreneurs,"" she says. The Japanese government had wanted to use the five years from 2015 to 2020 to almost triple the proportion of female managers in the country to reach 30% of the total. However, the current level is just 15%, compared with the global average of 31%. And according to the country's Financial Services Agency, less than 1% of Japanese venture capital firms are run by women. Kathy Matsui leads one such firm, MPower Partners, which she recently started in Tokyo with two female partners, Yumiko Murakami and Seki Miwa. A former vice chair of investment bank Goldman Sachs Japan, Ms Matsui is best known for her ""womenomics"" drive since the 1990s, which has encouraged the Japanese government to improve its gender ratio among businesses.  ""I would say the vast majority of entrepreneurs and founders we've met so far, here in Japan, are male,"" she says. ""But when we think about start-ups, they're trying to use innovation to create disruptive businesses, life-changing technologies. And if you're excluding half the population from your potential talent pool as a start-up, you're already trying to win a marathon on one leg rather than two."" Back in Kyoto, Ms Takahashi's success in finding a gap in the digital tourism market may be an exception to the male-dominated rule. There is no denying that it is still an uphill battle to create a greater equal footing in Japan's workforce. So does she have any advice for younger entrepreneurs, and particularly female ones?  ""Jump into the ecosystem,"" she says. ""It is very easy to get to know someone in the field, and once you know somebody, it's a great network that you need to expand your business.""

Government Securities Yield,Viewpoint: How serious is India's economic slowdown?,2024-09-14,2019-08-27,By Praveen  Chakravarty,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-49470466,"Top Indian government officials are engaged in a vociferous public debate over the state of the country's economy. Rajiv Kumar, the head of the government's think tank Niti Aayog, recently claimed that the current slowdown was unprecedented in 70 years of independent India and called for immediate policy interventions in specific industries.  The Chief Economic Adviser, K Subramanian, disagreed with the idea of industry-specific incentives and argued for structural reforms in land and labour markets. Members of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's economic advisory council sound inchoate, resorting to social media and opinion editorials to counter one another.  In essence, the quibble among the members of the economic team of Mr Modi and his government is not about whether India is facing an economic slowdown or not, but about how grave the current economic crisis is.  This is a remarkable reversal in stance of the same group of economists who, until a few months ago, waxed eloquent about how India was the fastest growing economy in the world, generating seven million jobs a year. To put all this in context, it was less than just two years ago, in November 2017, that the global ratings agency Moody's upgraded India's sovereign ratings - an independent assessment of the creditworthiness of a country - for the first time in 14 years.  Justifying the upgrade, Moody's had then argued that the economy was undergoing dramatic ""structural"" reforms under Mr Modi.  In the two years since, Moody's has downgraded its 2019 GDP growth forecast for India thrice - from 7.5% to 7.4% to 6.8% to 6.2%.  The immediate questions that arise now are: is India's economic condition really that grim and, if yes, how did it deteriorate so rapidly? One of India's most celebrated entrepreneurs, the founder of the largest coffee store chain, Café Coffee Day, recently killed himself, ostensibly due to unmanageable debt, slowing growth and alleged harassment by tax authorities.  The auto industry is expected to shed close to a million direct and indirect jobs due to a decline in vehicle sales. Sales growth of men's inner wear clothing, a key barometer of consumption popularised by former Federal Reserve Chair Alan Greenspan, is negative. Consumption demand that accounts for two-thirds of India's GDP is fast losing steam. To make matters worse, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman presented her first budget recently with some ominous tax proposals that threatened foreign capital flows and dented investor confidence. It sparked criticism and Ms Sitharaman was forced to roll back many of her proposals. So, it is indeed true that India is facing a sharp economic downturn and severe loss of business confidence.  The alarm over the economic condition is not merely a reflection of a slowdown in GDP growth but also the poor quality of growth.  Private sector investment, the mainstay of sustainable growth in any economy, is at a 15-year low.  In other words, there is almost no investment in new projects by the private sector. The situation is so bad that many Indian industrialists have complained loudly about the state of the economy, the distrust of the government towards businesses and harassment by tax authorities. But India's economic slowdown is neither sudden nor a surprise.  Behind the fawning headlines in the press over the past five years about the robustness of India's growth was a vulnerable economy, straddled with massive bad loans in the financial sector, disguised further by a macroeconomic bonanza from low global oil prices.  India's largest import is oil and the fortuitous decline in oil prices between 2014 and 2016 added a full percentage point to headline GDP growth, masking the real problems. Confusing luck with skill, the government was callous about fixing the choked financial system. To make matters worse, Mr Modi embarked on a quixotic move in 2016 to withdraw all high-value banknotes from circulation overnight. This effectively removed 85% of all currency notes from the economy. This move destroyed supply chains and impacted agriculture, construction and manufacturing that together account for three-quarters of all employment in the country.  Before the economy could recover from the currency ban shock, the government enacted a transition to a new indirect taxation system of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) in 2017. The GST rollout wasn't smooth and many small businesses initially struggled to understand it. Such massive external shocks to the economy, coupled with a reversal in low oil prices, dealt the final blow to the economy. Millions of Indians started to lose their jobs and rural wages remained stagnant. This, in turn, impacted consumption, slowing down the economy sharply.  The wobbly state of the economy has also thrown government finances in disarray: tax revenues are much below expectations.  On Monday, the government got a much-needed breather when India's central bank announced a $24bn (£19bn) one-time payout for the cash-starved government. (This amount is more than the dividend paid by the central bank to the government in all five years of the Congress rule between 2009 and 2014.)  The solutions to the economic crisis are not easy.   Indian industry, fed and fattened with government protection through decades, is once again clamouring for tax cuts and financial incentives.  But it is not clear that such benefits will revive private sector investment and domestic consumption immediately.   For all the hype about the Make in India programme, hailed as the harbinger of the country's emergence as a manufacturing power, India's dependence on China for goods has only doubled in the past five years.  India today imports from China the equivalent of 6,000 rupees ($83; £68) worth of goods for every Indian, which has doubled from 3,000 rupees in 2014.  India's exports have remained stuck at 2011 levels and not grown.  So, India is neither making goods for itself nor for the world.  Ornamental tax and other fiscal incentives to specific industries are not suddenly going to make Indian manufacturers competitive and stop India's addiction for affordable Chinese goods. If any, the trade spat between China and the United States only saw countries such as Vietnam and Bangladesh benefit and not India. More currency or trade tariffs are not the solutions either. The central bank has lowered interest rates and there is some push to lowering the cost of capital for industry. But again, Indian industry will invest more only when demand for goods and services increases. And demand will increase only when wages increase, or there is money in the hands of people.  So, the only immediate solution for India seems to be to boost consumption through a stimulus given directly to people, in the classical Keynesian mould.  Of course, such a stimulus should be combined with reforms to boost business morale and confidence. In sum, India's economic picture is not pretty.  It is important for India's political leadership to see this not-so-pretty picture and not hide behind rose tinted glasses. Prime Minister Modi has a unique electoral mandate to embark on bold moves to truly transform the economy and pull India out of the woods.

Government Securities Yield,Week ahead in Parliament,2024-09-14,2019-02-09,By Mark D'Arcy,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-parliaments-47184251,"Parliament's brief respite from Brexit will end this week - and while a major debate is scheduled for Thursday, it is still far from clear how the week's events will unfold.  The thing to look out for is the sudden announcement of a new Business Statement from the Leader of the Commons, Andrea Leadsom, to rejig the parliamentary timetable, should circumstances change in some way.  MPs, and indeed Mr Speaker, would doubtless be very suspicious of any postponement, but it is far from impossible that the debate could be brought forward.  The first unknown is whether the prime minister will have a reversioned exit deal to lay before the House. Few expect she will, having emerged from her latest talks with a promise of more negotiations.  And in the absence of that, the promise is that MPs will have a debate on a neutral motion, to which they can attach amendments. In other words, something very similar in form to the series of votes held on 29 January, which yielded the ""Brady Amendment"" instructing the PM to seek to reshape the Northern Ireland backstop into a form Conservative backbenchers and the DUP could accept.  With uncertainty over the shape of any deal the prime minister may obtain, expect the next crop of amendments to be mostly about process - they may, for example, include a new incarnation of the proposal from Labour MP Yvette Cooper and Tory Nick Boles, to force the government to postpone Brexit Day, if they have no deal by the end of the month.  This was a potent legislative weapon, prioritising a bill which would then have been binding upon the government. It failed then, but, a fortnight closer to Brexit Day and to the prospect of a no-deal exit, a different version, perhaps featuring a shorter postponement, might be a runner.   There may also be some attempt to muster support for a ""soft Brexit"" amendment to push the government towards a customs union-based Brexit - something which many Conservative Brexiteers would be deeply opposed to. At the moment this is all speculation - but watch out for supporters of assorted Brexit schemes breaking cover over the weekend, to announce their pet amendments. Meanwhile there is a fair amount of Brexit business under way. The Lords will be spending much of the coming week hacking their way through dozens of Brexit-related orders and regulations, and there's what amounts to the first no-deal preparatory bill, in the shape of the Financial Services (Implementation of Legislation) Bill  in the Commons. The Commons opens (2.30 pm) with Work and Pensions questions, doubtless to be followed by the usual post-weekend crop of ministerial statements and urgent questions. MPs then turn to the Financial Services (Implementation of Legislation) Bill - a major piece of legislation transposing a huge volume of EU regulations into UK law - it includes so-called ""in-flight files"" which are EU regulations that are not fully solidified into law, at the time of Brexit. The day ends with a particularly interesting adjournment debate, led by the Conservative Craig Mackinlay, on reform of election law.  Last month, Mr Mackinlay was acquitted of charges of overspending in his election campaign in 2017 and says that he has ""extreme concerns as to the clarity of election law, and the glaring grey area between national spending rules (under the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000) and local spending rules (under the Representation of the People Act 1983)""; adding that ""candidates and agents should never have to face the threat of criminal prosecution, with life-changing consequences, in the face of abstract law"".  Intriguingly, he promises to offer ""an elegant solution"". In Westminster Hall the Petitions Committee has scheduled a debate on e-petition 229178 which states that: ""School should start at 10am as teenagers are too tired"". The petition, which has more than 179,000 signatures, states: ""Teenagers are so tired due to having to wake up very early to get to school. The government should require secondary schools to start later, which will lead to increased productivity at school.""  This attracted 90,000 signatures in 19 hours last weekend, making it one of the fastest growing petitions since the e-petitions website opened in 2015. The government have not had time to issue a written response.  My committee pick is the Housing, Communities and Local Government session on local authorities' children's services (4pm).  This features academics and children's charities and will focus on the pressures faced by local authorities' children's services, including the increasing demand for child protection services. In the Lords (2.30 pm) questions to ministers include the Labour peer and refugee campaigner Lord Dubs asking about the number of refugee children who have arrived in the UK from Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey under the Vulnerable Children's Resettlement Scheme which he was instrumental in creating.  Peers then look at Commons amendments to the Crime (Overseas Production Orders) Bill, where the key issue is on evidence in relation to the death penalty in third party countries. The rest of the day is devoted to (count them) nine Statutory Instrument approval motions: two on companies, limited liability partnerships, and on recognition of professional qualifications; and then two (to be taken together) on social security/ National Insurance payments, and on tax credits and Guardian's Allowance. These are followed by four Sis on insolvency and insurance; insurance distribution; financial conglomerates; and Financial Services Contracts. MPs kick off (at 11.30am) with Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy questions.   The day's Ten Minute Rule Bill is the Child Cruelty (Sentences) Bill - the Conservative Tom Tugendhat will be calling an increase in the maximum sentence for child cruelty, prompted by the case of his constituent Tony Hudgell, now four years old. He was beaten so badly by his birth parents (Hudgell is the name of the parents who later adopted him) that he had to have both legs amputated. Mr Tugendhat wants judges to have the option of passing longer sentences than the current ten year maximum, in these very rare cases.  The main event is the detailed report stage consideration of the Mental Capacity (Amendment) Bill, which picks up recommendations from the Law Commission to review the Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards scheme, the procedures under which someone may be deprived of liberty because they lack mental capacity. There are a number of detailed amendments from the government and from Labour clarifying who is responsible for decisions in various circumstances, and an amendment from Labour MPs Chris Bryant and Debbie Abrahams dealing with the effects of the bill on people being treated for brain injuries. The adjournment debate, led by the Labour MP Owen Smith, is on the licensing of medical devices - he aims to highlight what he warns is the weakness of the regulations of medical devices, as shown by successive scandals about surgical mesh, some hip replacements, pace-makers and breast implants.  He says more and more devices are being implanted in people, but with none of the scrutiny that medicines are subject to. He believes they should be tracked and evaluated once on the market - but the companies don't want to bear the cost of post-marketing surveillance. In Westminster Hall (9.30am) the Labour MP Bambos Charalambous leads a debate on missing persons guardianship - he had a constituent whose brother went missing on the Galapagos Islands, whose body was never recovered. She tried to manage his affairs while not being able to produce a body. She found it virtually impossible to do so, because the mortgage lender would not discuss matters with her, and she was not able to cancel direct debits and manage her brother's affairs. Eventually, after a long passage of time, she managed to go down the presumption of death route.  This issue affects many people. A charity called Missing People estimates that more than 1,000 people go missing for over a year every year, where they do not know what has happened to them and have not found a body. These are not just runaways but people who are long-term missing. Their families, as well as having the grief, cannot manage their affairs.  The Guardianship (Missing Persons) Act was passed in April 2017 but has never been implemented, more than two and a half years later. Other debates include the regulation of non-surgical cosmetic procedures, led by the Conservative Alberto Costa (11am);  special educational needs and disabilities funding led by the Lib Dem Leader, Sir Vince Cable (2.30pm); then comes a Brexit-related debate on the seasonal agricultural workers scheme (4pm).  Labour MP Alex Norris wants to highlight the danger that post-Brexit schemes for farm workers might provide an opportunity for modern slavery, and practices like debt bondage and abuse by gangmasters. The Home Secretary Sajid Javid has signalled that he is aware of this issue, and Mr Norris is keen to quiz ministers about their plans.  The final debate (4.30pm) is on support for young carers. Labour MP Paul Blomfield has been pressing ministers to fund local authorities efforts to identify and support carers, particularly so-called 'invisible' carers who are not known to local councils or local groups.  My committee pick is the Welsh Affairs session on the future of the Wylfa Newydd nuclear reactor (2.45pm). Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns and Business Minister Richard Harrington will be quizzed on their next moves after the Japanese nuclear firm, Hitachi, pulled out of the £20bn project with the loss of thousands of jobs. Meanwhile the Transport Committee has its final evidence session on the health of the bus market (9.45am)  with the Buses Minister Nusrat Ghani, who will face questions on what the government is doing to support the industry and reverse the drop in passenger numbers on services outside London. The committee has been out and about investigating conditions in Leicester, Bristol and Liverpool and hearing from passengers, bus companies and local authorities about issues like funding, ticketing and regulation. In the Lords (2.30pm) peers rattle through another job lot of Brexit-related statutory instruments: the Draft Aviation Safety (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019; the Draft Air Passenger Rights and Air Travel Organisers' Licensing (EU Exit) Regulations 2018; the Draft Air Services (Competition) (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 and the Draft Airports Slot Allocation (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 and the Draft Motor Vehicles (Wearing of Seatbelts) (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2018. A busy Commons day opens (11.30am) with half an hour of International Development questions, followed at noon by Prime Minister's Questions.  The day's Ten Minute Rule Bill is proposed by Labour's Matt Western, who wants to limit bus drivers on local routes to driving for no more than 56 hours in any one week and 90 hours in any two consecutive weeks.  And then MPs will deliver their tributes to Sir David Natzler, the Clerk of the Commons, who is retiring after serving as the top advisor to the Speaker and MPs on constitutional and procedural issues.  Guide: The Brexit amendments and results The PM will then update MPs on the progress of Brexit - with a statement which will feed into Thursday's debate on a neutral motion. MPs may also press for the Business of the House motion laying out the parameters for Thursday's debate to be discussed, and possibly amended on Wednesday, well in advance of the actual debate.  The main legislative action is a debate on the Securitisation Regulations 2018 - this is about the new EU regulations on pooling different types of debt like residential or commercial mortgages, car loans or credit card debt obligations and selling the resulting cash flows as securities.  And after that there's a general debate on ""connecting communities by supporting families and volunteers"". The close of business would normally be the deadline for submitting amendments for discussion in Thursday's Brexit debate. In Westminster Hall the opening debate (9.30am) is on the health implications of sunbed use - the Conservative Pauline Latham wants to discuss the dangers from the ultraviolet rays given out by sunbeds, which increase the risk of developing skin cancer, although it can then take up to 20 years to appear. She will quote World Health Organisation advice that sunbeds are as dangerous as smoking and argue for greater safeguards on their use. Other debates include the SNP's Tommy Sheppard on human rights in the UK (2.30pm) and the Conservative Ben Bradley on nurture and alternative provision in primary schools (4.30pm). On the committee corridor, the Women and Equalities Committee have a promising-looking hearing (9.50am) on the use of non-disclosure agreements in discrimination cases, where the focus seems to be on their use by public bodies.  The witnesses are top officials from the House of Commons, including Saira Salimi, the Speaker's Counsel, as well as from the Cabinet Office, the BBC, and several local councils. And the Brexit Committee (9.15am) has a star guest in the form of Bertie Ahern, the former Taioseach of the Republic of Ireland who oversaw the negotiation of the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement. This is part of the committee's continuing inquiry monitoring the progress of the Brexit negotiations - and with the Northern Ireland backstop now such a critical issue, this will doubtless be a significant hearing. In the Lords (3pm) questions to ministers include Lib Dem by-election guru Lord Rennard asking about providing greater clarity on constituency expenditure on behalf of a candidate and national expenditure on behalf of a party - he believes the current law allows almost unlimited 'national' party spending being targeted at individual constituencies. He will be asking ministers to bring forward secondary legislation which would avoid any confusion restore 'level playing field' principles. Then it's back to Brexit, with a government ""take note"" motion on EU withdrawal together plus, on previous form, a Labour amendment which will then be pushed to a vote at the end - expect something which seeks to build on previous resolutions of the Lords by urging the government to avoid a no-deal Brexit. Meanwhile, the week's third batch of orders and regulations will be discussed in the Moses Room (the Lords equivalent of Westminster Hall): the Construction Products (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations; the Storage of Carbon Dioxide (Amendment and Power to Modify) (EU Exit) Regulations; the Ecodesign for Energy-Related Products and Energy Information (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations and the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations.  The Commons opens (9.30am) with Transport questions, followed by questions to the Leader of the House, Andrea Leadsom.  The main debate is on the UK's withdrawal from the EU (see above) and it will probably culminate in a couple of hours of voting on alternative ideas about Brexit.  The timing of these will depend on the Business of the House motion, but expect them in the early evening. A key moment will be the Speaker's selection of the amendments to be discussed.   In Westminster Hall, there's a debate on the effect of Santander branch closures on local communities. In the Lords (11am) the usual half hour of questions to ministers is followed by a another helping of statutory instruments including the Guaranteed Minimum Pensions Increase and compensation payments for Mesothelioma and Pneumoconiosis.  All three of these have already been through the Commons. Then comes the week's fourth batch of Brexit orders and regulations, including the Immigration (Leave to Enter and Remain) (Amendment) Order 2018. There's also a short debate on improving immigration procedures in the UK, led by the Lib Dem, Lord Roberts of Llandudno. Neither House sits on Friday."
Government Securities Yield,'Colossus Lennon reduced to caretaker',2024-09-14,2021-01-22,Tom English,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/55769774,"This video can not be played 'I've been concerned about job for long time' - Lennon Neil Lennon used a lot of words in a lot of different ways over the last week, defensively, conspiratorially and, finally, plaintively. After drawing with Livingston in the snow of the Tony Macaroni Arena on Wednesday, the Celtic manager was asked what has happened to his previously all-conquering players. In that moment, he was lost for an explanation. ""I don't know where they've gone,"" he said meekly.  In a week that brought an incendiary diatribe on Monday - a rant that was light on logic and heavy on victimhood - this was a quieter, more reflective and more sympathetic Lennon. Confused and dejected, it was easier to feel for this version than the desperate character who thundered into a news conference two days before with the intention of going to town on the club's critics but only managed to shine the brightest spotlight on his own insecurities.  Those few words - ""I don't know where they've gone"" - told the story of Celtic's demise better than anything else he has said. There were no answers because he doesn't have any to give. He has theories, shots-in-the-dark explanations, but nothing more.  The dramatic, breakneck speed of Celtic's demise is as much of a mystery to the man at the heart of it as it is to all others watching from the outside.  No crisis but title may be beyond Celtic - Lennon Lennon agenda claim appalling, says Swinney Celtic 'decimated by government rules' - Lennon This is a totemic Celtic man laid low. A player, a captain, a manager, a winner of 10 leagues, eight Scottish Cups, three League Cups, a Uefa Cup finalist on the field, a conqueror of Barcelona off the field. The only person in the club's storied history to win domestic trebles on both sides of the touchline.  History will remember Lennon's contribution and record that pockets of it were played out against sectarian attacks, physical and verbal.  Not many people in Celtic's past have won more trophies and nobody has been subjected to the kind of poison in winning them that Lennon has. Knocked unconscious in Glasgow's west end, assaulted pitchside at Tynecastle, a suspect device in the post, graffiti on walls, bigotry pouring from stands.  He soaked it all up. People can't see the wood for the trees right now but the fact is Lennon is one of the most significant individuals in the entire history of the club. Down the line, when the smoke clears, him being the manager who lost the 10 in a row is only going to be a part of a much bigger story.  All good things come to an end and the end is certainly nigh for Lennon. It's not a question of if, it's a question of when - and therein lies a world of other points.  If Celtic were thinking straight, they'd have cut Lennon loose by now, in part because of the failings of his team but also in order to save him from the ugly spectacle that's been playing out these past weeks and months. This video can not be played Watch: The Livingston draw that heaped pressure on Lennon  Lennon, despite his rich pedigree at Celtic, has become a targeted figure, a man subjected to viciousness and left twisting in the wind by a board that could initially be praised for backing him but can now only be criticised for letting him suffer on.  Lennon is the type of character who will fight until the last bell, who will refuse to give in despite being repeatedly put on the canvas, his vision blurred, his defences weakened. He always comes back for more, believing he can still triumph against the odds when, it's now obvious, all that's left for him is more punishment.  He won't stop, so somebody needs to stop him. The Celtic board need to reach for the towel. In the Thrilla in Manila in 1975, after 14 rounds of the most brutal heavyweight contest of all time, Joe Frazier's trainer Eddie Futch called a halt to his extraordinary bloody feud with Muhammad Ali.  Frazier, heroic but unable to see out of one eye, protested. ""Sit down son, it's over,"" Futch said, memorably. ""Nobody will ever forget what you did here today."" Lennon, like Frazier, doesn't think he needs an Eddie Futch right now, but he does. And you have to ask, where is that man? Dermot Desmond, the majority shareholder, and Peter Lawwell, the chief executive, cannot still believe that Lennon can turn this around. Their loyalty in giving him every chance is now looking like something else - a lack of leadership and a lack of compassion for the man at the centre of this storm. Celtic fans with longer memories and an appreciation of the things Lennon achieved are beginning to talk about duty of care and the board's responsibility to one of their most committed sons.  They don't like seeing his team unravel, they don't like seeing him left to struggle through questions about his future, they don't like the fact there is nothing but silence on this stuff coming from the Celtic board.  They feel the respectful thing to do here is bring an end to his reign, pay him what he's due and save him the stress of more months of running to stand still.  Save for his interview with Celtic TV when apologising for the trip to Dubai, Lawwell has gone quiet. In the good times, the chief executive was a magnificent operator, an astute decision-maker who was never slow to present Celtic as the model for all others to follow, a club like no other and all of that.  It got a little narcissistic, but Celtic would not be the first champion club to portray themselves as paragon of excellence and they won't be the last. If once sold on Celtic's, and his own, invincibility, this past while would have been sobering for Lawwell.  It's not just on the field where Celtic have lost themselves. In the vacuum we have conjecture. The board is gripped by inertia and doesn't know what to do. The board is moving for Eddie Howe and he'll be in at the end of the season. The board is working on something bigger, a revamp of the football operation including an exit for Lawwell. In the meantime, Lennon is left to plug away, a colossus effectively reduced to the role of a caretaker, warming the seat for the next guy, whoever he is and whenever he arrives. Lennon has won five leagues, four Scottish Cups and one League Cup as manager, he has won the kind of matches in Europe that Brendan Rodgers never won, he has signed class players whose deeds are written into the fabric of the nine in a row - Virgil van Dijk, Fraser Forster, Victor Wanyama just three of them, bought for less than £6m combined and sold to English clubs for £35m with more millions made from sell-on fees.  Those were the good times, but they're gone. Now all that's left are public relations horror shows off the field and grim battles on it. Lennon has done his job and for the large part he's done it well. It's now up to whoever's running Celtic to do theirs.
